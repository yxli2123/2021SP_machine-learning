    It leaks!
  
",1.0,R. Thibodeau,"Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2019","









  
  
    
  Well, this is a first for me - my umbrella actually leaks!I don't know if the photos are clear. The first one shows water on the insider of the umbrella. The second shows a patch near the rib where the fabric is worn thin (there are several of these in other locations too).I've lost umbrellas, had them turn inside out, found them uncomfortable to hold, and had them just plain break. But this is the first one that's ever leaked. Even in fairly light rain I ended up arriving at work with my hair, face, and glasses all wet.I bought it in Feb. 2018 and it sprung a leak a little over a year later. Very disappointing for a top-rated product.

    Mini umbrella that is hard to close
  
",1.0,Mariel,"Reviewed in the United States November 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  This is a miniature umbrella that is very hard to close. The handle is very short and the diameter too small to keep rain away. The auto-open works fine but it is a real struggle to close. The only pro is that it is small enough to fit in a purse or the cubby of your car. However, I have had equally small umbrellas that opened up to full size, so I can't even recommend it based on its small form factor. Two thumbs down.

    good umbrella; not a super long life
  
",4.0,Athanasios,"Reviewed in the United States November 16, 2018","









  
  
    
  The umbrella is amazing. Super easy to use (the spring loaded mechanism is wonderful and super convenient), but I'm not sure it lasts quite as long as they claim. I've had it for over a year now, and it's definitely showing signs that it's beginning to give out. The metal spines are looser, it doesn't pop open as energetically, and the velcro strap that holds it together when not in use is starting to wear out and loose it's grip. Having said that, $20 for a product that lasts a full year of Boston weather and still has juice for another half a year to a year before giving out isn't a bad deal when you think about it. Overall, I recommend it.

  I had this umbrella for a while (I think 2 years??) I've used it quite a lot (I live in Boston). It never developed holes and even when one of the spines of the umbrella became wonky, it still extended properly. I'm only looking for a new one because I left it at a train station.It definitely inverted in a gust of wind, but held up well to minor wind.Pros:- definitely holds up to a beating better than other umbrellas.- it's wind ""resistant"" not proof.Cons:- inverts at a 30+ mph gusts just like every other umbrella. Doesn't seem to break it at least.- the Velcro strap was getting pretty worn out, there was rust, the spines had gotten a little wonky from snagging the umbrella on something. Still it lasted a long time and even with that was functional.- honestly the biggest problem is I just found it too damn small. I'm a bit doubtful of their dimensions but I guess if they're measuring over the top rather than the space underneath that might be plausible. Some part of me was always getting soaked.

  I‚Äôve only had this umbrella for a month now and regret buying it. I unfortunately can no longer return it and honestly disappointed in that. I spent $16.55 for a less than decent umbrella I use to have one I paid $12 for and lasted for years and was huge so this was a complete disappointment. It‚Äôs small to start with and barely covers much and is difficult to close I‚Äôve never had an issue with any other umbrella when it comes to closing the thing. It is compact so it fit well in my large purse and light weight but seriously hard to close and I feel like a dummy when trying to fight it shut. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I would recommend buying another umbrella. It‚Äôs not worth the hassle and price point. It‚Äôs a mediocre umbrella for a price that I believe is too much.

  Given the price, great reviews, and advertising associated with this umbrella, I truly expected a superior product capable of withstanding wind. After over a year of use in New England, I can confidently say that this umbrella will not hold up against strong winds. Your hand and wrist will ache from holding on to the flimsy frame and you will inevitably get turned inside-out repeatedly. I am fed up with this unreliable product.

  I purchased the Repel Windproof Travel Umbrella in September 2016. I have several umbrellas but the Repel umbrella is my go to and favorite umbrella. It's been durable in wind and rain so I was truly upset when a spine broke last month (March 2019). This umbrella is so great I was ready to purchase a replacement but fortunately the Repel comes with lifetime replacement guarantee so I contacted customer service. They responded quickly and sent me a replacement. The Repel umbrella is a solid buy and their customer service is excellent.

    UPDATED: Nice Umbrella, Holds up better than others on the sidewalk
  
",5.0,Brandon H,"Reviewed in the United States January 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  I live and commute in Boston.  It's been really windy recently and I see many umbrellas bending and turning inside out in the poor weather.  Fortunately I made a good choice and purchased the Repel Windproof Travel Umbrella.  It expands out and compresses in quickly and nicely and it packs up small enough to put in my bag after work if its not raining.  My only complaint is that I wish the carrying handle was larger (longer - more cylindrical/extruded & less spherical).  With larger hands it gets uncomfortable after holding for awhile.UPDATE 27Jan2020: I was out in a storm on my way home the other day in extreme wind and rain.  The umbrella stood up to the weather for about 30 minutes, but within 5 minutes of my place, the wind caught it and inverted half of it.  I collapsed it, and re-expanded it to shape and continued home.  When I got home I realized one half of the umbrella lacked the initial tension.  I couldn't find nor fix the problem with analysis at home.  I reached out to the company, Upper Echelon and they were able to help me out with a replacement.

You cannot go wrong with this umbrella if you are looking for a compact size as well as great performance in the wind and rain.

  Update: the customer service is nice and responded promptly offering either a replacement or a refund. They keep their word.I needed a compact umbrella that would fit in my bag. After reading the reviews I decided to invest on an expensive umbrella that would last forever. When I received it I was a bit disappointed by the quality because my first impression was that it looked cheap, it was heavy, it wasn‚Äôt that small when folded and not wide when opened as I expected. Another inconvenience is that when you press the button once it opens all the way but when you press the button again to fold, it doesn‚Äôt let you open it again, you have to use both hands to compress the handle first so then you can use the button to open it again. So when you have one hand busy holding something, it‚Äôs annoying.Yesterday, I went to a lookout and I used my umbrella because it started to drizzle. When I reached the sight point it was a bit windy but not too strong and the umbrella flipped upwards, when I tried to fix it, it was already broken. I was so surprised because the wind was not like really strong.

  These are great little umbrellas.  They perform well and I've used them for both rain and sun. Actually, I sat at a soccer game with two of them propped up behind my head holding off a fierce and beastly storm and they held tough.  Although the rain was coming in sideways and the wind was blowing something treacherous, they were like a little protective shield for me.  The picture is what the storm looked like from my view, you can see the other guys umbrella buckling from facing the terror this Mid-Western deluge.  I would recommend after a few months of use.

    Easy function and lightweight
  
",4.0,Laura P.,"Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2016","









  
  
    
  This is a very nice umbrella for the price.  I had an old umbrella that was one of the first ones to be auto-open AND auto-close.  It lasted forever, and I didn't want to replace it until I could find another one with the same feature.  So my primary reason for purchasing this umbrella is because you can press the button to collapse it.  I'm usually carrying things in both hands and managing a toddler at the same time, so I don't like umbrellas that require the use of both hands to close them.  This one fits the bill.  It easily opens and closes with the push of the button.  It's a personal size umbrella, so it folds up into a small pouch when not in use.  It's not a huge, two-person umbrella, but I'm ok with that.  The only reason I did not give this umbrella the fifth star is because it feels a bit flimsy.  It doesn't have a wind vent, so it seems to get carried away with the wind quite a bit, and the middle pole is a little skinnier than I'm used to, so it's a little tougher to correct its direction in windy situations.  I don't think this umbrella would hold up to a really windy day, but it certainly performs the function of keeping me dry otherwise and making it very easy to open and close.  Since that is the primary purpose of the umbrella, I'm very pleased with it.

  I had a Tote umbrella for over 10 years and it finally decided to give up. I was going to order another Tote umbrella but I received an email about this umbrella from Amazon and I decided to check it out. I read the features and it sounded great (similar to my old umbrella). Nowadays, umbrellas are cheap and would not withstand as long as I had my old umbrella. When I received it, it was about the same weight as my old umbrella (I was actually looking for a lighter umbrella but I wanted one that was strong enough to endure NYC weather). I didn't get a chance to use it until now. It's sturdy and works well. I'm a tiny person so I didn't get wet under it. I think if I were to share the umbrella with someone else, we might get a little wet. I like how there is a button to click for it to open.

  I ordered this umbrella in three colors (I misplace them often and sometimes need a spare for guests) because I found the Wirecutter review that ranked it highest. I have had a rainy spring of testing, and I'm happy to report the Wirecutter review is accurate. The umbrella is well constructed, without the metal arms that tend to get bent out of shape in lesser umbrellas, and the Teflon coating has been effective at keeping rain from soaking through the material. This means it dries quickly or could be collapsed wet for temporary storage in your bag without making too much of a mess. I hope these three I purchased will get me through 2019 at least, but I won't hesitate to order more when the time inevitably comes.

  The construction seems sturdy, better than the cheap ones that you buy when you forgot yours at home.  It opens and closes well, and locks open securely.  I take a bus or the subway to and from work, and its small size makes it easy to carry with me.I had this umbrella for about a month before I had a chance to use it.  The first time I used it, I had to walk a short distance (perhaps 5 minutes) from the bus stop to the office building I was visiting.  It wasn't that windy, and I was being careful to protect the umbrella, but a wind gust inverted it and broke an outer rib.  I think it's still useable, but one side now droops down.  It's a bit disappointing that it failed the first time I used it in conditions that weren't very severe.  It doesn't live up to its claim that is able to ""withstand powerful gusts without turning inside out.""

  I live close to New York Harbor, where the wind blows quite strongly between the tall buildings. On rainy days, I often see many broken umbrellas in wastebaskets, or worse, just thrown on the ground in areas that are only a block or two away from the water because it is often very windy. The Repel umbrellas have been an excellent companion for the last few years through this area. However, one evening, as I was navigating an already often windy area, the gust picked up -- so much so that I could literally not step forward. Then, I heard a crack!Given how gusty it was, I was not surprised that it broke; I seriously thought I was going to fly over Manhattan like Mary Poppins. Nevertheless, I remembered there was a lifetime warranty, so I wrote the company stating that it broke, and within a few days, I had a new one delivered.

  **Update: I'm updating my review from 2 to 4 stars as the company was insanely fast with reaching out to me and getting me a replacement umbrella. I've used the new one twice and so far so good - as I mentioned before, the construction is sturdy but only time will tell if it stays that way. However, would recommend buying this umbrella based on their customer service alone.The ONE time I got to use the umbrella I could tell that the canopy and spokes were pretty sturdy. However, as a couple of other reviews have mentioned, the top piece is either very loose or not constructed well. The second time I went to grab it, I noticed the top piece had disappeared and was nowhere to be found. This causes rain to get into the umbrella...which sort of defeats the whole purpose of having an umbrella. I've owned at least 15 different umbrellas in my life and not one (yes, not even the $5 umbrellas you get from the guys selling on the street when it's raining) has lost the top piece. In fact, I didn't even know it was a removable piece until I found it missing on this one. If the top piece was constructed better, this umbrella would be worth a much higher rating.

  I bought two of these for my and my spouse's upcoming trip to the UK, where we'll most likely need something reliable and sturdy.  It's heavier, at close to a pound, than most cheaper compact umbrellas, but if that means it's built better (and it looks solid) it's worth it.  Pressing the open/close button causes it to spring open like a Batman utensil, so you'd better be clear of obstructions and/or fragile humans.  Pressing the button again causes the canopy to rapidly collapse, although it doesn't retract down the shaft back to the handle.  You have to push down from the top center of the canopy, where there is a hard disk for that purpose, until it clicks into place.  The pleats retain their shape so that you can easily re-store the umbrella back into the carrying sleeve looking like it did when first opened.  I won't know how it will hold up until we start our vacation, but will post an update if there are any problems.

It seems to be good to keep the rain off of you, easy to operate and then fold back down to the original shape to fit into the pouch. I was concerned about some of the reviews I had read, but it seemed to be better than other products. I started out wanting the inverted umbrella in black, but they quickly sold out. So I decided to try out the little on because it fits in the pocket of the car. If all continues to work well, I may order the inverted on once they come back in stock.

This is particular tough if I have multiple packages and or am trying to get into the car while it's raining. But other than that it's an acceptantly well made umbrella. I will buy it again.

  I have not had it long, but this appears to be a very well-built and sturdy umbrella.  For a relatively compact umbrella, it has a nice wide canopy. I've tried it in rain already, and it works fine.The umbrella comes with opening and closing instructions - take a quick look at them before using the product.  Most important, the umbrella opens with some authority and force, and you don't want to have it pointed at anyone.  When closing, press down on the top of the umbrella rather than gripping the ribs, to prevent damage.The umbrella folds down to 11.5 inches, and so I wouldn't call it tiny.  Nor it that light, thanks to its build quality.  Still, it does qualify as compact, and I think it would fit easily in most larger purses and of course backpacks.

  This umbrella may be a fantastic umbrella but I don't really know since I only used it once. The reason for my one-star rating is the false advertising on its size. The Amazon images state that it is 48"" across when measured OVER the top of the umbrella. Who care how big it is OVER the top? I care how big the diameter it is straight across UNDERNEATH the umbrella. I am an engineer by trade so I estimated how big across it would be underneath the umbrella and figured that it would be sufficient before I bought it. Unfortunately in reality it is NOT 48"" across over the top of the umbrella, as I measured with a flexible clothing tape measure it is only 41"" across OVER the top, which means when I measure the actual diameter across UNDERNEATH the umbrella it only came out to be 37"" in diameter. These actual sizes don't come close to what they are claiming. My wife is in a wheelchair and I wanted a larger sized umbrella that would cover both of us when I am pushing her. This doesn't even come close. Size-wise this might be great for one person. For two it's another story.

I get that iron is cheap, yet sturdy. But definitely not the best material for something that will likely get in contact with water regularly or something that will be used during rainy weather. Can't really complain tho due since the price is reallty affordable.Conclusion: Almost perfect umbrella, would've rated 4 stars, but 5 stars instead because of the price.

  I have used this umbrella few times in heavy rains and it has stood up. At this time, I have only had it for about a month, so I can not say how durable it will be. It obviously has a strong mechanism for opening when you press the up arrow on the handle. I think one would be advised to make sure no one is  too close when you press to open. It is a bit on the heavy side, so it is fine for use around town, but perhaps a bit heavy tp pack for travel if you are concerned about baggage limits.

    Most good quality umbrellas can't stand up to winds 20 mph
  
",3.0,Linann,"Reviewed in the United States April 25, 2018","









  
  
    
  I work in New Haven CT, and in the fall, and winter the wind comes right off the water, so I'm always in the market for an umbrella that will last for a couple of years. I learned from experience, that there is no such thing as an umbrella that can stand up to 50 mph. Most good quality umbrellas can't stand up to winds 20 mph. What I'm looking for is a strong auto open/close, and can stand up to heavy rains. This umbrella is very good quality, with a strong open/close button. I will update when needed, as of now I'm very happy with my purchase. Update: 6/11/18. I've used this a few times now, and the inside is starting to rust. I have never had an umbrella do this.

  These are phenomenal, I had one in my backpack, came in handy during the horrible wet spring in Ohio. I think I lost it and immediately needed to buy 2 more, 1 for home and 1 for car. Still hoping I find the one I misplaced or lost. These are super sturdy and convenient, push button, opens, push again, closes. The water-proofness is excellent! One would comically think, aren't all umbrellas ""water-proof""? Um, no...I used one recently, seriously seemed to suck the water out of the rain, and deposited it in my car! Buy several of these, you wont regret it!!!

    Cheap & plastic
  
",1.0,Kathryn Sakai,"Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  I did quite a bit of research when looking for a new umbrella and this was supposedly a good one. It turns out that its not. At first it worked really well until recently when I noticed that it just didn't look right. It hadn't rained in a while so I hadn't used it recently. It turns out that the spokes that support the fabric are metal and very flimsy plastic. The plastic snapped in 2 places. Ridiculous. I really miss the days when umbrellas would last for years and years. This one lasted less than 2.This obviously should NOT be on any list of good umbrellas. Evidently this is no better than a major brand name that has also gone to completely worthless. You're better off just using a trash bag.

  Honestly, I live in San Diego and it doesn't rain very much here. However, this umbrella got great reviews and so I bought it for our occasional showers and visits to rainy places. The umbrella is very well made and sturdy. I feel that it is a bit hard to close ,but perhaps after a few uses it get easier.

    Sturdy and Well-Constructed
  
",4.0,Justin Paul,"Reviewed in the United States August 17, 2017","









  
  
    
  Feels sturdy and a well constructed umbrella. I find that the handle is a little too short to grip, but that is fair as any increase in length of the handle would make the umbrella's overall length longer. Doesn't feel like a flimsy umbrella in any way.Edit: I have had this umbrella for slightly more than half a year now. Having used it for both rain and shine, I have noticed several weak points.‚ë†The strings holding the ribs are mostly loose by now, distorting the umbrella making it worse at handling gusts.‚ë°The joints at the ribs and shaft are starting to show signs of rusts, the rusts also stains the underside of the canopy‚ë¢There was a round cap on top of the umbrella, which is brittle. It broke off and so did the flower shaped design. (Purely aesthetics)I hope it'll last another year or so. I'll update if I have more information to share.

    Sturdy wind resistant umbrella
  
",5.0,Sarah W,"Reviewed in the United States November 21, 2019","









  
  
    
  My new umbrella arrived just in time for 3 days in a row of rain. So my review is based on my initial thoughts. While it is slightly on the heavy side I feel it‚Äôs justified as it seems to be a very strong and study umbrella. When the wind picked up it didn‚Äôt effect the integrity of the umbrella at all. The upper flap allow wind to travel out while keeping it tight enough to not allow water in. Pressing the button will fully open the umbrella. When you push the button again it closes the umbrella and then you have to pull it down to the handle, which takes a bit of strength to do.  also I believe I read on the included info card that it comes with a lifetime warrantee. From what I‚Äôve found cheep umbrellas (which this is not) need replacing 1-2x per year so this benefit alone makes this purchase worthwhile. (Pictured is my 6 yr old daughter who loves using it so keep that in mind when comparing size).

The little string above, when you press the button to open it does not open? The force that open the umbrella broke the little string now the umbrella did not open. I was very disappointed.To make the story short, I contacted the seller & he replies within a few hours! They provide me with a brand new umbrella!! I am thankful for the new umbrella. The material is very nice & it looks durable.In conclusion, the company is open to suggestions to better their product.

",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States August 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this umbrella to replace the last of my broken travel umbrellas. I was immediately impressed by the beefy construction - all of the spokes, stays and other parts are made of heavier gage materials than usual. It's really nicely made. The grip is covered with a rubbery material that feels nice in the hand. Although the umbrella weighs a tad more than my previous very cheap travel umbrellas I would definitely recommend this one. It will probably last much longer than the ultra cheap standard-issue lightweight travel umbrellas, and I will update this review in a few months to confirm. The only thing I noticed that could use improvement is the stitching holding the velcro strap seems a little lightweight - the strap could be a little wider and double stitched.

",4.0,David,"Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  First I had a Totes umbrella which was great for almost 20 Years (!!!) of usage so this is my compare base point.The first thing that catch eyes is its thicker, this umbrella is about 1.5 times thicker than other folding umbrellas I saw, thats probably duo to the two layers.its also 3 cm longer, and not a light weight one.The grip handle is well built with the right length and thickness so it is comfortable for extended grip and gives a very good grip.The opening and closing mechanism, on the one hand, is very fast but also quite aggressive / powerful. Closing the mast itself is quite difficult and the resistance of the mechanism is quite strong so that it requires considerable force to close it back into place.The umbrella mechanism itself seems to be of a high standard and gives the impression of something strong and durable, which will still have to prove itself later.For some reason the umbrella fabric looks a little too thin and gives a little cheap feeling, very much hoping that it makes the wrong impression and that it will actually face significant rainfall without forging.There is one thing that even without use, can be noticed is the closing of the fabric at the edges. Due to the gap between the two layers the fabric does not close properly and it is impossible to achieve a fine and neat closure, the edges of the top layer protrude from all sides and do not fold in.Bottom line: its looks like a good products which was well designed in most aspects but not perfect.Yet not tested under real winter.

  This is an avg sized personal umbrella, so don't think you can fit more than 1 person under it. It folds very compact and would be perfect for a purse or glove box. The handle is very small. The button is nice in that it opens quickly, and the button also partially closes. The main post is extra sturdy but the individual rods and the fabric seem average. I'm returning it because the coverage is too small and the handle is too small.

  Auto open and close is helpful when your hands are full or you are getting kids in the car.

  I got this to replace a cheap $8 umbrella I bought from the drug store a few years back, and the difference in quality is like night and day. The cheap umbrella had gaps in the stitches that let in tiny sprays of rain and sometimes had difficulties closing. The moment I got this umbrella, the difference was pretty clear. It's heavier than the cheap umbrella, despite being a good bit smaller, and I never get any water seeping through, even on heavier rain days. The handle is nice and comfortable to grip, and the auto close is probably my favorite part of the whole umbrella. No more struggling to close the umbrella and getting wet as you also try to maneuver a door open, just step inside while holding the umbrella outside and hit the button to close - and keep dry the entire time. I love it.

It performed flawlessly in a stiff wind. It has two more ribs than the one I just replaced. It seems much more robust and much better made than others I have owned.  After receiving it I received a very nice email from the manufacturer thanking me for my purchase.  What a nice surprise!

  The umbrella appears to be robust; I used it recently during rain and gusty winds in New York with no problems. However, though the ribs seem largely rustproof, I am disappointed to see visible rusting at a couple of the rivets where sections of the ribs are joined, in one case offsetting to the fabric of the umbrella. It makes no sense to me to construct a good frame from rust-resistant materials only to sacrifice that quality with cheap rivets. I‚Äôm disappointed, though I‚Äôll keep this.

The first thing you notice is the material on the umbrella, it appears to be of a much higher quality than my previous umbrella. Then the handle, which for me is just right sized and comfortable to hold. The opening mechanism works very well and the umbrella pops open. The ribs are thicker and appear to be better constructed than my previous umbrella. During the storm, the umbrella performed well, even in the wind. The closing mechanism worked much better than my previous umbrella. It was impressive in how fast it dried out.

  Pros: The umbrella is light in weight, but it is sturdy enough to hold during strong winds. I like the textured handle which is comfortable to hold for a longer time. The fabric seems to repel a lot of water. I feel the fabric is thin but it works right and dries fast.Cons: The initial unit I received had a broken thread connecting the fabric to the support. The replacement unit I received had no such issues.User Tips: The first time you use the product, press the unlock button, but before it unfolds, hold the umbrella and check if the ribs entangle with each other. If so press the top to lock it, then try to untangle the ribs, before unfolding it again. I suspect this might be the issue for the broken thread in the first unit I received.Customer service: I appreciate the customer service and they seem to be invested in customer satisfaction. I received a follow-up email thru Amazon after I received the initial faulty product. I replied to their email stating the issues. They sent me a replacement unit right away.

  We've been experiencing much more rain than previous seasons. After getting caught far too many times out and about exposed to the elements, I decided to get an umbrella to keep in my car. I've owned many different kinds of umbrellas but was never able to count on them functioning in downpours or heavy rains. I was reluctant therefore to go to the local discount box store to drop $20 on an umbrella. I turned to Amazon and decided to try this one. It costs a little more, but I am so pleased with how well it is constructed. I have no doubt it will be durable and will serve me well for many years to come regardless of the weather. As a safety net, even if it were to fall apart on me, the manufacturer and vendor offer a free replacement. Now that's peace of mind! I can't recommend this umbrella enough and the vendor has demonstrated that customer service and follow up is central to their business!

When the lid did flip upward in a heavy wind, it was easy to rotate the umbrella and turn the top down in stages.The automatic open/close feature was nice, however in closing it was difficult to shorten the stem in order to load the spring and return the umbrella to the short length that you see in the photo.

A few days ago, 20 months after purchase, one of the ribs broke. This was under normal use in the Boston area, I did not go to the arctic with it, nor did I have it in the closet all the time. This is probably OK [#]. The umbrella is OK, easy to open/close, and portable [fits in my briefcase easily].[#] 20 months is OK but not tops.

  I have to say this is a vast improvement over any of the cheap umbrellas I have bought at gas stations or box stores.  I love that when you press the button, it fully extends and opens with no assistance needed from the user. When you press the button again it fully collapses all the way, ready to be put away again with minimal effort. It seems sturdy enough. I haven't yet tried to use it to fly over the London skyline like Mary P. but I have a feeling that this would be the umbrella to use were I to have such an endeavor planned.

  So, I‚Äôm giving this away as a gift but I had to check it out early. Really neat. Unsnap the keeper, press the button and the umbrella deploys. I think ( hope my memory is right) you simply push the button again and it collapses neatly right before your eyes. I‚Äôd probably wear it out doing this about 10 times each rainy day, just to see it work. How long will the mechanism work? Unknown right now. How well will it hold up to high winds? Well most likely see just after Christmas! The company is just very professional and caring. I‚Äôve already gotten emails that say if I have any questions or problems, just give them a shout and they‚Äôll take it from there. I really respect companies that back their products and give customers the feeling like they are on the other end of the phone.

  I am a Mechanical Engineer and carbon fiber (as used in the ribs of this umbrella) is, indeed, stronger than most things, but it has less give than most things.To an Engineer ""Toughness"" means how much energy it takes to break something. Polycarbonate plastic, like Lexan, is one of the toughest materials known, because it takes a lot of energy to break it. Some eyeglasses are made of a thin titanium that can be tied almost into knots and still spring back into shape.One of the carbon fiber ribs of our umbrella broke when the umbrella was still disappointingly new. Then I sent several emails with no answer at all. The email <support@upperechelonproducts.com> did work after 3 weeks of several tries. They were very kind and it arrived as promised.They need  your order number, and your best shipping address if that has changed from the address from the place they sent the first one.To end on a good note, the pop open and pop (almost) closed is very nice, as is the Teflon coating. A quick shake and the (still quite new) umbrella is very dry. Not perfectly, but 95% dryer than any other umbrella I have owned. Perhaps 99.99% dryer since some umbrellas drip and make a mess for an hour or more. We will see how long the coating lasts.It did survive some blowouts. One person said that it repeatedly blew out in 10 mph winds, but we have never had trouble in less than 25 mph, or there abouts. At least as good as any umbrella we have owned in my 75 yr lifetime. Those blowouts did not break it. We were passing through a doorway and it hit the door, probably due to the wind and 'ping', one rib died a tragic death.And, I have never had ANY umbrella blow out if the wind is coming ""down from the top"". The issue is when the wind suddenly changes and ""comes up from the handle."" Winds around buildings can be hard to deal with. They also will get you very wet even if your umbrella is welded steel. Any umbrella works ONLY when it is between you and the wind/rain. I am not saying that the complaint did not happen as described. Just that my Repel has never been an issue except in very strong winds that gust from opposite directions.

    Finally an umbrella that can last
  
",5.0,efsch,"Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2019","









  
  
    
  Years ago I had an umbrella made by Knirps in Germany.  It lasted for decades until the cover began to fray.  Since then, my cheap replacement umbrellas usually last for a dozen trips and then the ribs begin to fall apart. This new Repel umbrella looks and feels like it will last as long as my Knirps did.  Too early to tell, but on recent trips it has held up beautifully.  BTW, if you lose your umbrella cover (I always do), you can replace it with a small (below ankle) sock that has lycra in it.  Breathable and works fine.

  This is such a cheap umbrella, I was using it today and it wasn't even raining very hard but it was a little windy. And it blew inside out multiple times. It's super thin and light, it would be a good sun umbrella but thats it. Almost anytime it rains theirs wind with it so a rain umbrella should be able to deal with that. It was shaking like a leaf, I'm surprised it didn't snap in half

    A Sturdy and Surpringly Portable Umbrella Despite its Relatively Large Size
  
",5.0,Juan E.,"Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2019","









  
  
    
  As a college student, umbrellas are extremely important since rain poses a threat to damaging anything important that I have either in my backpack or on my person. Prior to having this backpack, I had a slightly more compact umbrella that I used. It was fairly smaller than this one so it was a little more portable; however, it often proved to be too flimsy and would get inverted once a strong gust blew by. My old umbrella was also small when opened, so I would often find that my legs would be wet even if my torso was dry. This new umbrella doesn't seem to suffer from any of those issues that my old umbrella had. It is signficantly sturdier and more comfortable to hold, it is larger when opened, and it was still light and easy to carry. I can still comfortably keep it tucked into one of my two water bottle pockets when not in use. Overall, I reccomend this umbrella; it even includes a warranty from the manufacturer once you sign up for it.

  I've bought three of these in the last 3 years. Not because they break, but because they're so good. Two of them are in my car; they fit in my car door pockets so I have one in the drivers side and one in the passenger side. The third and latest one was a lightning deal and will be a spare in case I need a third.They are a nice size when closed up and the extending and closing mechanisms are strong and work well. If you close it while pointing it at the ground, most of the water will splash off due to the teflon coating.I also like the availability of so many different colors (they might be listed separately).Will probably end up getting more as gifts.

  Push the button to open and lock the runner, push it again to close without pulling down the runner.  Then just collapse the handle further to arm it for next time.  And you can collapse and lock the handle without having to fit the tips of the ribs inside the handle.  It has a ventilated 2 piece fabric so it does not invert so easily in a gust of wind.  This is a great christmas gift for the person who has everything.

    Best umbrella ever & amazing customer service
  
",5.0,Gireesh,"Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought this in late 2016 for traveling throughout Asia. It's not a large umbrella, so as a 6' man, it doesn't protect my lower body much in heavy/windy rain. But I knew that going in. What it CAN do is stand up to pretty much any amount of wind and rain. It never folded back on me, never had any mechanical glitches, never lost the little nubs on the end of the spines to create eye-poking hazards, etc. etc. All that and it has a great small profile for traveling. Half the time I use it at a steep angle against driving rain, and I have no problems. Best umbrella I've ever owned.Then last month the cap at the top point somehow came off! It looks like it was a screw (I can see the inner threads) that was locked in place with some glue. I never saw it fall off (one minute it was open and working, 10 minutes later I try to reopen it and the screw is gone). It must have just worked itself loose over the years. I abused this umbrella pretty good over the past couple years, so I'm not surprised. I toss it on the floor, jam it into bags, shake it very hard to remove excess water when going inside, do the fast open-close-open-close to flap off excess water. Abused, but never had a problem. But without this cap, the umbrella won't stay open.I was super bummed. But it turns out the company has an amazing return policy. Through Amazon's seller message system there were almost no questions asked, and a new one is on its way to me. Very easy, low effort process. I couldn't be happier. I can't believe the quality and durability of this thing for the price point. Very much worth it.

  In theory, fine ‚Äì ‚Äì light and compact. However, after extremely limited and light use, two of the sewn anchor points holding the material to the frame came undone, resulting in the material flapping and a hole. This was not a result of wind or even wear and tear, just bad machine sewing. The worst part ‚Äì ‚Äì I mailed it back to the address included on the tag for lifetime warranty in New Jersey. Undeliverable. Return to sender. So I am out the cost of one umbrella, plus $8.25 mailing cost (to an apparently now defunct company) to add insult to injury. Avoid at all costs this defective product, with no warranty backing whatsoever, despite the fictional claim to the contrary.

  I've used this once so far, on a standard rainy day (no high winds).  I guess it remains to be seen, just how much better this particular umbrella may be, at standing up to the wind, etc.One thing I DID notice right away that's better about this model?  The included case or sleeve to keep your umbrella in....it's a LOGICAL size...  In other words, with most other umbrella sleeves, you have to FIGHT to get your umbrella back inside the sleeve.  The sleeve for the Repel model is quite generously sized.

    Inverts with the slightest gust
  
",1.0,M. Alexander Greifenkamp,"Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2019","









  
  
    
  Replaced a cheap travel umbrella I bought that finally kicked the bucket after 5 years. On its maiden voyage, this thing turned inside out after maybe a minute and a half. One ~10mph gust was enough to do it. It was ""sturdy"" in the sense that it didn't break with that and I flipped it back... and then it did it again a couple minutes later. It's good that it's not permanently breaking I guess, but it's effectively useless as an umbrella in pretty much any situation other than a light sunshower.It desperately needs wind vents, and I will be returning it and replacing it with literally any other umbrella that actually has them. I mean you sneeze at this thing and it'll go inverted.

    Not For Heavy Rain Or Super Windy Weather
  
",3.0,Christian Perez,"Reviewed in the United States August 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  It's a mini umbrella that will do the job for light-medium (0-0.3in rain) precipitation, however it won't cover you and your backpack unless you are a fairly thin person.Two or Three exposures of wind to the underside of the umbrella messed up 1 of the hinges on my umbrella, so now it's hard to open it as quickly.Umbrella will develop holes throughout time, though I found them acceptable up until now - so that's about 2 years of using this umbrella. The holes are probably due to not enough durable fabric tethered to the umbrella hinges.Develops a fair amount of rust, should not expect to use this past 1-2 years.

It keeps me dry and has never inverted due to the wind (pet peeve). Want to know something else about this umbrella? The company that sells it is amazing with its customer service and lifetime warranty policy. The button started to not work as well (sometimes have to press it 2-3 times before it reacts) so I reached out to the company. Not only did they respond in record lightening speed time, the company sent out a replacement. This all happened in 12 hours!? Highly recommend this umbrella. I rarely give out 5 stars for anything but have to say between the quality of the umbrella and the customer service/lifetime guarantee, you can't go wrong.

  I would have preferred to use this umbrella more before writing a review of it, but after two requests I'm writing one a bit prematurely.  I tried it out briefly today.  It seems to be a very nice umbrella of excellent quality.  It seems sturdy and is easy to operate.  I tried it briefly when it rained today, but there was no wind so I can't comment about how well it works in wind and I mostly got it because its design is supposed to make it especially good when wind accompanies the rain.  It is supposed to be a travel umbrella, but it seems a bit heavier than I'd want for travel.  That is the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five.  Of course, it's a bit of a trade-off since a very light umbrella is not too likely to be sturdy.

  When you look for an umbrella, you want one that will keep you dry, right? It certainly does that and efficiently! I was going to a ball game and needed a compact umbrella that fit within the venue's guidelines and I chose this one based on so many great reviews.  The only drawback is that is a little on the heavy side, but it's compact size and great features make up for that. I like how you can extend the umbrella as you are exiting a vehicle and collapse it as you are re-entering the vehicle.  I did get to use it in some fairly high winds and it seemed steadier than other umbrellas I have used.  Also easy to store, but another drawback it that it's small size makes it harder to find when it rolls under the car seat, but I guess if that's my worst problem, that's not too bad!

  I live up here in this place that is far from the hustle and bustle of human settlement, isolated and forlorn; the land stretches from view in an endless unbroken wilderness of forest and marshland, where wolves roam and food is scarce.When we venture forth to seek sustenance it is a hard trek and at the end of it is bound to be disappointment and failure; for it is a forbidding and unforgiving world and it is best left to the beavers who make it their home.The wind makes this its eternal home, but it is the rain that dispenses pure evil, for it is relentless in its character, and it pours without pity or regret.Thus to find protection from this endless rain (which pours also at night), it is befallen to us to try first the general store, who more likely than not are bereft of stock or, if possessing of it, are wont to ask a frightfully dear remuneration, as they remind us, the effort of having obtained these items is extreme and these resources inabundant.Thus it is behooven us to venture to the towns and villages, for which the hiring of ponies and driver is a tiresome and thankless task . . . Mr. Tremblay and his native assistant hew not to a civilized demeanour.""Je vay pah la bah,"" he shouts (for he is hard of hearing from excessive shots from his gun) ""Say troh lwahn."" I understand him not, no matter how loud his entreaties.Yet in this land we call Kanata (although others call it differently) the rumours flew of a magical place that was a mighty river named Amazon, that flowed with bounty and richness, and also umbrellas.Mr. Tremblay was persuaded, with an envelope addressed to the postmaster of the river outpost named Amazon (and a pouch of good Kanatian silver), to carry forth my plea for an umbrella that could withstand the rain of Kanata and perhaps aid in fending off raccoon dogs that come like thieves in the night to steal our corn crop, for it was rumoured that this umbrella could explode with a fearful clamour, much like a gun.And so it was, that in the month of May, at the peak of the rains, Mr. Tremblay and his assistant Kemosabeh returned bearing a parcel upon which was marked, Amazon.com, the meaning of which I know not.And inside the package was wrapped the most magnificent of objects, a teflon exploding umbrella named Repel, which, although small in stature, when expanded with much conundrum, becomes a wand of wondrous skill, rebuffing the most energetic assaults of rain and wind, and, perhaps, raccoons.After much fanfare, Mr. Tremblay, Kemosabeh and I, holding the Repel umbrella above us to stave off the heavens‚Äô expulsions, ventured forth into the Kanata bushlands in search of our own Amazon, far from fear and hunger and raccoons.Thus it was that we came unto Amazon.ca.With much reluctance (for in the short time we had possessed it, the umbrella had become rather dear) we handed it to the Postmaster and commanded him to go forth and multiply this umbrella into many umbrellas, and then ship them thereupon, for amazon.ca does not have the Repel umbrella and I JUST WANT TO KNOW JUST WHAT IT IS ABOUT CANADA THAT YOU FOLK DON'T LIKE.

I've taken it out on a couple of walks in the rain and it definitely does the job of keeping the user dry. It's not huge, so your feet and lower legs may still get wet. I was also impressed by how much of the water was shed off the top of the umbrella when coming inside out of the rain. It appears the teflon coating is really a thing. The sleeve it comes with is a bit of a pain to use, but I'm sure it will come in handy when out and there's no where to stash the wet umbrella. About once a year Amazon has a flash sale on these, so keep your eyes on it and you might be able to get it for a few dollars off.

  Yes, the automatic close feature really works. Have you ever noticed how awkward it is to get into a car with a regular umbrella while it's raining? As you're wrestling with the umbrella to close it, you can get soaked. With this umbrella, you can enter your car and close your door most of the way so the umbrella is still sticking out above the door and keeping the rain away. Then you press the button and the ""dome"" of the umbrella collapses. That allows you to pull it inside while the door remains almost closed. You will still get a couple splashes of water on you, but you won't get soaked like you do with a regular umbrella. Very clever design -- and it works! I'm giving this umbrella 5 stars based on that trick alone. I can also say it has the feel of a quality umbrella. I've been using it about three months in moderate winds without any issues.

  I purchased this umbrella 4 months ago after reading countless reviews about how it holds up against heavy winds. I had been looking for a travel-sized umbrella strong enough to not flip inside out  during windy weather. It is very light and easy to use. It also does a great job at protecting from the sun, but contrary to it's name it DOES NOT hold up against windy weather. A couple days ago I was using the umbrella during a walk on a hot day, and as soon as the wind picked up regular force the umbrella flipped inside out. Of course I immediately proceeded to adjust it.... nobody likes the unwanted attention from people staring to see what happens next. About a minute later it happens again.... If it can't hold up against regular winds it really shouldn't be making such a bold statement in it's name.

  First and foremost I love the umbrella. It works great in windy conditions and water does not stick to it. It dries immediately. I love the design. Press a button and it unfolds. Press again and it retracts.Okay, now for the customer service part. I opened the umbrella the first time and it unfolded just as designed, but I noticed something didn't look right. A small part had been missed during the manufacturing process. So minor that I really didn't give it much thought and was able to fix it myself. The company requested that i give them a review and I emailed them that I would give them only 4 stars because of that problem. They emailed me back and would stop at nothing to make it right.Honest, integrity and honor. Three things sorely lacking in today's world. The very things that make it a pleasure to do business with these folks. Give them a try. They won't disappoint. 5 stars +.

  It is by far the best compact umbrella you can get for the price. It is very sturdy at any price. It is not a hurricane proof umbrella but it is great for any rainy conditions you will be out in. The fiber glass is far more durable than the classic aluminum! There are aluminum parts but they are sturdy. It with stands up force winds but as the one video shows, a 40 mph down force will fold it but not break it! Speaks volumes! I highly recommend!

  This umbrella seems very sturdy.  Great that it opens and closes automatically.  Huge variety of colors to choose from.  The thing I‚Äôm most impressed with is the customer service.  This company made sure (all via emails) that I received the product, if I was satisfied, etc.  From the other reviews, if anything goes wrong with the umbrella, it has a lifetime warranty.  I‚Äôve only used the umbrella once thus far, but if all goes well I will definitely be buying another one!

    Interesting combination of ""portable"" and ""protection"".
  
",5.0,Incubatorjones,"Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2019","









  
  
    
  1st thing - push the button to close. That has come in handy more than once just before you get into a car or restaurant when its pouring rain. Dries pretty quickly. Note: it does not retract all the way down to the handle - just the top collapses on itself, the main stem stays extended. The build quality is good enough for 10-20 mph windows but any big gusts of 30+ will stress it. When open it covers enough of me to stay dry without being too big or too small to carry around while it is open. A good combination of protection and portability so I use it 80% of the time and my ""monster"" umbrella when the weather or wind is really bad.

I used it for 45 minutes, closed it and then opened it up again five minutes later and it wouldn‚Äôt stay open. A string was sticking out from the top and it no longer works. Very very disappointed.

  Commuting to New York, I wanted a more compact umbrella that opened fairly wide and held up to the crosswinds of Manhattan.  This umbrella checks all of the boxes.  My only recommendation to the company that produces this umbrella would be to change the casing that the umbrella comes in.  Instead of a tight fit which is hard to navigate, I would prefer a zipper enclosure.  Other than that, I have nothing but good things to say about the quality and functionality of this umbrella.

  Never thought I would be Amazon shopping for umbrellas but when I read all the reviews and that it had a one time replacement warranty I had to try it. My work parking lot is a 3 minute walk to the door so I needed something sturdy, lightweight that could fit in my purse. This umbrella is easy just push a button to open, then push the down arrow to close and poof it closes. So far so good. Some may struggle to shorten the umbrella when closing to lock it in place. Other than that great buy

    A great umbrella with solid hearty construction. A tad on the small side though exactly as advertised
  
",5.0,Yubo Su,"Reviewed in the United States September 13, 2017","









  
  
    
  Disclaimer: I haven't been able to use the umbrella under very rainy conditions.I got to pull out the umbrella for the first time today in a light drizzle with some fair wind. The umbrella is definitely a bit smaller than my previous one; I hadn't taken measurements of it but it was probably more so the 60'' ones. This one for me at 5'9"" meant my shins and shoes would get slightly wet if there was any wind. Not a big deal, but just letting people know.The construction feels extremely solid. The action is smooth, and especially when pushing the umbrella back in, you can feel the pole being a snug, well-lubricated fit, i.e. when you push down on the umbrella to fold it back up it slides very smoothly. My old umbrella's pole would noticeably wobble back and forth when folding it back up, so this was a welcome change.It definitely does very well in wind. I intentionally turned it to catch the wind and see how it did, and the legs all flexed but did not give! The wind was pretty gentle but gives me hope. Its ability to do this without the flaps that let the wind pass is particularly impressive.Definitely deflected rain itself pretty well, and seemed to have come home drier than I expected, probably meaning the rain slid off of it more easily than it did my old umbrella. Seems to suggest at either a smoother surface that doesn't let water collect or a hydrophobic coating that lets water slide off more easily. In any case great there too!

  This is my second purchase of this umbrella.  It folds nice and small so it's great for travel or even just a night out.  Opens to a reasonable size and is very durable.  Also nice that it opens and closes automatically.  When getting out of the car in the rain I just stick it out the door opening and pop the button.  No need to get out in the rain then open.  Just reverse the process getting in.  Highly recommend this umbrella.

  Purchased this umbrella because it had great reviews and I was willing to spend a little more for quality. However, I‚Äôve now had the opportunity to use it multiple times and I‚Äôm completely underwhelmed. Umbrella constantly flips out in low wind, button on handle also closes the umbrella which has happened to me while walking in the rain and you have to completely compress the umbrella just to get it to open back up. Save some money and get a cheaper umbrella, I would not purchase again.

  I thought I found a good, cheap umbrella finally...I was wrong. Just like all the others, it seems okay at first until it fails you when you really need it. My issue is that it takes way too much effort to actually close up the umbrella. Yes, it does automatically close when you press the button, but to collapse the pole is just way too hard. If you are older and trying to deal with it, I feel sorry for you. I have to go in and out of three buildings when going to work. Sometimes reopening the umbrella does not work. As much as you try, the canopy will not stay open. The other day I nearly just threw it into the garbage when I finally got inside. Just another piece of junk in my life that I do not need.

  For a compact umbrella, it's a ""big"" umbrella with great coverage.  It opens in a snap, closes almost as easily.  I bought it for an upcoming trip but will no doubt continue to use it as my mobile umbrella (keep in the car).  Only negatives were it's weight (a bit hefty for travel), and the instructions tell you to push the red button to open/close.  There is no ""red"" button, it's a black button but clearly marked with white up and down arrows, so was not a big issue.  The warranty is exceptional, never seen one like it on an umbrella at this price.

  2/15 UPDATE: The company reached out to me and sent a replacement, which I very much appreciate. Customer service was great and very efficient. The new umbrella seems good so far. Hopefully it holds up better than the last one!I've had this umbrella for about 7 months. It was decent overall - not too bulky, kept me dry, held up decently in the wind, the auto open/close worked well. However I did notice it started to rust a couple of months ago, even though I usually keep it open to air dry when I am at home or work. Then today one of the ribs broke when I opened the umbrella. So it wasn't even a strong wind that took it out, just using the automatic open/close. I had  decent run with it but did expect it to have a bit more life before breaking with normal use.

  Reviews prompted me to buy this one.It's a 'nice' farily lightweight & compact-ish umbrella.Alas the first stormy day I needed it, it was a complete fail in terms of practical effectiveness.Yes, it was windy, but I'm taking sustained winds in the upper teens, probably 17-19Mph.Opened my car door held it up, depressed button to deploy so I could step out of the car without getting soaked by steady, though not torrential, rain and it instantly turned inside out.I was like, dang it, but hey the wind is kind of blowing that direction, I quick stepped out turned to face into the wind and it popped 'back' normally, but I have about a 125 yard walk from the parking area to the nearest entrance door of my work place. Even trying to strategically position my body and walk in a way that would keep the umbrella outer canopy facing into the wind, it managed to get flipped inside out 2 more times.It's fine for straight rain, but a complete fail for help when you REALLY need it.My quest for a decent umbrella that isn't so huge as to be cumbersome to stick in my backpack for easy commuter storage / access continues.Disappointed.Pros, Lightweight, medium size, dries quickly.Con, cant stand up to moderate winds.By the way that ridiculous video showing it in 41Mph winds is useless since it's facing the wrong way. I bet if it were show the other way around, it'd flip inside out before 12Mph.

  Update #2: I cannot say enough good things about this umbrella.  It is so light I carry it in my tote to work almost every day in summer. I love the small size and how easily it opens and closes. Yesterday for the first time I got to see how it held up in really heavy rain. It was pouring for hours in Center City, Philadelphia.  As I left my office, I passed a crowd of people gathered  in the building lobby, waiting in vain for the rain to stop.  I opened my little umbrella and hit the sidewalk.  It kept me 100% dry until I got to my car.  It closes so easily that I was able to get into the driver's seat and close it from there.Update: I lost my first Repel umbrella in August and ordered a new one. I had a slight issue with the second umbrella, and customer service could not have been more helpful. These people really stand by their product. I've now had a chance to use the new umbrella several times since it's been raining almost non-stop in my area for days. Here are all the things I love about it: (1) it's so small and light I can carry in my tote and forget it's there; (2) it opens and closes easily; (3) it's easy to carry in the rain because it's so light, and I haven't had any issues using it in the wind; (4) it is very water repellent; (5) because it's so repellent it dries quickly, and I can just shake off water and go into a building without dripping.  It's on the small side so obviously doesn't cover as much area as a huge umbrella, but I hate the big ones even in heavy rain because they're so cumbersome to carry. This is my perfect umbrella.

  I live in a major city and needed a collapsible umbrella suitable for travel on mass transit. I also need one that can withstand crosswinds from river to river winds. This umbrella is perfect!

It's a little bit heavy, just a little, BUT the benefits far outweigh (lol) this minor detail.

  After doing a fair amount of research on travel umbrellas, I settled on the Repel Windproof Travel Umbrella. It arrived per my expectations and was appropriately packed. The unit appears to be of reasonable quality, although I haven't used it very much yet to see how it does over the long haul (provided I don't lose it!). Best features: 1) The fiberglass ribs - I expect these to hold up better than the typical lightweight and highly bendable ribs that are found in drugstore umbrellas. 2) The Up/Down button - I normally expect an umbrella to have button or switch that opens it. The ""Down"" part of the button was pleasant surprise. It makes retraction of the canopy so much faster and easier. Getting into a car after walking across a rainy parking lot is much easier. However - be forewarned - if you hit the Down button while the umbrella is overhead, you get the shower you were trying to avoid! I've only had it out in the rain once so far. There wasn't much wind, so I can't comment on that aspect of this umbrella. It did provide expected coverage for the size of its canopy, and as mentioned above, it is easy to open and collapse. Great product!

  I often make the mistake of buying flimsy umbrellas because they have a cute print and are small enough to fit in my purse. While this umbrella is a simple black color and is a little larger and heavier than my usual purse umbrella, I was happy to have it with me the last time I got caught out in the rain. It opens and closes smoothly and easily with the push of a button so I wasn't worried about pinching my fingers. While it's not that wide, it's extremely sturdy whenever there's any wind to worry about, and did a much better job keeping me dry than the umbrella I was using previously. It also dried very quickly, so that I could fold it up and put it back in my purse without waiting a long time. [Note: I received this product to test and review.]

  i love this thing, the one button push is awesome. by far the most convenient to open and close umbrella that i've ever owned. i have used it in down pouring rain multiple times and it has kept most of me dry, save my shoes and shins which always get wet, this is because the umbrella is compact. not a design flaw though as making the umbrella bigger would... make it bigger, and heavier. it hasn't been super windy when it rained though so i can't test the wind claim, although it did not fold up in whatever wind there was.unfortunately though i can not really recommend the umbrella as the metal springs under the umbrella rust over time. i guess they do not have any kind of anti corrosion coating. a big no no for something that is designed to get wet! it is already at the point where there is rust powder underneath the thing when i open it from touching the rusty metal springs. i imagine eventually they will just snap and cause the umbrella to fail completely.

    Best All-Around Compact Travel Umbrella I Could Find
  
",5.0,Joseph Moutard,"Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2017","









  
  
    
  Before I made this purchase, I checked a pretty decent number of reviews and comparisons.  Granted, I've had umbrellas in the past, but I'd never made an informed purchase when selecting one for myself.  Generally, I just grabbed whatever was on sale at my local retailer and happened to be an acceptable color.  I had accepted as fact that compact travel umbrellas would always have tiny, flimsy canopy coverage that required me to huddle beneath them while my arms and anything I was carrying got soaked and that the first noteworthy gust of wind would render them useless, if not destroy them.  After my last umbrella experienced a catastrophic failure from a relatively normal breeze, I decided that there has to be a better product and that I was going to find it.My requirements were that it had to be compact enough to fit into my glove compartment, feature auto-open/close, and open with a large enough canopy for me to walk comfortably and remain dry with something in my arms.  My search led me to the Repel Easy Touch, which had come out at or near the top of many comparison tests and had an endless list of stellar reviews.  I can honestly say that the people were not wrong.  I absolutely love this little umbrella.  At 11.5"" when compacted, it is amongst the smaller end of its class and easily fits in my glove compartment.  However, it pops out to a generous 42"" canopy that offers great coverage for all but the largest of individuals.  Not only does it do these things, but it has a look and feel that imparts obvious quality and attention to design.  Press that little button and the canopy deploys with very authoritative speed and power that is sure to impress the user, as well as any nearby witnesses.  The main shaft appears to be thicker and more substantial than most.  The 9 sturdy ribs hold the canopy quite taut and do incredibly well on windy days for a lightweight single-canopy design (there are heavier and larger dual-canopy umbrellas that are stronger, but they don't meet my needs here).  And of course, it dries instantly when you're out of the rain, with the auto-close working every bit as well as the auto-open.The bottom line is that I love this umbrella and am extremely pleased that I decided to spend a little bit more to get a better value.  The follow-up email from the company after purchase and the fact that they back their product with a lifetime warranty further evidence the quality of the product and sweeten the purchase experience.  So if you need or want a compact travel umbrella, I highly recommend this product.  It is definitely worth the few extra dollars.

  The Repel travel umbrella is a good sized, well-rated, travel umbrella. The claim of windproof and sturdiness is a bit overstated, as I noted upon inspection of its construction when it arrived. However, it is certainly as good as others I have seen construction-wise. For some reason I expected it to have a larger canopy but it is not undersized and may have been a misunderstanding on my part. At 22 plus dollars, I don't see it being twice as good as those available at local stores. Again, regarding the 'windproof' and sturdiness claims--- just an inspection of the construction in a side by side comparison shows that it is not as superior as the advertising leads one, or at least me, to think it is. I hope to be pleasantly surprised that instead of buying 2, 11.00 dollar umbrellas and having them last, perhaps, twice as long that i made the right decision to buy 1 at twice the price.

  Product does what it says it does so far. But feels cheap. The skeleton worries me and after closing, the shorten the pole it is an absolute pain. There is no leverage to pull the main piece down, and you have to pull it almost into the handle to get it to stay. This is a pretty glaring design flaw and I have small hands. Trying to close this thing even with my small hands is awful. The ribs get in the way of the itty bitty grip point to de-telescope this umbrella. Overall a decent umbrella, but NOT a $20+ piece of equipment. I'd give $7 for it. But it is in no way worth $20 or more. Go to Walmart or Home Depot and get an umbrella. The only reason I'm not returning the item is b/c it's a pain to go out to ship it back or find a box for a pickup.

    One of the best compact umbrellas available
  
",5.0,.* Paradox *.,"Reviewed in the United States May 17, 2019","









  
  
    
  I have purchased three of these umbrellas in various colors and all are superb quality at a great price. They fold up to a compact size and unfold to a perfect size for most people. The ribs are very sturdy and not thin and cheap like too many umbrellas in this class. The umbrella for some can be hard to close if you try to pull down from the inside of the umbrella. Instead, hold one hand on the bottom of the on Bralla and press down using your other hand from the top outside of the umbrella, that makes it considerably easier to close. I will be recommending these umbrellas to friends and family.

  I've been buying from Amazon for years and have never written a review before. The customer service from this company was so great I decided to write one. I bought this umbrella 4 years ago in 2016. One of the metal rods that keeps it from collapsing bent/caved in during a windy storm, so now it would often collapse although it was still usable. I just learned to deal with it.Years later in 2020 I decided I'll finally replace it I was shopping for a new umbrella, Amazon had this listed as I purchased it before. I decided to contact the seller and tell them it broke, figuring it was worth a shot. They mailed me a replacement, no questions asked. For a 4 year old purchase. I've yet to see another company treat their guaranty like that, I'm very impressed. So yea it should have stood up to the wind but hey if it doesn't, they will replace it free of charge so you can feel safe about the purchase !

  I purchased this umbrella 18 months ago and have used it with great pleasure. The umbrella is a quality product, which opens and closes easily and provides protection in even the heaviest rain. Just recently, one of the spindles became dislocated, and I contacted the company. This experience reaffirmed the 5-star impression I already had of the umbrella. Their customer support representatives were extraordinarily responsive and graciously communicated with me. Without asking for the original one to be returned, they are rapidly sending a replacement umbrella. This is the sort of customer support that would encourage me to purchase from them in the future and offer my strongest recommendation.

    Good lightweight umbrella
  
",4.0,William Sung,"Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2019","









  
  
    
  I like this umbrella due to the one touch button that collapses and raises the umbrella. This is a very neat trick and i love it. But even in slight wind i have had this umbrella reverse so iw ould say if it is windy in your city  look for something a little stronger otherwise this works great in low wind and rainy areas. I used this in Japan for a travel trip and it was very lightweight and sleek in my backpack. I like the black color and it was good at keeping the rain out for 1 person comfortably and 2 people could get by for a short distance.

  The price was great, $20 with Amazon coupon! It is a small umbrella so if you're looking for a larger, ""golf type"" umbrella this is not for you - but, if you are looking for a travel size umbrella that appears to be quite sturdy but yet lightweight, this is for you! Haven't had the opportunity to use it in the wind/rain yet but when I opened it outside it opened quickly and easily, with the push of the button. Suitability size for business travel use (one person coverage). Looks well constructed. Was easy to retarct and pout back in the case.

    Best Umbrella

  It is both light weight and sturdy. Great design. Strong automatic open and close action. It is the perfect compact umbrella in my opinion.I recently purchased another compact umbrella that looked like it had the same features and would be equivalent for a few dollars less. But it wasn't nearly as good. It was much heavier, bulkier and the automatic open and close features were weak. I had to shake the umbrella to get it to open and close properly.Stick with Repel. It is a winner and worth the few extra dollars if you really want the best. I know I will.

  Change from 2 to 5 stars.  After a not-so-great impression, I sent a message to the seller who promptly asked if I wanted a refund or replacement.  Needing an umbrella I asked for a replacement.  It arrived quickly and at no cost.  One of my original issues was that the button to open requires far too much effort, so does closing it.  This is still true, but I've come to realize the product (including this part) is well made.My first time using it was during a rainstorm with 50 mph gusts.  I walked 3 blocks from my work to a parking garage.  The umbrella inverted twice.  After that it did not open automatically (popped up but required manual pushing to lock in place.  I am grateful for the free replacement.

  I was drawn to this product from an article that called this a near perfect Amazon rating and almost indestructible.  No knocks on Repel because it was someone else that made that claim.  When I looked it up on Amazon, it was a Deal of the Day offer priced at only $17 so I bought it.Compact, light, and the open/close button makes it quite handy!In fairness regarding quality, I want to compare this to the typical umbrellas sold at Walgreens/CVS and the convenience shops due to consistent price point.  The quality and the features surpasses those generic ones easily.First time using the umbrella and it turned inside out on me while walking through downtown Chicago.  Wind gusts were only about 12 mph, so wasn't even severe.  I would like to see some way for the wind to vent through the umbrella like in the larger golf umbrellas.I think it's a better umbrella for travel/convenience at the $17 price point.  If I paid the $23, I would've rated somewhere between a 3 to 4 star.

    it is still like new. Great construction
  
",4.0,MC Oddslice,"Reviewed in the United States August 14, 2016","









  
  
    
  Update: Too small! If there is wind, you will get wet. It kept my head and upper torso dry when I angled it toward the wind. After several months of use, it is still like new. Great construction. The automatic open and close still works, but if there is wind this is a child's umbrella, and you'd be better off with a rain coat, poncho, or bigger umbrella.I did NOT receive a discount for my opinion. This review is based on my initial impressions after receiving the product and nothing more.Packaging: Inside the shipping box, the umbrella did not come in a box of it's own. It was in a plastic sheathe that was slightly too short to encase the handle. The handle was protected by bubble wrap with a rubber band to hold it securely in place.Build: It was exactly as pictured. I expected the handle to be softer, like a gel, but it is a hard plastic with a rubber like surface for improved grip. The build looks sturdy, though I am a little concerned that bottom rod and top rods have a little bit of rotational wiggle. Also, there were some spare loose threads on the end of one of the spokes where it had been tied off. I expected to be able to feel some type of coating, but the fabric feels really thin, and I couldn't see or feel any difference.Functionality: BEWARE! When you first receive it the button may have been pressed already. I unwrapped the strap, and the umbrella sprang out immediately! Be sure you don't have it aimed at anyone, yourself included! I pressed the button, and it sprang closed. It did take some strength to push it back in. It may be difficult for children and some adults. The average person won't have a problem with it. I closed it and opened it 4 or 5 times. It performed consistently and flawlessly.Final Thoughts: It seems to be sturdy, and it opens and closes as it should. For $50.00 I'd like to have seen a gel handle on it, but it was on sale for $20.95, and didn't advertise a gel handle, so I can't take any points away for not being as advertised. We don't get much wind here in Missouri, but the price was right for having a lifetime warranty. I will update this rating after I've tried it in the rain, and or if the open/close mechanism fails.

  I purchased this umbrella after having one too many cheaper models flip inside-out, tear, or simply stop working. This model came highly recommended by another website, and after reading through reviews I knew this was the umbrella for me. The compact size is perfect for carrying around while folded, and can easily fit in a laptop bag or even larger coat pockets. The opening button is sturdy enough so that it doesn't get pushed accidentally, but at the same time is easy to push when needed. The canopy size is great for keeping me dry, but not so large that I worry about hitting anyone else with it while walking down the street.So far I have used it in several very windy rainstorms, and have not yet had it come close to flipping inside-out. The fabric is likewise holding up extremely well, with no signs of tears or holes. I'm definitely glad that I did my research and came up with this umbrella that is easily worth its price and then some.

  I read about the Repel Easy Touch umbrella on a website that tests consumer products. Of the many umbrellas tested, this came out on top.  After ordering and examining it, I can say with confidence that it is sturdily built with quality materials. It opens & closes with satisfying authority. The handle is dimpled & comfortable to hold. The fabric is treated with teflon, so it sheds rain. The canopy provides enough coverage, so you'll be well protected from the elements. I've spent twice as much on a German-designed umbrella, that was also well built, & this umbrella is it's equal in nearly every respect. Note: It has a little weight to it, & the heavy duty spring might make it a challenge for the elderly to close. Beyond that, what more could you want in an umbrella?

  So to start off with this umbrella is awesome!  The worry of ""as seen on tv"" quality was there with  an auto open/close umbrella but I thought I'd give it a shot anyhow. First thought I had was it doesn't rain enough in Arizona to do this thing justice. So during a training course in a winter storm in California it was put through the ringer from hard downpour and winds to snow/sleet wind mix for days.  If it wasn't for my associate borrowing it and then leaving it open to where the winds took it tumbling about a half mile before hitting a fence and bouncing off of metal and muddy objects along the way it wouldn't have needed replacing.  All of that and only one arm broke which left the umbrella still useable. Just not %100.So I purchased another one as we are moving to a rainy part of the world and it dawned on me that they had a warranty of some sort.  Yeah yeah... you see it all the time. Lifetime warranty blah blah but only if it meets these very specific requirements and you have to pay to ship it back and then pay for the shipping to you with a 24 week turn around....Not the case with their customer service! All I did was let them know it broke and I couldn't provide anything short of my original order number as I had discarded the old umbrella. They simply said they apologize and are sending a new one free of charge.Excellent product and customer service!

On one particular trip to Niagara Falls, I got caught in the nastiest storm ever I've ever experienced (wind speeds of about 50 MPH). Unfortunately, the umbrella couldn't stand the strength of the storm and the umbrella spokes broke. However, I remembered it had a lifetime warranty and decided to try it out.

  Somehow, I manage to have bad luck with umbrellas. The last several that I've bought have lasted me only a handful of uses. One that I bought from Target most notably broke after its first use. Prior to that, I had one that lasted me a decent amount of time...until a windstorm blew it inside out to a point that it was then unusable.The Repel Travel Umbrella has been the main exception to the rule. I've gotten multiple uses out of it in mild rainstorms. It is also the perfect size for me to have an umbrella, but not feel like I'm lugging a sword when I'm using it. It has worked so well that when I mistakenly misplaced it, I felt like I just needed to get a new one. One nice selling point is that the company advertises a lifetime warranty, so that if it ever breaks, they will replace it.

  I cannot argue with the fact that this umbrella is of superb quality (which is the reason for my giving it 2 stars instead of 1), but the size is so small as to render it nearly useless for anyone over 5' tall (I am 5'10"" - hardly a giant). I had the opportunity to try out my new umbrella today in a steady rain with no wind, and after a 15 minute walk home I was wet from the chest down and my very small backpack was drenched. It's like walking with a strawberry daiquiri garnish, but at least those umbrellas come with a delicious alcoholic beverage. I had to walk intentionally slow just to keep the top third of my body dry. If I didn't live in Mexico I would return it, but from here it just wouldn't be worth the hassle. Now I see why the product listing doesn't indicate the size of the arc - just the length and weight. I'll give this to my 4'11"" sister when she comes to visit this month and buy another, larger one with the arc width clearly indicated. EXTREMELY disappointed.

  I decided I was tired of having a rotating inventory of cheap umbrellas, none of which were great. Read about the Repel umbrella on Wirecutter.com review site, and ordered a pair for our family. I love them. They are strong, and open smoothly. The vents mean I won't be struggling with flopping about in windy weather. And, they are attractive. I just ordered two more, and plan to pass along our other (less fantastic) umbrellas. This product was very reasonably priced and is high quality. Highly recommend!

  Wow could not be more disappointed and annoyed. I bought this umbrella specifically for the reviews. Got it to take on a 5 week trip abroad. The first day I used it within minutes it was flipped inside out with a slightest breeze. It kept happening over and over and I‚Äôm looking around and no one else‚Äôs umbrella is doing this. I spent more time uncovered and flipping it back that I ended up throwing it away in the middle of a downpour in London and walking with just the hood of my jacket. Having this umbrella accomplished nothing but adding weight to my bag and taking up space.

    Not worth the price

  When you first open the package, the umbrella feels nice and heavy. The handle feels sturdy, and the spring mechanism is very strong. However, the plastic limb construction is entirely not windproof, and feels rather cheap. The very first time I used this umbrella, it flipped inside out six times just going down one block. After fighting against it for another two blocks, I had to walk the rest of the way with rain soaking through my clothes, because it just wasn't worth the effort and I was already plenty wet from just flipping the umbrella back so many times. I've had umbrellas for less than half the price that felt sturdier when open - this one just wobbles around and feels like it's on the verge of flipping inside out even with very little to no wind. With a price of $23 and it being advertised as windproof, this is honestly a bit ridiculous. After the three times it's rained here in Boston since I bought the umbrella 6 months ago, I'm already afraid to use it.

  No comparison to any other umbrella we have owned.  It's sturdiness, light weight, and compactness when stored, all impressed my wife and me.  Registration for the lifetime warranty was among the easiest I've encountered.  The packaging 'shouted' professional.We live near a mountain range where the wind gusts can be very strong.  We're eager to see how it handles those.  But, based on our initial impressions, we will probably purchase another one from this company.

  As I was struggling in the wind and rain with an inverted umbrella, I decided it was time to get an ""investment"" umbrella, stopping the cycle of just replacing one of the cheap umbrellas that I always seem to buy when the last cheap one gives out. I saw all of the positive reviews on Amazon, so I ordered it. I also trust Wirecutter and usually go with their recommendations.It arrived quickly.  I was disappointed to find a hole in the sleeve when the umbrella arrived. Their customer service reached out to me to make sure everything was ok and sent a replacement the very next day. I was impressed. It seems the lifetime warranty will be worth it.I'm used to mini umbrellas from department stores, so it's an adjustment getting used to this umbrella. It's larger and bulkier than my previous umbrellas, but I think it's going to be better in the end.I was also surprised at the amount of effort required to close it. Again, I'm sure that will get better once I get used to it.On a design note, I'm not a fan of the red accents on the sleeve and umbrella, but that's a minor issue.

  The first umbrella I received was defective which was upsetting. Customer service had already reached out to me to make sure I received the umbrella and that I liked it. I told them about my displeasure concerning the defective umbrella and they immediately sent me a new one. I got it a few days later and this one worked as intended.It's very easy to open and is water resistant which is helpful because a simple shake can make it pretty dry so it's not dripping wet. That makes it easier to throw in the car and not worrying about getting your car all wet and as well going into a building.So far so good. An affordable umbrella that seems well made (assuming you get a functioning one) but the customer service behind the product makes me feel better.

  I've usually gone for the cheap Walmart umbrellas in the past. These never lasted me longer than a few months before one of the bars broke. They also wouldn't hold up against any kind of wind. So I finally decided to get a better umbrella! I haven't had the chance to test this in very terrible weather yet but so far, it's done well! It feels very high quality and super sturdy. I'm not concerned at all about it turning inside out. The fabric is thick and good quality. I love the automatic open/close. The only minor complaint I would have is that the spring to push it close is a bit tough. Makes sense because it's all made of durable material meant to be very wind resistant, that'll all make it hard to push back down. Overall, I'm very pleased with this. Will update this review if I ever run into any issues.

  I like this umbrella, of all the travel umbrellas I have bought, this is the one that is best. It is sturdy, big enough, will not blow over in light wind, light enough to carry with you all day, and of very good quality. There are hundreds to choose from, some saying they are great for traveling, but in fact they are garbage.  This one is the best, trust me.

    BEST umbrella ever! Truly windproof.
  
",5.0,Lunachick,"Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2021","









  
  
    
  I literally own a dozen different umbrellas (I live in Oregon and don't own a car these days - I walk a lot, rain or shine). Of all of them, this the clear winner. I bought this one a year ago, nowadays it is the only one I use (except on the rare occasions I want to use my awesome-looking but very heavy holographic color-changing umbrella for fun).To me, the real stand-out feature is that I can use it on breezy days. There's a section where the fabric overlaps, so if wind blows from the bottom / inside of the umbrella, the vents let it through, without affecting its ability to shed water. On non-windy days, you'd never know the vent (overlapped fabric) was there.It's also quite light and compact, easy to bring along in case of rain, and opens with the press of a button.I added a clip to the loop on the end of the handle and keep it in the side pocket of my backpack, clipped to the top loop of my backpack so it stays in place / won't fall out.After a year of regular use, the umbrella still looks pristine - the ribs in the canopy, the fabric, everything is in great shape. No bends, no tears, no visible damage whatsoever.I'm really impressed with the design and build quality, and highly recommend this umbrella.

  Had to redo this review because of how bad this umbrella is.  It has only been used maybe six times and it's already junk.  It doesn't open all the way and lock into place so you have to hold the umbrella part in place or it just sags down.  Not exactly convenient.  Looks like whatever mechanism that is built into it to close on its own is just defective and that causes several issues.  Save yourself the hassle and pick one up next time you see one in a store for a few bucks.  It will be better and you'll save some money.

  This umbrella was fine in light rains, with little or no wind.  I never had any problems with leaking or rusting, as other users have occasionally reported.  All was well and good until I got caught in a downpour one day.  The wind was gusting and this umbrella didn't make it past the first hard blow.  Luckily for me, there was a trash can very close by for me to deposit what remained of the umbrella.  Also, I was only 3 blocks from home, so I didn't have to walk for long while being soaked to the skin.  Ultimately, this doesn't seem worth the money, so I may just decide to go with a bunch of cheap umbrellas that would cost approximately the same amount for the bunch.

I can only imagine it will leak from there currently, and continue to increase in size.Either:-The rip was already there and I didn't see it when i first got the umbrella-This product developed a rip after careful use and carrying with me for a total of maybe two days.Would not recommend.

  We bought these for our Summer trip to Ireland/England, since both tend to have weather changes throughout the day. We only used them for one day in Ireland. It wasn't extreme weather, but it was a consistent heavy drizzle with occasional gusts. We did see others on our excursion with destroyed umbrellas (though I didn't think the wind was THAT strong). The wind did occasionally invert the outer portion of the canopy, but never did I think the umbrella would fail. The skeleton/frame seemed very strong. Directing the top of the umbrella back in the direction of the wind put it back into place easily.I was really impressed with the Teflon coating, as the canopy did not get soaked through. The droplets stayed pooled on top of the fabric and I was able to easily shake them off.I also like the push button open/close. Easy to use and easy to put the cover back on the closed umbrella. Highly recommend.

You will love it. I plan on buying my daughters both one.

    Not a Fan of This Umbrella
  
",1.0,phxmary,"Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  This umbrella came packaged fine & on time. I dislike this umbrella completely. The first thing I noticed was how heavy it is. I thought I had read it was just over 1lb, but feels much heavier. Now as far as opening, there is an arrow pointing up for open on the handle and it was fairly tuff to push, but doable. Once the umbrella shoots open, the top/canopy of the umbrella seems very nice, the length of the umbrella fully extended is way too short. I compared the extended umbrella to 2 others I have & it is significantly shorter making it awkward to hold. The handle/grip is made of a nice slip free rubber like material, but it as too small to feel comfortable holding considering the weight of the umbrella. To close the umbrella, you push the (difficult to push) arrow down button & the umbrella sort of slams shut. Then you have to push it together to make compact. Pushing it together requires some muscle, that‚Äôs for sure. Lastly the tiny nylon case that is almost impossible to get the closed umbrella into, took several minutes to get back into the case. All in all, this purchase was a total fail despite many good reviews I read prior to my purchase.

  Water did not soak into the fabric. A few shakes and it was nearly dry.Also the spring loaded folding feature was very very cool and useful. Though, it is better if you lower the umbrella first, as the umbrella folds so quickly and with such force that it leaves a cloud of water droplets where the umbrella once was, that will then fall on whomever is standing underneath.I liked the diameter, even in a bit of a breeze  I was able to keep my knees and higher dry and I'm nearly six feet tall.

  Thought I'd already reviewed this. After carrying ans using it repeatedly through a summer of the worst downpours I've experienced here....You can't do better at the price, and likely not better at all, for what it is. If you genuinely walk regularly in the rain, you already know that smaller umbrellas are an order of magnitude better than large ones at resisting wind, at the cost of lesser coverage. In the city - where I live - the only difference in a good wind-driven rain is a few inches above or below your knees. The only umbrella capable of protecting your feet in the rain is called a ""car.""So the other day, the aberrant big-city wind finally caught my umbrella and turned it inside-out. I said a couple of bad words, and turned it straight into the wind, which folded it back into place. It then continued to function normally as if nothing had happened. I've used it a couple of times since. It didn't even seem to notice having been blown out.This is money as well-spent as I've ever done.

  I purchased this not only because it was the highest rated umbrella (at the time) but because I was tired of my past umbrellas corroding from rust and eventually breaking to the point they were unrepairable. Seeing the materials listed as fiberglass, I had my hopes up this would last me longer than my past umbrellas.Now I live in a notably raining area, one of the cities in the US with the most rain, so I've been frequently using it and it did its job. But after a couple months of usage, I did notice some browning on the inside of the umbrella. I never really bothered to look until recently but it seems there are several bits made of rustable metals. Specifically the screws/rivets that hold the joints together and likely even the springs. So while a good majority of it is indeed fiberglass, there are bits of metal pieces that hold the umbrella together and with enough rust, it'll slowly corrode and likely break apart like my past umbrellas have.Me thinking that it was listed as fiberglass made me think it was rustproof but that wasn't the case and it's my fault for not double checking. This more or less caused me to take less care of it thinking I wouldn't have to worry about drying it off every time I used it. So for anyone who does take interest in buying it, do keep in mind to dry off the umbrella after usage to prolong its life.

  I was excited to try out this umbrella based on its many reviews. However, once I received it, I was not impressed. The shaft of the umbrella was not very long so that meant that if I held this umbrella normally there would not be a lot of space between the top of my head and the top of this umbrella. And who wants to hold an umbrella super close like you're hugging it?Also, the width of the canopy was not great at all. It just barely covered most of my shoulders. Had I used this in actual rain, I'm pretty sure my shoulders and arms and back would've been soaked from lack of coverage.The construction of the umbrella distracted me from examining the quality of the material used. But I will say it didn't strike me as being heavy duty or anything.As I previously stated, overall I wasn't impressed with this product. I have returned it for a refund and a different product by a different brand and seller.

  I keep this one on the driver's side door of my car.  I can open the car door just a small amount then click on the umbrella's button and it quickly snaps to the open position.  Later I can get it the car, leave the umbrella sticking out then click the same button and this umbrella snaps closed.  Seems to be highly wind resistant, compact sized, reasonably priced and a joy to use.  I bought a few more for my wife's car and one to keep around the house.

    Well-Made Travel Umbrella
  
",4.0,Josephus Howard,"Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is a well-made umbrella that is sturdy and should last quite a long time. The supports for this umbrella should be able to withstand the normal usage that most people put their umbrellas through.  I was specifically looking for an umbrella with an push button open/close as they are difficult to find.  This one works very well.  If you have never owned a push button open/close umbrella, then you don't know how much easier life could be for you in the rain.  It's a must-have.Another upside to this umbrella is that it is very compact and easy to tuck away in your vehicle glove box or in a larger purse.  The downside is...it is a small umbrella.  This basically is a single person umbrella that is easy to carry, is very handy, sturdy and holds up better than most.  If the company develops this same umbrella, but one that is slightly larger so that I can cover myself and my wife, I would buy three of them!Overall, I would highly recommend this umbrella, especially for the price.  Just know that you are purchasing a compact travel umbrella that you should be happy with.

  Mine broke almost right away. When pressing the button it won't open all the way and you have to push it up by hand. Then when closing, one arm sticks out and won't bend close. I kept telling myself that something was just caught and once I sat down with it, i could get it working again. When I finally got feed up enough to look at it, I saw a small plastic pin in one of the arms had broken. There is no way for me to fix this. It still works when open (but have to manually open and close it) and it is nice and small/light weight.

  I plunked down my money on this ""wind proof"" umbrella because a trusted review site recommended it. The wind has its way with this umbrella left and right, all too often turning it out. Annoying as that is (and for a wind proof umbrella it's quite annoying) it finally (on a recent bout of 10-mile-an-hour wind) started to come undone. Had it two months and i'm well outside my return window. Still has life left in it, but since its begun its downward slope, methinks entropy will quicken. Such disappoint.

    Best Umbrella I've Ever Owned

  I'll make this review, short, sweet and to the point. This is the best umbrella - travel or otherwise - that I've owned. It literally made the difference between having a miserable time in Europe and a great time during on-off rainy vacation in Italy and Croatia. The big test was climbing Mt. Vesuvius with this umbrella in rain and high winds. It held up like a gem. It takes a extreme wind for it to turn inside out BUT the great thing is that if that happens, you can just face the top of the umbrella into the wind and it rights itself. No struggling or breaking rods. Highly recommend for travel or every day use.

",5.0,Andrew V.,"Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2019","









  
  
    
  There's so much about this umbrella that puts all the other ones I've owned to shame. It's got a durable, quality construction that you feel like you can rely on. The handle is a soft silicon like plastic that helps give a solid grip. The umbrella fabric itself prevents water from pooling and staying on. The easy open function makes it easy to collapse and expand the umbrella. Its compact size is perfect for stuffing into a medium-sized purse or day pack. I bought this umbrella for a trip to Seattle and it proved its value amidst all that rain. It got insanely windy at some point and caused the umbrella to turn inside out. That's usually a death sentence for the standard umbrella, but the fiberglass structure went back to its normal shape without any noticeable issues. Definitely should've invested in a good umbrella sooner.

End caps that hold both layers together are crimped, the frame is stronger and the handle is straight not round Like the Chinese model restricting bigger hands from going through the loop handle.

    Solid Build, but small. Really does a good job at repelling water
  
",4.0,Christopher Dinh,"Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2017","









  
  
    
  Opens and closes with a PURPOSE. Definitely does not feel cheap when pushing that open and close button.That being said, I've used the umbrella once already in fairly heavy rain. The umbrella holds in own in the wind and it does not feel like it'll break anytime soon.One thing that impressed me was the ""repel"" effect the umbrella has to water. rather than catching water as it falls, the rain just seems to bead up and roll off. That means when I close the umbrella and bring it inside theres very little water to shake off.Gone are the days of having a dripping wet umbrella at work, in school, in the car, or at home.Pros:1. Solid build quality of the open/close mechanism2. Repel effect keeps water from latching onto the umbrella after you close it. Dry Homes and cars!3. Windproof enough to handle a fairly heavy wind. although admittedly I have not tested this enough.Cons:1. Low coverage: It's designed for one person and you'll have a hard time trying to fit anyone else under it with you2. Handle is small, I wish travel umbrellas like this one had longer handles. It makes it easier to grip over a long period of time- esp in heavy wind.Would recommend to smaller people, and those that regularly walk the lonely path.Still, as a travel umbrella its a solid umbrella and would def buy it again to keep in the car or my backpack.

  I bought this for the teflon coating, and it does work. While it won't be 100% dry after shaking it off, it will be mostly dry, and it dries out very quickly.It's a fairly standard compact umbrella with auto open and close. It's small when folded up, and a good size when open and in use. I have had issues with it flipping inside out in high wind, like any umbrella, but it was easy enough to flip it back.The end cap on the umbrella has broken on mine, I'm not sure if I dropped it and did that, or if it is just a weakness, but it hasn't caused any problems with the umbrella.If I had one complaint, it would be that the handle is a little short. If they could make it longer it would feel better in the hand.

  I‚Äôve owned a lot of umbrellas in my 70 years. I‚Äôve owned huge golf umbrellas, tiny fit-in-your-pocket umbrellas, put-'em-in-your-car-door umbrellas, and now this guy. This one is car door sized and easy to grab and go. Most of the ones that I haven't left somewhere have ended up broken after many carries but few uses. This one stands out head and dry shoulders above the department stores' usual fare of no-names, or Totes. Although I‚Äôve only had it a few days, the build seems much sturdier, and yet still about as light as, say, a Totes umbrella. The canopy is plenty big and boasts a Teflon finish to shed water both from your head and itself. I paid just a few bucks more than the ones I‚Äôve been throwing away as they became broken tangles of ribs and skin. This one has 9 ribs; the Totes I just trashed because the handle kept separating, had only 6. The self opening and closing mechanism works well and the button is stiff enough to stop accidental movement. If this one doesn‚Äôt hold up, I will update this report; however, the warranty from the seller is great and the product seems solid.

  I have used this umbrella several times since buying it a couple weeks ago--once in a high wind. I like it so much I am placing an order for a second one. It fits nicely in the side pocket of my auto without having to try to slip it back into the sleeve provided. I have yet to find a travel umbrella that will actually fit easily into its sleeve--with this one it is compact enough to fit without the sleeve--it would be nice if someone could come up with a sleeve that actually fits a travel umbrella without a great deal of hassle. I find it to be of high quality and a good size once opened--it provides plenty of coverage. This is a travel umbrella, after all, it is not a golf umbrella--you are not going to fit 2 or 3 people under it. I have owned many travel umbrellas over the years and this is as large as any I have found on the market--larger than most. This earns a five star rating for me.

  I just received this umbrella in time for a spring (rainy??) trip to London. I am quite impressed with the construction. It feels much sturdier than my Victorinox (The Victorinox has only six ribs and leaked like a sieve). The Repel umbrella opens and closes very smoothly, and when it opens you have the feeling that the springs are stout. Nothing wimpy about this umbrella. The size is perfect for travel and the weight reasonable for a quality product. Coming with a lifetime warranty is a real plus. I will post an update if this does not perform to my expectations ... but I have every reason to believe it will be perfect.

",3.0,Joe S.,"Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought this umbrella preparing to move to Bergen, which can be notorious for its heavy amounts of rainfall in Norway. Coupled with wind during storms, it can be pretty intense which is why I wanted an umbrella which could be good for travelling yet sturdy enough to withstand the stormlike conditions in Bergen. I do find it very lightweight and compact, easily fitting into my backpack side pocket without me even realizing it's there, but the biggest issue I have with this product is the fact that it advertises that it's windproof. So I expected it not to turn inside out on me at all, but so far pretty much anytime I use it and a mild gust of wind comes along, the umbrella flips inside out which is in stark contrast to what the product description says it does.I do recommend it for a nice and lightweight compact umbrella hence the 3 stars, but if you're going to be in any sort of wind, you might as well find another umbrella or bring a raincoat. I admit it doesn't ALWAYS flip inside out with wind, but it's done it enough to warrant a 2 star for sturdiness.

  I mean, how could I resist with that headline? Really though, I've owned (verified owner) this Repel since June of 2019 (now December) and can confirm it blows away the Totes umbrella I owned previously. Having a Totes from the late 80s I'd ""borrowed"" from my Dad as my go-to for years lead me to purchase a new Totes last year once it gave out (rusted screws and all). I buy this new Totes and within months (less than a year) it had bent enough to still manage as an umbrella but not well. Used it for a few months more until it, too, gave out. Mind you this is less than a year of use with the Totes. After reading countless Amazon reviews much like the one I am typing now had me sold on giving Repel a shot. Says what it is advertised it does and has been a purchase I certainly share with friends/coworkers when I see their raggedy umbrellas or hear their complaints. Worth it. Well worth it.

  I love how light weight this is, however I haven't noticed that it's any more water-repellant than any other umbrella that I've ever used. Where this really loses points, however, is that the very first time I used it, the wind blew the umbrella inside out and it immediately collapsed. Not even gale-force winds, just a quick, normal surge of wind. Seems like we've forfeited structural integrity in order to keep it light weight, but it's not worth it if the umbrella can't even make it 5 minutes.

  Nicely built. The metal shaft is black however, not chrome. Ribs have composite plastic components as well as metal. Easy to hold grip. Powerful spring to fully open and partially close. A little smaller profile in ""diameter"" and height than I expected when I first opened it, but it makes it easy to negotiate into and out of a vehicle with the smaller canopy during a downpour (disclaimer: downpour in Southern California). Overall, this is a quality built, lightweight umbrella. Comes with easy on / easy off cover. My last umbrella was nearly 30 years old, and I'm guessing I paid $10 or $12 for it, so the Repel at $24 seems like a good value. I always open mine indoors and let it dry before stowing, so we'll see how it lasts.

  So this is a short term review, I haven't had this umbrella long enough to really beat it up and put it through its paces. However I got it for free in exchange for my promise to review it. So you kind of have to get that review out there if you want to hold up your end of the deal. If you want shoot me a message and ill update you on how it goes and if i get that ill shoot back here and update this whole thing. but generally you gotta remind me or im not gonna. Unless of course it turns out really bad then I get pissed and dig this up.So here is my initial use impression.  Its a good compact umbrella. They spent a little time on the canopy part. I took a picture of the ribs inside and you can see a lot of moving parts as well as springs I am not used to seeing in an umbrella. I whipped this thing around to ""blow it out"" and you can tell that the outer sections of the ribs are flexible plastic so you can blow it out and pop it back. Looks like you can do that several times without incident.However since this is the initial impression I will mention that I would prefer a more solid feel on the shaft of the umbrella. Also a snappier spring.  There is nothing wrong with it as it is, I think, but it didn't instill confidence when i opened it.  The canopy did, but the collapsing shaft and spring action didn't strike me as the same philosophy as the time spent on the canopy.Time will tell.EDITI feel bad about my comment about the shaft feel. I have picked up a second umbrella today and when opening it I felt that it was a more solid feel upon opening.  so i picked this umbrella back up and it feels the same as the second one.  So ill retract that comment and say that the shaft felt perfectly acceptable to me upon further consideration.

  The lifetime warranty is what sold me on this umbrella. There are several other features that I really like about this over other umbrellas.  There is a Teflon coating on the canopy part which makes water just run off. Another feature of this is that it makes putting the sleve/cover on easier than other umbrellas. The shaft of the umbrella is a strong hexagon shape instead of the traditional round shafts, the additional strength is great for windy days.

  After my old umbrella was destroyed by gust of wind, I was prompted to search for a new umbrella.  I searched on Amazon, and the first thing that appeared on the search result was Repel Easy Touch Umbrella. The price of roughly $25 was an instant turn off.  The idea of paying more than $15 for an umbrella was absurd!  However, the features of having ""Dupont Teflon technology"", ""9 reinforced fiberglass ribs"", and ""Auto open/close"" made me reconsider.When my package had arrived, I needed to test this umbrella.  ""What makes this so good?"" I wondered to myself.  I pushed the button and poof, the umbrella sprang opened.  My eyes opened wide.  ""What is this magic?"" I said out loud. I pushed the button once more, and the umbrella closed as promised in the advertisement.  I giggled and my eyes sparked; I had to share this magical contraption with my friends.On the following day, it was expected to rain.  I've never been so excited for rain in my entire life.  I arranged to meet my friends for dinner.  I had to bring this umbrella, and even did my rain dance to ensure it would rain that night.  When I had arrived at the restaurant, I met my friends, including a girl who I have never met before.  However, it wasn't raining.  I was deeply saddened, yet I still carried the umbrella with me - ready for the moment. After filling out bellies, we proceeded to the exit.  Outside, it was raining...no... it was pouring cats and dogs.  I had the biggest grin on my face, and I stood up straight and proudly push the button.  The umbrella sprang to life, everyone looked up in amazement.  I have never felt more admired than I ever had before.

The customer service was great, and I'm looking forward to using the new product as winter is approaching.I used (or attempted to) this umbrella for the first time two days ago.  As the saying goes, I was ""left high and dry"" (actually wet) as after retracting the umbrella once, it no longer would work.  In trying to open it again, the shaft would extend, but nothing would open.  Tried to retract again, and it no longer worked.

  This is the second time ordering from this vendor. First time the waterproofing came off within one week, the inside rusted, and the joint pins came out. My friend who also bought this umbrella had the pins fall out of the umbrella joints too. I was told that that was a manufacturing error and a bunch were recalled. This is time, the joint came broken and the umbrella won't close. I'm not sure if this is a quality control error or if I am just unlucky. I'd just like to hear what the vendor has to say.

  I bought 4 different colors: black, the one one with the clear blue sky on the inside, yellow, and pink.  A rib on the clear blue sky one broke on the 2nd use.  The yellow one was always hard to collapse to begin with, and on the 3rd use, after putting up a little fight, something broke and no longer opens nor collapse.  Hopefully the remaining 2 will last longer than these two.

  I have benkii before(less1 year) but i lost it :(this is the replacement i chose since it has lifetime warranty without needing to send the umbrella itself back (no need to ship the item if broken)and I expect no less on that promise :)pros: -feels more durable than other  small umbrella, you can notice it by the weight itself and the sturdiness of the main steel -teflon coated so it will dry very fast on rain -ribs feels like bendable durable material so it will survive sudden winds -very handy, fits on small bag -very classy look -lifetime warranty without needing to ship the item back!! (if it broke within a  year i might try this, with screen shot and video record)cons: -i thought the fabric would be a lot thicker since its teflon coated, not an issue though :) -the spring when opening is not super strong but its my preference only, i like it to be more stronger faster opennote: the cons is base on my preference because i have benkii before and as of  now my bag is small so I chose the top umbrella which i think this is :D kudos to the repel team!from 5stars Im gonna make it 2 for now(edit/ update March2019)after 1 year of usage, the umbrella some wire snapped and rendered the umbrella almost lifeless, it can still be opened and close though some of the ribs of it is puncturing the teflon, will now contact them for how to have some warranty? or advice regarding thisedit/April updated rating,I sent an image to repel representative, and said they'll send me new umbrella without having this one send to them back (amazing warranty), it was sent on my US address just within the week of inquiry, and after a month I shipped it to my original locaiton, I have now the new umbrella, its really new, the smell the texture,thanks repel

  The umbrella feels sturdy. Haven't experienced any significant wind gust to test the tolerance of the umbrella. The only negative about the umbrella is the rust that is starting to develop around the aluminum rib cages.2/11/17 - Tested the umbrella under strong wind conditions and the umbrella held up extremely well. The umbrella did flip over once, however, no damage to the aluminum frame. Purchased another umbrella today as a gift.1/6/17Edit - upgraded item from 3 stars to 5 stars. Rebecca from customer service reached out to me in regards to the defective product after the warranty had expired. 2 options: replacement or refund. This is my go to umbrella so a replacement was the only alternative. As an added bonus, I get to keep my original umbrella.Thank you Upper Echelon Products!

",2.0,Amanda H,"Reviewed in the United States August 18, 2016","









  
  
    
  The auto pop out works like a charm, but it is SO hard to close! The button only collapses the umbrella (watch out, you'll probably spray people with the sudden movement), and you have to use a very firm hand at the top of the umbrella (thus getting your hand wet) to jam it back into its original position. Not the best design. The customer service was extremely kind and gave me a partial refund, but ultimately the problem still exists even after I opened & closed it a few more times to loosen it up as they recommended. After a couple of months it's still pretty tough to close. Especially annoying when you're running into the subway and there's a huge stream of people behind you! I also found the handle to be quite wobbly. One aspect I did like, though, was how the water rolled off the umbrella easily & the material dried quickly once you were indoors.Update March 2017: They have really good customer service and sent a new umbrella & also gave me a refund. However, I found that the new product still had exactly the same problems (mainly that it was so difficult to close), and therefore don't think my review changes. Great customer service though.

  This is an exceptional umbrella! I have finally found the perfect one! I needed an umbrella that not only provided protection from the rain, but that could also withstand heavy winds. I have already put the Repel Windproof to the test three different times and it exceeded my expectations. I have gone through so many umbrellas from top name brands that fall apart in even the mildest of winds, but the Repel umbrella was tough through it all and well worth the price. I will be buying more, as it is the best umbrella I‚Äôve used. Highly recommend!

  So some back story... I had a couple cheap umbrellas lying around the house. I had one from over 10 years ago, worked good enough. However a few months ago the wind was so strong it broke the shaft in half between the handle and the top part. Was not happy, but had another cheap umbrella I bought in Amsterdam for 5 euros. The wind over there broke the support beams on the side, but worked enough to get around. About a week ago it finally gave out completely so I did what any person does these days, look online for reviews. After a little bit of research, this umbrella was the winner. People say it will survive heavy winds and is portable enough to carry around in my backpack. Also the piece of mind of a lifetime guarantee sold me on the product.Got the umbrella a couple days ago and got a friendly message from the support team making sure I received the product as well as checking to make sure I am completely happy with the product. Definitely nice to see a company care about their products.Woke up this morning to rain outside. It wasn't windy, but raining enough to give this umbrella a test drive. I walked outside for around 20 minutes this morning in the rain and here's what I noticed:Completely dry after walking aroundWith a slight breeze, I didn't notice any issuesWhen going inside I did a quick spin of the umbrella and the canopy appears mostly dry except for a little condensation of portion that is folded over, which surprised me how much the material repels the waterOverall so far I am impressed. :-)

  So it's July in Tennessee. The weather app on my phone says 'no rain' so I walk out of the house with no raincoat or umbrella. I commute by train and foot - about a mile each way. Of course, at 4 o'clock when it's about time to leave the sky will open up. The last time this happened I had my old umbrella at my desk and headed off home. About 1/3 of the walk through my walk it started to rain. Pulled the 'old' umbrella out of the bag and opened it. First gust of wind turned it inside out. I was soaked. My mission was to find a reliable umbrella.Enter the Travel Umbrella from Upper Echelon. At a price I thought was fair but not cheap, I ordered it directly and received it quickly. On first use, it is sturdy and didn't flip inside out at the first gust of wind. It has an automatic open and close (I really like the auto close). It came with a nylon carry bag, great for keeping the interior of my tote bag dry. It's large enough for 2 people but not too big for one. It's lightweight, with a small collapsed size. Black is the only color available. It repels the water really well.I still have my old umbrella sitting under my desk (just in case) but the new umbrella is so small and light that it stays permanently in my commuter tote so I'll have it for the pop up showers I've come to expect.

  After the 6th use, it would not consistently stay locked when stowed.  It took some effort to get the lock to engage.  Last weekend, when deploying the umbrella, the tension string inside the umbrella simply broke and I could no longer fold the umbrella.  Pretty much junk in the final analysis.  The price for this relative to the quality can't even begin to be justified.

  I recently purchased one of these umbrellas after doing some research regarding what umbrella was best for wind and rain. The reviews assured me that this umbrella would withstand both.On my very first use, the umbrella broke by flipping inside out at the first gust of wind, approximately 100 feet from my apartment. While I was able to turn it back to its proper shape, I was very disappointed in its immediate failure after claims of ‚Äúwind-resistance‚Äù and struggled to keep it facing the correct direction the rest of my 20-minute outdoor walk.  I have used it two more times and have had the exact same problem with it flipping inside out, with the last time breaking one of the prongs. I have shown up to work soaking wet because it continues to fail to hold its shape. I am extremely displeased with your product and will not be purchasing again and am on the market for an actual wind-resistant, water-resistant umbrella.

  I haven't actually opened the umbrella or used it yet so once I use it I will update this review.  I am going on an extended vacation and I wanted an umbrella that would tuck into the side pocket of my messenger bag.  I wanted something light weight.  This is a fairly heavy umbrella for it's size.  It also really isn't a pocket umbrella.  I will still probably bring it with me though.  We'll see how it works with the handbag.Update:  It is very slender and it did fit in the handbag's pocket. The umbrella does appear to be of high quality.  Since I am taking it on vacation, I've decided to keep it in a tote bag while on the trip.The three stars are strictly, because I still haven't used it yet. Also, it isn't the seller fault that I was looking for something shorter. I will update this review when I go on vacation in a month.Second Update: It is a sturdy umbrella.  I took it on vacation to the UK and Ireland.  I carried it in my tote bag pocket and it fit well there.  Iupgraded the umbrella to a four, because of one very cool feature.  Like many automatic umbrellas, it has an up button.  However, this umbrella has a down button, as well, that collapses the umbrella at a touch.  Recently, I wrecked an umbrella.  I tried to close it as I was getting into a car. The wind blew the door on it and it was toast.  The down button means that the canopy collapses quickly.  You still have to push the umbrella down to the handle, but it means that the umbrella shuts quickly when you are entering a car or bus.  I have acrylic finger nails. Managing to push any kind of button is darned near impossible, yet I could open and close this umbrella easily.  Also, the canopy is small and that is a good thing.  We were walking through crowds on the street.  A large canopy would have gotten in the way.  This was just the right size.  It is good value for the money.

  It was windy the day I was finally able to use the umbrella, so it was impressive to see it didn't fold the opposite direction. Also impressive, was it didn't hold onto water like most umbrellas do. Realizing this is only a travel umbrella (which I had gotten through a lightning deal, so I can't really complain) was that I wish it was a bit larger. It sufficed, however, for one person, and 2 smaller humans (my 9 yo nieces who look more like 5/6 due to their height/size (preemies)).

    Upper Echelon *really* needs to deal with the rust problems, and the metal ribs breaking at the edge
  
",2.0,Martin A.,"Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2018","









  
  
    
  Firstly, I am writing this review as I was prepared to order another Repel umbrella after I was refunded for the first when it broke - thanks to the speedy customer service (this review is not directed at you) Apparently Echelon cannot ship a replacement outside the U.S, although they refund the item cost + international s&h making it the exact amount paid - which is really quite strange. It would certainly be less of a loss to them to replace the product as opposed to reimbursing. But kudos for this anyway.In any case, my umbrella quickly developed issues in the form of the metal pins holding the canopy in place coming off whenever there is above-average wind activity, as well as the umbrella shaft itself becoming bent when stronger winds are indeed occurring (had to be manually bent back into shape in order to open+close it). That was one of the issues, and it happened approx. 1.5 months after it was bought.A second issue was the rust. Yes, an umbrella which apparantly cannot withstand rain or moisture. I first thought this was a one-off issue, but then made a search for ""rust"" in the existing Amazon reviews - and to my surprise a great many people have experienced this(!), and it is explained each and every time as ""it sounds like you may have received a defective unit"", which is not the explanation I wanted to hear.Sorry, this is a serious design flaw and the only way to get this fixed - and enjoy the good aspects of this product - is to deal with it, and the only way to get their attention is to post critical reviews (especially considering the fact that there are so many 5-star reviews which cannot have been left after the product has been used over, say, 6 months to a year.I *really hope* these quality issues are taken to heart and addressed; In which case I will certainly order another umbrella from them.

  What a blessing this baby has been. It's been raining in Louisiana non-stop; we are actually flooding here right now. I couldn't have gotten this at a better time. The quality of this umbrella is really nice. It is really compact and small, so it fits easily into my purse or my work bag. Even though it is compact when closed, it opens up to a really good size. It comes with a cover to put it in. This allows less dripping from the umbrella itself; which can get all over our cars and cause it to smell. However, with that being said, this umbrella is made from a certain type of Teflon, that repels the waters and allows for pretty close to immediate drying. It's basically a Rain-X umbrella, so to speak. I used it yesterday and it really did dry up that quick.The umbrella actually has a 9 rib construction, unlike the normal 6 or 8 ribs. This means that it is able to withstand higher wind gusts without flipping inside out. It has an easy open and close function, you just press the button on the handle and voila. There is a wrist strap for easy carrying when you are not using it. I tried to take a picture of it yesterday, but it was really humid and gross outside from the rain, so my picture is a little foggy. Overall, this is a really nice quality and solidly built umbrella. I see this lasting a really long time and hey, if it doesn't I read in the instructions that there is a lifetime replacement guarantee. Cannot beat that.--update-- I took a picture of it after coming in from a huge rain storm. Look how there is barely any water on it. It definitely repels the water like I've never seen. I also want to add that I have never used an umbrella that opened up so easily. I'm definitely glad to have this!!

  Unlike many folding umbrellas, this one uses a pushbutton to open, and the same button to collapse the top.  You still have to compress the top back down toward the handle to stow the umbrella (and reset the spring mechanism), but the fact that the top part is gathered back toward the center part is helpful when getting into a car in the rain.Just to be clear, the mechanism works like this:  When the umbrella is fully stowed, you first unwrap the fabrix strap that holds it together, then push the button.  This causes the center pole to extend and the canopy to pop open into its final position.  The second time you push the button, the canopy will draw back to the center.  The telescoping center pole still needs to be pressed down toward the handle to fully stow the umbrella.  And pushing the button only works once to open and once to collapse the canopy -- you can't keep opening and closing it.  The mechanism has to be cocked after each use.As far as its umbrella characteristics, it works fine and is an adequate size comparable to similar folding umbrellas.  But the dual-action mechanism makes it nicer to use when going back inside or into a car when it's raining.
