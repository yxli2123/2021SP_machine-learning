  I tested the ph of Icelandic water. The result is same as my house tap water, around ph 7. But the advertisements tell us the ph is 8.4. At the same time, I also tested the ph of Avian, the color is even darker than Icelandic’s and they only mark the ph 7.2

  Initially I was hesitant about this product and actually did not initially rate it well BUT I gave it a second chance and the very next day I drank more of this water than I ever have any other. I have now drank this water for an entire week and just feel amazing.  The taste is pure and neutral- you don't taste anything, it's water.  I used to drink evian and Fiji on the regular, but I have drank other high-pH waters for many years BUT none of them were as easy to drink and tasted as neutral as this water. I've now also subscribed to this deliver because when I worked out the current price, it came out to only $1.19 per bottle U.S. dollars which is INSANE for water this good and high-quality. Normally I pay $2.00-2.50 for other brands in the 1 liter size category in this pH category of spring water as well. I gave it a chance and I drink way more water now than I have which was what I really needed to do for my health. (Oh and unlike some reviews you see on Amazon now, this is NOT paid for/sponsored. I never get paid or approached for any reviews, so this is just me loving this product.)

  This is quality water and very affordable. During my mothers chemo treatment I started buying the PH water in our local stores, then looked on Amazon to see if I could get a better price. I read a lot of the reviews and looked at my cost per oz. and found Icelandic Glacial water. The water has a nice taste and smooth texture, very pleasant to drink cold or at room temp. As I stated above, I started having my 83 yr old mother drink PH water during her rounds of chemo. We can tell a tremendous difference in her stamina, little to no nausea and her hair has thinned but not falling out. She has chemo every 4 wks and comes home with the Neulasta Onpro, so she is having very strong treatments. I am amazed how much this water is making a difference in her skin color, stamina and over all well being. Three variables that have made the difference, Pray, Chemo and the PH balance water.

  As someone who has been to Iceland and was given a tour of the Icelandic Glacial Water facility where they bottle this water, and has seen the source of the water, I can assure you there is no false advertising with them. It is bottled at the source and they keep their facility so clean that we had to be covered from top to bottom before beginning the tour. They make their own bottles and it is directly from the source, so much so that their bottling process is designed so that the water is NEVER exposed to the open air until someone buys a bottle and opens it for the first time. If you shake up a bottle of Dasani and shake up a bottle of Icelandic Glacial Water you'll see and taste the difference.I've been drinking this water for 7-8 years and won't have any other bottled water in my fridge. Not many stores near us sell this water so it is nice to have the option to order it by the case here.

  Ok I know its a bit “exotic” and the marketing will be the first thing someone criticizes. I suffer from a life long gastrointestinal immune disorder. Acidity is a byproduct/problem and admittingly I’m not as disciplined as I should be with my diet. I tried this 8.4ph water as a recommendation and I have to say it helps me a lot. I was so skeptical. When I make coffee I use it. Normally coffee for me is not a great idea, but to beat fatigue I have to go for it. When I do, I brew my own and use this water. Again I’m not one to be a nut about any food, especially since I’ve been told by the best doctors there is no one diet that can “fix” me, but this water helps. I swear by it. I have made it a habit to use this water at least when I first wake up and go to bed. I have seen my usage of proton inhibitors drop from daily to 1-2 times a week and sometimes 0 for 2 or more weeks since I started using this. I believe it is assisting my GI tract with digestion, or at least reducing acidity without aggravating the already overactive nervous system. Evidence for that for me would be simply drinking something more acidic. When I do, an increase in flair ups is guaranteed. I try to balance a slightly acidic meal or liquid with this and well.. I feel better. In addition, this water tastes amazingly clean. Anyone I’ve given it to, without explanation they love it. So for me worth the cost.

    Fantastic water but way too expensive
  
",5.0,BK,"Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2018","









  
  
    
  This is my favorite water but unfortunately it is way over priced here on Amazon. I was able to get a couple of the 1 liter cases of 12 for $14.99 each once but since then it never dips below $28 and is mostly $35 and up. These smaller 500 milliliter 24 count cases are outrageously priced. $35 and change is just way too much. I finally settled on Fiji water at Sam's club that runs $20 a case for 24 of the 16.9 oz. bottles. You an occasionally catch them on sale cheaper than that at Sam's too. Amazon has the Fiji 1.5 liter bottle case of 12 for $23 which is a good deal if you are ok with the large size. But back to Icelandic. It is hands down the best tasting water and it tests out really good on tds and akalinity. Only buy when you can find it reasonably priced and that just doesn't seem to be in Amazon's plans. Look elsewhere for Icelandic unless you just have the $$$ to afford it.

  I ordered 2 cases of the plastic bottles from Amazon. I have always purchased the glass bottles but thought I would try the less expensive plastic bottles. There should be a warning that this product can cause kidney damage if consumed in plastic bottles. This product gave my family the worse back pain ever, we found out that it was our kidney's and to stop drinking the water. After reading in several blogs that the plastic Icelandic uses is one of the worse on the market for plastic Microfiber contamination by the World Health Organization (WHO). I usually purchase 2 cases of 12 glass bottles @ $89 each and never had a problem, but this is unbelievable.  These bottles are killing your customers and the environment.Amazon is only allowing one refund, and will not take the opened or unopened box back. I literally have to waste product and my money.

See the difference in the pic. I think the one on the left, bought from Amazon is a knockoff. The UPC CODE is larger and the writing above is way to the left. Look at the words CARBONNEUTRAL product. There is one line of writing underneath while the bottle on the right the UPC is smaller and the writing above is over the UPC code.

    The Way Water is Supposed to Taste
  
",5.0,Lovetoread,"Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2016","









  
  
    
  I love this water.  It doesn't have a ""soft"" taste but it is also not overly mineral-y.  It just tastes clean and fresh, exactly the way water is supposed to.  I have tried many other brands of premium and non-premium bottled water, including Fiji, Evian, Voss, Volvic, Smart Water, and others, and I like the taste of Icelandic the best.  I also find that I drink more water when I have it on hand.  The slim, square-ish bottle shape allows me to pack more bottles into my refrigerator, but it still fits in the cup holder of my car.

  It’s absolutely tasteless and wonderful. I’m usually a Fiji drinker but I have to admit Fiji tastes like day old spit...I cannot actually verify this claim because I don’t actually know how a bucket of day old spit tastes- this is merely an opinion. What I do know or at least have been told by people smarter than me...which btw you are the average of the 5 people you hang out with the most- that’s why I only associate with rocket scientists... 🧐 but I digress...what I have been told is Fiji is bpa free and contains silica which binds with aluminum and flushes from your body...I digress yet again...this is not a review for Fiji...what I’m trying to say is this water is fabulous and without the $8 coupon I would not know that because it’s priced above my pay grade- therefore if you can afford it I can’t believe you would be disappointed but as for me when these 12 are gone I will return to a bucket of spit aka Fiji and live by the mantra if it tastes good it is not good for you ..unless of course it’s from Iceland.

  First, I do not like the taste of water.  Over the years, all types of health care providers have told me to drink more water.  ""Try the flavored drops"", they said.  I am very sensitive to artificial flavors, colors and chemicals.  All of the drops I tried gave me headaches or worse.  Finally one health care provider suggested I try this particular brand of water.  I was skeptical.  She assured me she did not get kickbacks from the company, nor did she sell the product.  She said in her opinion, it was the best tasting water she had ever had.  Okay.  It's a little pricey.  But I need to drink more water, so I tried it.  It actually tastes better than any water I have ever had.  No bubbles, just water.  I don't know any kind of magical thing about the pH, but they do make mention of the pH of the water being 8.5, I believe.  Don't know enough physiology or whatever to tell you anything about that.  All I know, it's good, I am drinking water like I never have before.  I have this on subscription.  You might want to try it if you have trouble getting water down like you should. Just sayin'.

  Water becomes an essential purchase in our living these days due to lots of pollution. Whether if we are getting quality water becomes a basis question.Through years, I always believe getting filtered water from our sink/refrigerator is the source of good water. However, with minimal research, you will discover depending on the cities you live in, the water filtration system varies, and some undesirable components stay in the water.With the help of subscribing purchase of this Icelandic water, we could enjoy full of natural minerals as a portion of our intake water.The only downside on the package of this brand is the  package, compared to a rounded shape, the squared bottom makes it hard to fit into a cup holder, or for small children to hold them in hands.And the thickness of the bottle makes me believe that each package consumes much plastic materials.Overall, great taste of water, price is acceptable if you consider with a minimal reach, we could all enjoy the natural Icelandic water thanks for amazon subscriptions.

  Excellent quality water! I am a first time user of Ph water myself. I bought this Ph water based on the fact that the source of it comes from an volcanic stream that has natural filtration and is not in contact with outside air which can pollute water. So the only contact it has with outside air is when you open the bottle. It is a bit more expensive the others, but a company that makes there people wear protective scrubs, gloves and given the source of the water, I’ll be a buyer of their water because of the care and quality in which they handle something so precious and important that we are putting into our bodies.

  I really like the very clean pure taste!  I truly believe I feel that it helps reduce inflammation with my esophagus (I have a condition) when I drink this over regular filtered water.  I got CORE water before I got this and they are about the same as far as I can tell, CORE is a little cheeper to buy, taste is the same and PH level is about the same.  I will most likely continue to buy both and alternate each day and I get the largest size for both 1.3L and 1.5L.  I read all of the reviews on both and there were some criticisms about the PH level both claim.  So when I researched taking PH level of water, you will NOT get an accurate reading using litmus paper testers which is what most people seam to be using.  I wouldn't go by those reviews.  I feel much better drinking this water knowing how clean and pure they are and will not drink any other bottled water anymore. I will start to mix filtered water with this water though, maybe a 1:3 ratio, to save money and still get the benefits.

  I am a water junkie and if my advice counts for anything, this is one of the best tasting waters I have ever had. Its so clear and smooth its unbelievable. Now I talk about water like its a cocktail or can of soda, and maybe water is water. However this water really is a cut above the rest. And in its category, its cheaper than some other brands I have tried. If you are looking for a nice quality bottled water that will be refreshing as jumping in the pool on a summers day, this maybe for you. I have trouble keeping other peoples hands off of these in my home.

  Earlier this year I was in Iceland for about 10 days. I fell in love with their pure, clean water. I was happy to find out that I could buy this water back home in the US. I have been buying the Icelandic water since my return from Iceland in February of this year. The PH is 8.4 which is a little higher on the alkaline level which I like.

  I didn’t know what to expect when I got these. I drink regular purified water all the time and I’m just so tired of that iron-ish taste. So I thought I’d try these. At first I was like well it just tastes like water. Had a little after taste. Put one in the freezer for like 30 mins and then I tasted the difference. It’s crisp and clean. NOTHING like Aquafina, Dasani or any old store brand purified water. Now it’s only day one so let’s see how it goes. Definitely try it cold. And for around a buck 25 per bottle I think it’s ok.

  This type of water is so sexy. There's only a few brands I trust and sofar I like the balance and PH of this water the best - not too high, not too low, and from what I've heard it's handled with care. With this, you get a balanced PH level that isn't too high to ruin your stomach or fatigue you at all, like those cheaper higher PH brands; it's right in the 7.0 to 8.4 range which is great. The water is allegedly freshly taken from some iceland glaciers and has a very nice quality to it. It might just be water but if I were to buy any bottled water, then I want to know where it's coming from, and know I can rely on drinking it. There have been cheap brands where it tasted way too acidic and almost contaminated or recycled to me, it's good to know you can find a quality source that takes it seriously.

  Awesome water, very clean and pure tasting. I bought it because I was looking for a high quality above average pH water to be a candidate for a subscribe and save to make my daily go to water. The price was excellent when I started a few months ago and remained steady, but it has fluctuated as much as $10 a case for the 1 liter bottles. I can understand fluctuations of a few dollars, but $10 is a bit much when I'm ordering between 3 and 4 cases. One other note, the box these come in is extremely fragile and often bursts at the seams during shipping, I assume the strength is weakened from possibly too much recycled material.

  This water is wonderful in all regards.  However, I received a box that was supposed to contain 12 bottles, but it had only 11.  The curious thing is that the box seems properly glued and sealed, with no sign of having been opened or tampered with.  And there were no traces of a possible spill or damage that could explain a missing bottle.  Thus, I must assume that, instead of a baker's dozen, I simply got an Icelandic dozen, íslenskur tugi...

  To understand a bottle of water it can be helpful to try it at room temperature first and then refrigerated later. I say this because I tried this water at room temp multiple times and while it was interesting, it has a subtle fullness to the flavor that when I compared it to Fiji I felt more drawn to Fiji, but then I tried Icelandic in it's chilled form and the difference was clear. This is the caviar of waters.If you have a suggestion for a better bottled water, please comment on this review and share the Intel.

  I really do enjoy the taste of this water over other fancy brands.  Crisp and a fine ending taste (such a term ?)  Water from some expensive filters can do the same but there is always something missing.  Like the thought of drinking water from glaciers in iceland. Viking water.  Yes, the water is slightly ""contaminated"".  It has a little nitrate.  But it tastes darn good.  The only complaint is the cost.  In the market at times much cheaper. Even the company sells it below Amazon.  1.5 litre doesn't stand up in the fridge.  So I wait and then I pounce on a sale.  Haven't tried all the rest.

  I have a huge problem with remembering to drink enough water. Having a fridge full of these beauties makes me not only remember to drink water, but I enjoy it so much more. This water tastes fantastic. I have tried a wide variety of alkaline bottled waters, and this one tastes the best to me. It tastes like you're drinking it out of a glacial ice luge. The faceted bottle evokes refreshing images of crystal-clear ice, making it not only aesthetically stunning, but also thirst-inducing. I only wish it were less expensive, since I often switch to a different, more cost-effective alkaline water. I'd rather just drink Icelandic Glacial.

  If you love great tasting water you are going to love this water. I describe it as going to a mountain top and having the freshest water you have ever had. It taste refreshing cold right out the fridge and surprisingly just as great at room temperature. Side note I've order different sizes none of them fit in car cup holder. That's seriously my only complaint.

  The delivery was on time as promised.  The water tastes great. But I had a problem.  This was a package that was supposed to contain 12 counts of 1.5 liter bottled water.  But there was only 11 counts  inside the carton when I opened it.  There was no damage to either cardboard cartons (the original package box from Icelandic and the outside packing box (maybe) from Amazon ? ).  Both boxes were in perfect condition.  So how could 1 Bottle be missing ?  For this reason, I would not order this item again.

I had two degreed and veteran Chemists independent test a bottle on different days.  The pH was 8.73 and 8.86 respectively.  The machine's tolerance is +\- 0.1.  So the results are consistent and basically within the machine's digital tolerance.No insult intended but Litmus paper is more a go no-go for acidic or basic and store bought tests simply are not that accurate and certainly can in no way match professional results on state of the art equipment.I enjoy the taste of the water but will likely not buy more due to the high cost.

But it was too heavy for me to move and I had to get a neighbor to help me because it was so heavy and the case of water inside was broken open.

  Simply, the cleanest, naturally tasting water I've ever had.  I have never trusted any tap water since I was a boy.  I've never found a bottled water that didn't taste ""treated"" or ""metallic""....or, just not close to that natural, tasteless water that, I remember when I was a boy.  (we had well water not, town).  Again, Icelandic Glacial is the closest thing to the ""real"" thing in regards to ""bottled water"".

  We are hooked in this water and the quality is second to none. We always watch for sales and order large quantities when on sale as it can get expensive, especially for those on a lower budget. If you do find it in a store ask about ordering in bulk and the store will likely give you a discount if you order several cases.

If high Alkalinity water is what you want and you can not afford an alkaline water machine then maybe you can justify the high price of the Evamor water.As far as my preference, Fiji tastes the best out of this group but Evian, which I did not test, I think tastes the best!

  You would think that all water is the same, but I recently learned that this is untrue. This water is amazing - it doesn't taste like any other water I've ever had, and I'm so glad that I can order it here in the US. I first had some in Iceland, and thought that I'd never see it again unless I went back, but then I saw the actors drinking it on the Big Bang Theory and decided to look it up on amazon - so happy!

  I bought it because my tap water taste like sulfur. This, to me, taste like my tap water. However, my employees like it so it did not go to waste.Many European countries have rejected water fluoridation in general. This includes: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Scotland, Iceland, and Italy. (hope this helps with the fluoride questions)

  This was was okay. I bought a case of it and had my two sons and my husband try it and nobody was knocked dead over the flavor, like some of the reviews.  It was just water to them.  I like the taste, but it would never be worth the money.  I like Essentia better, for taste and price combined.  I can had a case of 1.5 qt. size delivered, free ship with prime for $20.00.  SO it's like $2.00 a bottle. (the Essentia,) and this was twice the money.

",5.0,SamE,"Reviewed in the United States May 22, 2015","









  
  
    
  First off let me say this Iceland Glacier is very good water. I had been using FIJI water for a couple months, but sometimes noticed that is has a strong ""plastic"" taste depending on which bottle size I get. I also didn't like the fact that Fiji water is so secretive about what all in in there, as they only list a few of the mineral content. While Icelandic has a PDF on their site from the NSF that is a full water analysis report. Icelandic is also a higher pH level.I had purchased Icelandic from a local store and liked it, so I decided to order the 1L twelve count from Amazon.When it was delivered, I opened the box, but there was a black sticky tar like substance on the bottles.I contacted Amazon for a replacement, but it was out of stock. But Amazon was still able to resolve this by issuing a credit.Because of that black liquid on the bottles, I'm not sure if I'll order it again once Amazon has it back in stock, or have to start buying it again from my local store.

  The best water I ever had was at a water fountain in Iceland. This product just does not come even close. It is not a bad taste but just not what I was expecting. A Natural Springs bottled water sold at DollarTree for $1.00 and contains 128 ounces tastes as good. I am glad I could compare and most likely will not purchase this product again. I can not wait to return to Iceland and sample some of that really good tasting water.

  I enjoy drinking this water very much as I hate the taste of tap water. I order it by the case and drink it through slowly(it's expensive) but I know that I am getting pure water, clean and clear. In fact it is so clean you may think something is off about the taste but that is because we have been conditioned to think the water we drink everyday is perfectly fine when it's not as clean as it can be. I want the best from my water and IG delivers.

  Let me start by saying I was once a water skeptic- I am on an artisan well and have good water, and was a believer that ""water is water"" and why would anyone PAY to buy it?  Well let me say, this particular water has changed my mind and I am a believer.  I don't know if it is the high PH or the fact that it is glacial water- this is, hands down, the best water I have ever tasted.  It has a clean, crisp finish, and I just simply love it.  I got hooked on this because my husband who is a truck driver came home raving about it- he bought it on a whim at a truck stop- and once I tried it, I just had to order it!  If you are of the belief that all water is the same, TRY THIS ONE.  You will not be disappointed and you will probably be just as amazed as I was!  Love it, love it, LOVE it!

    Not 8.4, still basic pH
  
",5.0,Steve C,"Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2016","









  
  
    
  I tested the pH and it's a little lower than advertised, probably due to contamination from the plastic after storing it for too long. It's more like 7.8, but it's still basic. A lot of food is too acidic these days, and having an acidic body pH can make you unhealthy and more likely to develop cancer. This would be a good thing to drink if you want to neutralize your body. They might send you a similar generic brand for the water, but it's probably the same thing either way. Highly recommended as far as bottled water goes.

  It's good water. That's all I can say about it...but the bottle is really special.I hate the new low-plastic, recycle-focused bottles that are being made. They squish in your hand and water can come flying out, or they get pushed out of shape in their “pack” and won’t stand up with good balance. The “pack” is usually a thin piece of cardboard wrapped by a piece of plastic at least the same thickness as the bottle. Many times, it’s just the plastic wrapped around the bottles –no cardboard. What makes the thin plastic more recyclable than the thicker bottles? Nothing! It’s just a way of saving the manufacturer money while earning Green Stamps (you’d have to be old to get that joke) from the public.Anyway, this bottle is much thicker, it’s interesting to look at, and its packed in a cardboard box that you can recycle. Even better, the bottom of the bottle is square. That shape makes it more stable. You’re less likely to knock it over if you’re a klutz…like me. This particular sized bottle has more than enough water and is less top-heavy than the next size up by the same company. See “klutz” mentioned above and you’ll understand how that would be significant.I refill the empty bottle from the tap…for months. Seriously. Now what could be more recyclable than that? It’s square shape is better than a round water bottle out of aluminum or plastic. It’s almost klutz-proof.

  Every branded water uses words like crisp and clean, but Icelandic Glacial is the only one I've tasted that genuinely has an inherent crispness. It's hard to explain what that means, though I might describe it as having a hard-edge profile in diametric opposition to Fiji's soft and smooth profile. It's become one of my favorites.I was glad to find Icelandic Glacial on Amazon after buying it a couple times elsewhere online. Since I buy a large share, if not most, of my consumables here it's a convenient one stop shop. Had Amazon finally added Icelandic Glacial to Subscribe & Save, I wondered...Nope. Not only no S&S option, but it's actually gone missing entirely. Sign up for an email reminder, that's it, outta luck.C'mon Amazon, bring back Icelandic Glacial. Pretty please? Kthxbai.

  I dislike the taste of tap water in my city, so much so that I add some type of flavor to it to get it down.  My cats will not drink the tap water, so we have to purchase filtered water for them.  The tap water will leave a stain in their bowl after it evaporates.  We replaced the entire water intake pipes including the main line and this did nothing to improve the water quality.  We drank a bottle of Icelandic water in the Austin airport lounge and seriously enjoyed its tastes.  I usually drink inexpensive spring water to avoid drinking city water but decided to treat myself to a case of Icelandic water, which so far I have not found in the Atlanta markets. Icelandic water tastes so good, that I stopped adding any flavors to a glass of water.  I found myself easily drinking more water and giving up fruit and soda drinks.  The increased hydration has greatly reduced stomach and muscle cramps, improved skin appearance and eliminated headaches.  In comparison to the money I spent in Rx and OTC medicines each month, buying Icelandic each month is less expensive.  Only complaint is that it can not be ordered on Subscribe and Save.

  First, I would like to state that I majored in chemistry and now I teach Advanced Chemistry.Now, let me tell you about this pH.  The pH of this water when tested with a VERNIER pH Probe was 6.2-6.5.  This is actually considered acidic, not basic (alkaline). Also, since the pH scale is logarithmic, that means that this water is approximately 100 times more acidic than advertised.I purchased this water at the recommendation of my doctor to help with pregnancy induced heart burn.  I also tested the pH of my tap water with the same probe.  That tap water tested at 7.3, which would be better than this overpriced water for my heartburn!Before a representative posing as a customer states that the probe is faulty or not designed to measure the pH of water but instead the pH of urine or saliva, which I have seen suspiciously posted in regards to the use of pH strips on other rebuttal posts....don't.  Just don't.  This product should be sued for false or misleading advertisement.  At the very least, you need to take off the pH of 8.4 on the label and advertisements.

We were skeptical. HOWEVER, they are right, this water tastes amazing!I buy it by the case when it goes on sale at our local store.  I have done two “tests” with this water. We have a friend who works in the water business. I served him this water w/o telling him—just gave him a glass when he was over. After drinking it, he commented on how good it was. Wanted to know if it was from our well.Then, just last week we had new friends over. She only drinks water. I have her a glass of this (not telling her anything about the water). She asked for a second glass and commented on how great the water tasted! This water is delicious. I put a bottle in the freezer for 1-2 hours to get it cold. And to have ice floating around.

The flavor is clean with no funny aftertaste. That said, this costs me $2.19/bottle at the grocery store and Amazon is selling it for $5.41/bottle. Total ripoff.  If the price were comparable to my grocery store, I would subscribe for life. Until that happens, I'll keep buying it at the grocery store.

    Pretty Good Icelandic Water
  
",4.0,,"Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2017","









  
  
    
  This Icelandic Glacial water tastes pretty good. I can't say it's anything extraordinary, but it's tasty enough. I recently discovered Smart Distilled Water, which resulted in the equivalent of what the breathtaking night sky in Maine did to this bored Jersey girl. Smart Water has tasty electrolytes in it, and I was completely taken aback by its full flavor.So now other brands of water seems even more average to me, just like the polluted Jersey sky. Regardless, I would buy this pack of water again. I can taste a distinct difference from a bottle of Poland Spring water, but I can't describe it or distinguish which one is superior. You know, since most peopls have tried Poland Spring.By the way.. I finally DID see a gorgeous sunset the last rime I was hospitalized. The colors were brilliant and it was amazing. I guess Jersey ain't all that bad.... it's your mentality that really matters no matter where you go.So with that in mind, close your eyes and sip this refreshing water .. imagine that you're in Iceland enjoying the finest beverage known to mankind and you'll like this water just fine. ♡

",1.0,Allen,"Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2017","









  
  
    
  Taste-wise, the water is actually decent.The reason I'm giving this 1 star is because the product description is misleading. The bottle clearly states that the pH of the water is 8.4. I tested the pH of several bottles and to my surprise, the pH is actually somewhere in the ballpark of 5, which means this water is not slightly alkaline as advertised but is in fact acidic.

  I am so sick of the lies that companies tell.  I just received eight bottles of Icelandic water.  The Icelandic water tastes awful, which is why I decided to test the pH. The pH came back about 4.5 which is very acidic. Just as bad as Dasani water. As you can see in the photo I took here, I tested the pH of Evian water and put it next to the acidic pH test of the Icelandic water. At least Evian proves to be true to their claims.

And, I didn't want to be swayed by the brand name, the packaging, the source of the water, etc.  I had a friend help me set it up as a blind taste test.  All water was cold.  After multiple rounds of testing, Icelandic came out on top as my favorite in every round.  I love the taste of this water.  LOVE. IT.  When you do a taste test like this, it's pretty surprising how much difference there is in ""waters"".  Icelandic is so clean and smooth.  No sulfur or chemical or salty or dirty or heavy taste/feel.  Just perfect for me.

  A loamy, almost earthy and tea inflected water, wooly in textured. Metallic and slightly bitter taste like deep, fresh soil-ed soap sponge. Leaves me with a bit of heartburn or sense of roughness. Somewhat bready, but with no butter or cream. I cannot stress how spongy and wooly almost rough it is. There’s give in the supple, full body, a plushness to be expected, but it has some textured bracing heavy tannicness to it. Skip this bottle, and save the plastic. Throw some snow melt over a sweater in dirt, or lost mittens, or sock. Throw a garage wrench in the soup. There’s an finish of iron greasiness. Visit watertastingnotes.com for more reviews
