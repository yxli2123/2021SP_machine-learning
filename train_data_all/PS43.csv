  Yes, just received the back button attachment and put on the DualSHock 4. It is very bulky and hard to hold the controller. Not what I thought it would be. Very unhappy and will be returning

  Trash product dont waste your money. I brought this product about 2 weeks ago i play heavy fps/br games. The product started malfunctioning and turning off my controller and the joysticks could not be moved during the game when I unplug the product. The controller was fine had to go back to using my wire paddles.

  The main reason I got this was because I hate using the R3/L3 buttons, especially when I'm actively trying to move around at the time. This seems pretty perfect.The fit is OK (Not as well placed as, say, a Scuf controller), and solid (much more so than said Scuf). The real issue is that the buttons don't do a parallel input--in other words, I'm fine if I have to move and then click it, but if I use the back button in conjunction with another button, it doesn't work.It would be actively bad on a FPS, I think (haven't used it there yet).

  The Back Button Attachment is easy to install and program. I can't speak to the durability of the device since I've only recently starting using it. It does give you the ability to change change the controller's configuration to suit your playing style. The reason I only gave the Back Button a 4/5 is because it makes the Dual Shock a little more difficult to hold.

    Well worth the $30 if you play FPS or any other fast paced competitive games
  
",5.0,Tushar,"Reviewed in the United States January 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  I got a $10 discount from Amazon for pre-ordering the back button attachment. However I would have bought it for $30 as well.Although I wish Sony had an equivalent of the Xbox elite controller, the back button, for the price, does a fine job. There are 3 different programmable modes for the back buttons and it's very easy to configure. The buttons themselves have good tactile feedback and have enough resistance to prevent accidental presses.Initially I was disappointed in the purchase because it made the controller feel awkward. However, in a couple of days I got used to the new grip. I've configured the buttons to operate as the X, O buttons and have noticed a substantial improvement in my movement speed  and crouch/jump controls in Modern Warfare.If you are the kind of person who normally places their index fingers on the triggers, the back buttons can also serve as useful R1 and R2 buttons.The only drawbacks of the back buttons are that the installation process is a little awkward. I kept worrying that I would break the 3.5 mm jack while installing them. I also wish that they came with 2 additional buttons so I could program the triangle and square as well. I would have been willing to pay more but understand that others might not feel the same way.

    Headsets Don't Plug In Correctly, Doesn't Fit With Skins
  
",2.0,Thomas Kim,"Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  First off, it didn't fit enough to work with a silicone skin on my controller.  It would seem to go in, but it wouldn't power on.  Not a super big deal, I took the skin off my controller.However, although there is a 3.5mm jack on the bottom of this where you can plug in your own headset, the sound cut on and off constantly.  Sometimes I could only hear from the right side, sometimes I couldn't hear anything at all.  I'd adjust the plug and find a ""sweet spot"", but it would still happen.  I tried breaking it in by leaving the headset plugged in overnight, and turning it in place when I wasn't playing games, but to no avail.If you plan to use it without plugging in a headset, it would work.Otherwise, not sure if you'll have better luck than I did!

  Here is the review of long time strike pack user.I have been using the strike pack for over 2 years now. When I bought the ps4 back button attachment my initial reaction was... my god these are bulky. They felt super uncomfortable and I really thought of switching back to strike pack. However after 3 days of use I am completely used to these paddles. They feel soooo good. They are definitely better than the strikepack. The paddle quality and placement is better. Plus they work wirelessly and hv 3 profiles. No point spending the extra 7 bucks on the strike pack. These are definitely better. Although, I should point out that the strike pack didn;t hv any learning curve. I was comfortable with them right of the box even though they were my first paddles. However these did take some time getting used to. However it was worth it.

  A new generation of controllers and still no one has learned from the Steam Controller to add Grip Buttons to their controllers. Basically, just buy this attachment. It will arguably make your controller more next gen then an actual next gen controller.

    Headphone jack is a problem
  
",2.0,Christian,"Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I love the idea of this product, but installing it makes me nervous. The Jack doesn't line up correctly and it seems that the jack on the attachment itself isn't connecting properly. My headset cuts in and out but only when I use the back button attachment. I'll be contacting Sony customer service to see what they can do but initially their customer support is a headache and intentionally confusing, so I don't have high hopes.My suggestion is to go to Walmart and try this out. If you dont like it or it doesn't work, just return it there.

  First, for everyone complaining about the price, just check your local Walmart or Target’s website as I did to see it it’s in stock and go pick it up.The back button attachment is light weight, ergonomic, and subtle. After just a few matches of CoD, I didn’t even notice it and adjusted my play style with it with relative ease, however with intense gameplay, I do accidentally press one of the buttons. You can program up to 3 profiles in the attachment, each with a combination of two buttons from any button on the controller except for the thumb sticks. The instructions were ease enough to read, so I threw them out after one pass because it’s that simple. I highly recommend this product for gamers who don’t want to drop a significant amount of money on custom controllers.

  First some background. I have used many “pro” controllers, own multiple versions of scuff, steam controller, both versions of the xbox elite. This paddles are the real deal, they are bulky and your hands will need to adapt as they need to do when you get a controller with a new form factor. Yes, not as comfortable as an elite controller but for $30, best investment ever. After a 30 min gaming session my hands were adapted and was doing as good as with my scuff impact! If you want to experience what it is to use one of the expensive third party controllers get this. I can tell you it beats everything but a brand new scuff impact, a battle beaver or the new xbox elite controller. All else falls below this.

    Everything you need to know about the DualShock 4 Back Button Attachment by Sony.
  
",3.0,Nick,"Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  Disclaimer:At the time of my writing this review, January 27th, 2020, the DualShock 4 Back Button Attachment was officially released to the market.  I was able to acquire one on release due to pre-ordering, and I will share my initial impressions after playing with it a few hours today, and will update the review as I've garnered more experience with the product.Un-boxing and installation:I was very pleased with the slender box used to carry the unit itself.  Upon opening the box, they craftily placed text, reading ""Important - Read First"", and attached were the directions on how to install and program the unit (for a total of 2 easy steps).  The instructions were very straightforward, although it took me around 5 minutes to install the unit to the controller personally, as there is a little bit of finesse involved and I was afraid of breaking something.  Just trust the directions, and you will be fine.  It doesn't feel like it's going in the right way, but just push in when everything is lined up and it will pop into place.Initial Impressions:The attachment on the controller felt great in the hands when first holding it, and the buttons provide a more crisp, mouse-like click, as opposed to the more silent and less tactile DualShock buttons.  However, after using the product for just about 30 minutes, my hands had already begun to cramp up due to the extra material that I had to grip.  I'll have to update this review after further experience with the product to see if this problem persists, but these buttons are very thick as compared to other slimmer options currently in the market, such as paddles.  I have normal sized hands, but regardless, it will fundamentally change the way you hold your controller and at least from my first experience, it seemed to give me more inputs (obviously) for the trade-off of less control due to the increased surface area of the controller which causes the hand cramping..  I noticed that I could no longer apply pressure to where I used to hold the controller, otherwise I would be pressing these new back buttons.  And if I still want to hold the controller, the pressure has to be applied somewhere else so that it doesn't fall out of my hands.  This is where most of the pressure started building in the sides of my hands, and on my fingers trying to awkwardly hold it but not accidentally pushing the back buttons.  If you have larger hands, it may be a better option for you, but it will still change how you hold your controller, and probably still cause cramping as most of the applied pressure must be at the sides of the controller, rather than around it.Extra information:1. Media coverage of this product advertises the screen as a touchscreen - this is not the case.  By media coverage, I mean from mostly third party news sources and outlets.  At least on this Amazon page, it is correctly addressed as a digital screen.  But do not be mistaken by the media claiming it to be a touch screen, it is simply a digital screen that you operate with the two back buttons themselves, and then the screen itself is a third button in which you can press, but it is not touch-operated.2. The industry standard for backside buttons, or backside paddles for competitive play is 4, and this product only contains 2.  This should not be a problem for most people, but I point it out because if you're purchasing this product then you're probably looking for a competitive advantage, and in that case two less inputs may not be what you're looking for.3. Sony is VERY new to developing any kind of first-party upgrades for their competitive or professional players.  Microsoft has had their own first party elite controller for XBox with backside paddles and numerous other additions for years.  As have countless third party companies and fans created their own renditions of what they think would be helpful to players in the competitive scene..  But this is the first time Sony has created anything like this, and part of the reason they've released this product is because there have been leaks of the DualShock 5 (next gen controller) that show it having paddles, and with this back button attachment, you will most likely be able to use your DualShock 4 on a PS5 and utilize all of its capabilities.  Basically what I'm saying is, this is a test run for Sony.  They're using this product to garner feedback so that they can improve the DualShock 5 when that releases, and it's also their first crack at it, so it may disappoint you until they release something better.4. This product was mainly created for FPS/BR/shooting games for competitive play, although you can certainly use it for any game or genre.5. The attachment does NOT need to be charged.  It works off of your DualShock battery when installed, and the screen is only illuminated when programming it or changing presets.  Otherwise, the screen is off while you are using the controller and it will use next to no charge.6. You can only bind pre-existing DualShock 4 buttons to each of the two back buttons.  Meaning that you're not truly gaining MORE inputs, but you're gaining a more convenient place to press an already existing input..  You're essentially cloning an existing input from anywhere on the controller, and putting it on one of the two back buttons.  And if you've bound one of the back buttons to a specific input, like triangle, for example, you can still use the triangle button.  It will just mean that you can now use the triangle button in two different places, you will NOT lose the ability to use the original input.7. It doesn't seem like it will scratch your controller, as the inside of the attachment is lined with a very soft silicone-type rubber.  The only thing to be cautious of is the application process, as it can be a little tricky to plugin.8. You can press anywhere on the buttons to actuate and trigger them, not just the part that folds out.  This is nice for people of different hand sizes.In closing:It was a very comfortable product when I first put it on the controller and in my hands like I said, but after about 30 minutes my hands had begun to cramp as I had to fundamentally change the way I held my controller.  This is the main reason I gave the product 3/5 stars, as I had to take it off to play more comfortably.  However, the un-boxing experience and directions were very clear.  The installation process itself was a little dicey, again another reason for the rating.  But the quality seems nice, and I think it will last a long time.  I will be installing it again and updating this review once I've had more experience with the product.

  Competitive players do not like to take their hands off the sticks so this attachment helps a ton.  Buttons are nice and soft and the attachment itself is built well and is seamless.  It has the ability to make different presets and change button assignments on the fly with the attachment directly (not needing software).For me the biggest reason why I purchased was that certain button assignments were uncomfortable to use without a paddle option.  I was previously re-mapping with the PlayStation software, which is nice but not as easy or convenient as this attachment.  I no longer need to keep remembering which buttons i swapped, just that the paddles are specifically given an additional option for a button I did not have before.

  Fits onto DualShock 4 controller very nicely. I got used to it after about 30 minutes. The biggest thing I was worried about was that I use a charging stand, so I would have to remove the attachment after each gaming session, but to my surprise, they designed it so it was easy to install/remove, but not too easy that it falls off! Would recommend to anyone playing their PS4 competitively.

  The buttons are just too sensitive.  But really a great position either.  Id get the ones that extend down straight instead of these that are on the back of the grip.  If you accidentally grip your controller it just mashed the two buttons.  If they were more sturdy to press they would be just fine

  Plugs right in and is a solid alternative for someone with a lower budget or someone who likes to game but isn't as invested as someone who buys a Scuf. Each paddle can be programmed to any button on the LED screen with ease. It saves your settings in case you change it to a different controller.

  I bought this attachment thinking it would feel like an add-on that would really benefit me in FPS games like Overwatch or CoD, but honestly, it overall felt like I wasted $30. Controller feels really uncomfortable, I had to be super mindful of accidentally pressing the back buttons, and at one point, one of the presents was deleted from the attachment itself, so I only had 2 instead of 3 available presets.It works as intended, don't get me wrong. But if your muscle memory has become very well acquainted with the PS4 controller, trying to adapt to 2 large back buttons and a larger controller will absolutely throw you off.

    Advantage in Competitive Games
  
",5.0,A.K.,"Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  The back buttons are needed by many competitive players as they provide an advantage by pressing multiple buttons easier and faster. If you play a lot of competitive games, I advice you to buy them. Personally, I did not like the feel of the back buttons as I felt that they added weight to the controller and changed my grip! After few days of keeping them, my hand started to get used to the back buttons but still I just did not really liked them so I just ended up removing the attachment.

    Effective tool with comfort and learning curve
  
",3.0,Nathan M,"Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  I'll preface this by saying I have large hands (long fingers and wide palms, usually size XL gloves) and that I've only spent a few hours with these. I can certainly see benefits already, but I'm also not sure I can use them effectively.The buttons are rather large and take up about half of the 'handles', so learning how to hold the controller with these is proving to be fairly difficult. The buttons activate fairly easily, so trying to balance gripping the controller and avoiding accidental activation is the biggest challenge.Due to the altered grip, my thumbs sit on the analog sticks slightly differently which feels very odd and started to hurt after about an hour or so. I'm not sure how much of this is learning curve or how much is just the design, but I'm not completely sure I could use these as much as I'd like.To improve the design, I would have liked to see the buttons much 'thinner'. Instead of being about an inch or so 'tall', they could have been about as tall as a standard L1/R1 button giving your other fingers more room to grip the controller. I would have preferred them to be far stiffer too.I'm going to keep at it and see if I can overcome the comfort issues because I've been asking for back buttons since Monster Hunter on PS2.

  This is a good device. Im going to cover everything I liked and disliked about it.First of  all, the thing is well made. It feels sturdy enough, and it feels like it will last a long time. Honestly I didnt expect less for a 30 dollar attachment, and it delivered.The little screen and the customization is on point. Its extremely easy to set your buttons, the screen is bright enough and overall I feel like it consumes very little battery. Very intuitive.Other not-so good things are that it feels different of course, and it takes time to get used to it. At first I felt like my fingers were spread all over the controller, and my wrist was a little sore, but eventually you get used to it.For actual gaming, Id say it is very responsive and I like the tactile feedback the buttons give. They are clicky, and can be pressed quite quickly.Probably the thing I didnt like the most, was the installation. I know, it looks very straightfoward, but it took me some 15 minutes to finally set in on position. I felt like I was going to break something because I had to apply some considerable pressure. I made several attempts and many times I decided to reverse. Just be careful, I feel it would be easy to break something if you are not careful.Overall I give it a 4. Probably leaning towards 4.5. Nicely made and works as inteded.

  Ok so I was thinking about getting a scuf controller because I play competitive. But then I found this and it was pretty cheap and had good reviews so I got it. When it arrived I immediately opened it and connected it to my controller.Then I got on Fortnite and binded the paddles. I won so many games and im in contender league. It has no delays so I can take people's walls and it's comfortable. I play non claw and was wondering if I would get used to it and it was perfect.And The headset jack is also great with no issues.In conclusion these paddles are perfect for Fortnite and a great substitution for a scuf controller. I highly recommended them for anyone that plays competitive games. Also if you really are competitive you should really get these, the galaxy kontrol freek thumbsticks, the kontrol freek rings, and the kontrol freek grips.There aren't really any cons for these paddles so that's about it.Thank you for reading this and I hope you buy this product to give yourself the competitive edge and get lots of wins. Have a great day

  This did exactly what it advertised. Added two more buttons to the controller that I can program. I use it mostly for FPS, specifically Borderlands 3. By adding a back button for sprinting and the other for sliding, I can actually run, slide, and aim at the same time now.I'd give it 5 stars, but when you put it on your controller it feels like you're going to break the connector on the back button. You have to shove it on pretty hard to get it to click in. But I know it's not coming off now.You do lose the aux port for charging if that is something you use, which I have to on one of my controllers. So be warned, if you have a charging stand, this will have to be removed in order to charge. And that might be an issue.

I feel like it's the perfect sweet spot.  I can't imagine playing games without it although I mainly play FPS games (Apex, Overwatch, CoD, etc.), this helps tremendously and feels natural and is easy to use and programmable as well.

  It works well.  The remapping feature is nice, the paddles have a satisfying click, and they respond very fast.The downside is that there are only two back buttons  instead of 4, so it’s not quite Elite/Scuf functionality.  If using it to play Call of Duty, you’ll only get jump/crouch or reload/weapon swap, depending on which 2 you prefer to remap.Also, it is quite THICK.  It adds over a third of an inch of thickness to the back grip area.  Your middle finger normally rests on the top grip of the controller, but it now feels somewhat  awkward because of the thickness and the contoured design of the back buttons, requiring you to hold it slightly different.  And using an analog stick extender like the Kontrol Freek (pictured) makes it feel even more awkward.  I had to adjust a bit to it, but  it still worked well. I think Sony could have have come up with something better, like the magnetic  removable paddle systems on Collective Monds Strike Pack, or an Xbox Elite style.But it’s only $30.  DO NOT PAY THE RIDUCULOUS RESELLER PRICES.

    Nice Designed. Extends Functionality.
  
",4.0,Dale R.Top Contributor: Action Figures,"Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is a nice attachment (adapter) that integrates really well into the controller with no design hiccups, or impedance of it's normal functionality.The PS4 Back Button Attachment is a nice addition to the DualShock 4 controller. It gives the controller the same functionality as some of the $150 - $200 elite controllers have. With the ability to map two button actions to this attachment, under three different profiles, I'm able to perform gameplay abilities much faster. I don't have to take that 1-second to remove a finger for depressing a button. This allows to to keep my reaction time quick, and I won't lag in actions.The adapter is not without it's flaws though. Although the adapter may not be everyone's cup of tea, it certainly provides a form & function that was only exclusive to the very expensive pro controllers on the market.One of the things that would help gamers is knowing which of the three profile modes you're in. I had trouble knowing which of the three different profiles I had programmed. I have to turn the controller over quickly to look at the OLED to see what I've selected exactly. Maybe a revision version 2 by Sony will correct this tiny detail omission.The feel of the adapter is real nice though, with my middle fingers resting nicely on the back button triggers very well. Accidental button presses were at a minimal, but I did find myself occasionally having them. This doesn't happen if I rest the controller on a flat surface, but if I put it in my lap I've done ti quite a few times unfortunately. It's something to be mindful of.Installing the adapter to my DualShock 4 was easy too, but the 3.5mm jack input on the adapter needs to be lined-up very straight before pushing it all of the way in. Although the adapter jack is on a moveable swivel, I was a bit nervous pushing the adapter in too hard. It'll be interesting to see how the quality of this moveable jack stands up over time, since it's the only moving part that concerns me, and I'll be installing/removing this adapter an awful lot.This brings to the part where removing the Back Button Attachment will be a daily process for me unfortunately, if I want to charge my controller with my controller charging stand. Since the bottom ports are covered by the device, I can't use my current charger stand to recharge my battery. Charger stands that use the top port won't be affected by this though, and removal of the Back Button Attachment won't be a daily chore by those gamers.Overall the Back Button Attachment feels really nice, and it integrates superbly well into the DualShock 4 controller's aesthetic. It's engineered well for a tight fit, and the quality of the product feels solid. I don't notice any problems whatsoever with battery life either, as the OLED is only illuminated for a few seconds before it automatically turns off. Also, the adapter doesn't replace the existing buttons on the controller, everything works with the attachment installed. The adapter simply serves as an ergonomic way of button activation, but full functionality of the controller remains intact.This attachment won't be for everyone, and not everyone needs to have this in order to play better either. However, if you've been on the fence & considering purchasing an elite controller but are on a budget, then this is absolutely positively a cost-effective alternative that won't hurt your wallet at all. At $29.99 it's a well priced device. I definitely recommend this product for any passionate gamers out there.

  It isn’t anything like we expected, my son has tried it although his fingers aren’t that long so he can’t get them to go around the paddles so therefor they’ll be another wasted piece bought that won’t get used. The paddles are right at 3/8” off of the controller. He had used a friends struck pack and liked the paddles although the struck pack kept disconnecting that’s why we tried this for him. Not for kids hands. If we had it to do all over again we would have save our cash.

  Good build quality. Works as expected. Only one button assignable per button, no multi-button combos per button. Needs time to get used to even when using middle fingers or ring fingers. Easily pressed accidentally when squeezing the R2/L2 buttons when not careful. Makes the controller slightly bulky at the back. Overall, it COULD make or break the experience and it's by personal opinion. Not too expensive. Recommended and nice to have it as collection.

  Bought this after rebuilding my scuff controller several times.  Quality and easy of install were both great.......BUT button placement sucks. If you're used to a scuff them you grip with your index to pinky on both sides and when you want to use the paddle  you lift off of the side and tap the button.  These buttons are too far out, its where you normally ""grip"" the controller.  This causes a lot of accidental button presses.  The two arms with buttons should be shorter, closer to the center of the controller so you can grip it regularly, and lift and touch a button when needed.

    DualShock Back Button Attachment
  
",5.0,YFZ450,"Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  This back button attachment is a game changer!PS must have gotten their communication mixed up on their release date because every store was either sold out, the employees didn’t know when it was coming out, or postings online had different release dates.Moving on ... I never saw myself buying a $200+ controller just to try out back buttons so when this came out I had to jump at the opportunity to see what all the hype was about.First things first the fit and finish is great and the clicks are tactile. Wish the screen was in the front, but that’s just a small issue. It is slightly bulkier than I thought it would be. If they slimmed it down a bit on the height of the buttons that would have been perfect.Game play takes a lot getting use to at least for me. I found myself clicking the right back button when I was trying to press R2 to shoot, but it kinda came to my advantage as I successfully executed multiple drop shots lol. Also, if you’re like me getting a firm grip of your controller during gameplay and knowing that it is planted in your hands makes gaming a bit more comfortable, but the attachment actually keeps you from doing that. Once attached the buttons come up under your middle fingers so the only fingers really gripping the controller are your ring and pinky finger, but I’m getting use to it.Overall I’m glad PS finally came out with their own version of a back button and hope this is a glimpse of what’s to come with the new DualShock 5 (hopefully Elite version 😬).

",1.0,Jarod,"Reviewed in the United States February 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  I really wanted to like the new back button attachment but these are horribly designed. Maybe it’s because I have larger hands but I can’t grip the controller what so ever with how far the buttons go down the handle part of the controller. I am constantly pressing the buttons when I’m simply trying to just hold the controller with a firm grip. The whole length of the button is clickable with no spot to grip without pressing the button. And the buttons are super thick.I have used an Xbox elite controller and fps dominator attachment and much prefer their smaller paddles which still allow you to grip the controller. My only complaint for the fps dominator was that it requires a headset for audio so I was hoping I’d enjoy these new buttons to be able to play with audio through my monitor for more chill gaming sessions.The quality is nice otherwise and the ease of changing hotkeys is also great. But it is otherwise unusable for me personally.

However adding this to a spare controller and having 2 extra buttons is great. Super easy to setup and getting used to the bottom buttons is easy. The hard part for me is getting used to 2 buttons instead of 4 lol. Great accessory for the DS4. If you don't have one pick it up. I really hope they are using this as a test case for the upcoming PS5 and that the DS5 will come with extra buttons. Controllers need to evolve again just like we went from 2 buttons to 4, to 8. We need to go to 12 with buttons on the bottom.

  Just got the product so i haven't had extensive use with it, but I have played a few games of call of duty with it. Gotta say, not disappointed with it. Feels good in the hands, and it's easy to program the buttons. All you got to do is press and hold the button at the bottom of the screen, then press the back buttons to scroll through a list of buttons you can select on each back button. Default it's circle on the right, X on the left. Here is a list of all the buttons you can program into it. Triangle, circle, X, square, up, right, down, left, L1, R1, L2, R2, L3, R3, and the start button. So no share button or touch pad button. Other than that, all I got to say is the back buttons are really easy to push in. They got a nice click to them. I did find myself accidently hitting the back buttons when I didn't want intend to. Maybe with a little more time I'll get more used to it. As of right now work the money.

  Works as advertised. Buttons have a bit of a click to them to help stop accidental presses and they rest right on top of where the serial number label is on the back of the controller. The OLED display turns of after about 3 seconds so its not draining your battery constantly, although I haven't tested it out fully to see if just having the attachment plugged in drains your controller battery faster or not. Be careful when first attaching it as the headphone jack is at an angle and is adjustable, so it could easily break if forced in wrong.

  They work as far as button use.  They are easy to program and moderately easy to install.  However,  they are not for me.  The buttons are exactly in the spot where I hold the controller on the back so it is a waste of money.  Who knows, some people may have strange fingers that don't touch the handles on the controller.  If you have crooked fingers or ones like E.T., this product is for you!

  My scuf controller joystick was broken, so I sent it in and bought this with a hair trigger mod pack and a ps4 controller, I have to say it was a solid controler after. The only 1 issue I had with the buttons was comfort, day 1 of use my hands were sore as hell from being raised off the controller slightly more then normal. I did get used to it but constantly thought wow these are kinda in the way of my grip. Had multiple preset options so you can use for different games, felt durable, and fit the controller exact, which made getting it on a lil challenging but no big deal. Also still had headphone jack which I didn't need but thought was a smart keep

  Works exactly as advertised. No complaints there. Installation and configuration are as easy as can be.Problem is that it's uncomfortable. Getting my fingers (middle) on it forces me to hold the controller in an unnatural way that makes my hands sore quickly. It also makes reaching L1 and R1 awkward. I spent a couple hours with it trying to get used to it, but eventually ripped it out in frustration. Not sure I'll end up putting it back in ever...

    More convenient gaming experience
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2020","With this attachment; you are able to map two programmable buttons to paddle buttons to the back of the controller without disabling the buttons programed.

Able to program any button the duel shock controller except the share and touch pad button

Very ergonomic. Takes a while to get used to if you never use a controller with back paddles before.

This makes it more convenient when playing first person shooters where you don't have to move your thumb off the right thumb stick to press the jump button throwing off your aim (especially in games that has double jumps, slides and/or jet packs).

Good for RPGs where you can map any of the D-pad buttons for item use, or other special abilities

For racing games you can buttons to shift gears or use weapons

Or if you don't like to use claw method when holding the controller (for L2, R2); it's more ergonomic to use this attachment.

There's no input lag when using.

Able to use this wirelessly.

It uses the controller's battery. Has same battery life as if you were to use controller regularly without attachment. Unless you keep touching the LED program buttons

LED is not on all the time, only on when you need to adjust something

No need to plug into PC/laptop, or go into Ps4 settings to map buttons.

Tap the LED on back to change up to 3 profiles

Hold to go to edit/map button screen, cycle through buttons you want with paddle buttons, then click LED to set. Single button mapping only. Not able to do multiple inputs, or turbo functionality.

To physically install align audio jack and pres in. Once in, it fits like a glove.

Button has good click to them. Not too loose and not too firm

There's an audio jack pass-through for those who use wired controllers

It does have a little weight. When attached will weight about same as X1 controller with batteries inside

If you use dock charging stations, some 3rd party ones where you dock from bottom may get in the way with attachment on

May not fit some 3rd party controllers

If you're looking for a more comfortable gaming experience, or one that gives you a slight advantage when gaming it's a very good purchase. Way better than purchasing a $100+ controller* with back paddles.

*Note that some of these $100+ controllers may have extra functionality such as swapable/modular thumbsticks/D-pad with sensibility adjustments, extra padding on grip, able to program multiple inputs into one button, more than 2 paddles, etc. But if you just want back paddles on your controller without the other extras it's a very affordable.",

  I bought one from Gamestop because they received their stock early and like many of you, my Amazon order had no shipping information.The backbutton attachment fits the Dual Shock 4 very well and is responsive. Programming is easy. Also, unlike many 3rd party items, it is completely wireless.I rate it 4 stars because the placement of the buttons and how it affects your grip on the controller takes some getting used to. Also, I think it is draining my controller battery quicker. I suppose that is to be expected because it uses the controller for power.Either way, this item's official retail release date is 2/4/2020, so go pre-order it from a retailer or wait for Amazon to get it together.

  The buttons are nice and wide and click when the push down on them.  Sound quality out of the headphone port is good, I don't notice a difference...The only thing I will say is that some times the headphone cord will get in the way of your fingers, I point it straight up and it's not an issue.  Be careful putting it down as it's really easy to hit those buttons.The biggest thing for me was getting used to using my middle fingers like triggers.  It's not as bad as having your index on L1/R1 and middle on the L2/R2, it is FAR more comfortable.  However I did find myself under stress jumping up and down and reloading instead of aiming and firing.  That's gotten much better though! You also can't have a deathgrip on the controller and changing hand positions slightly has affected my aim.  Just expect these thing to happen, but it will be temporary.

  Bought this for my second controller, I modded my main one with another kit that you can find on Amazon and wanted to try and compare with this one.  It was more of a pain to install this thing than opening the first controller, solder the pcb, add the attachment button and put back everything together. You have to apply a lot of force to it in order to get it in place and I was really afraid for the jack plug. Go for it if you don t feel comfortable opening your controller but know that it might be one of the less practical solution. Added pictures of the 2 controller so you can make your own opinion.

",1.0,CrankTop Contributor: Rock Music,"Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  I tried this out for an hour. It's absolutely painful for me. My pinky has nowhere to grip on the controller. It's a huge attachment that takes up half of the DS4 handles. It changes my grip and makes it completely awkward to hold.I have no idea how anybody with even average hands could say this thing is comfortable. It's great to use jump on the right side, but I just can't grip the controller properly, and I have average to large hands.Functionally, it adds no new buttons, so you can't negate R3 or L3 and then put them on here. You still have to have a button on those inputs, making it useless for getting away from those buttons because they are so often pressed without you wanting to actually press them.I wanted to love this thing, but it's a complete waste of money. Whoever engineered this maybe did their best job, but the DS4 is simply not big enough for it. It needs another inch on the handles to accommodate this thing. Without that I get cramps within ten minutes, and it just feels awkward to use.They really just need a Pro controller with better and slimmer back buttons built into the controller. This simply does not work for me. Add an inch to the DS4 handles and it would work. Otherwise complete waste of time and money. Returned.

  Overall: The back button attachment is pretty cool, it definitely adds versatility to your gameplay but is a little bulky and takes some getting used to. I'd recommend for any FPS games or other games where button press time is key.Pros: Adds a quick and easy way to map any 2 buttons. I use it primarily so I dont have to move my right thumb to press the square, circle, triangle, and X buttons.Cons: It does add some bulk and feels a little clunky. Press the buttons with your middle fingers takes getting used to.

  The best part is that you have the two buttons and how easy you can configure which button you desire. The downside is (personal) I use the bumpers to shoot and ADS because I don’t have trigger stops for the L2/R2 so it was unnatural to keep the bumpers as my primary buttons in FPS. Once I put my pride aside and used L2/R2 I realize how well placed the buttons are.They should’ve created this sooner...Now if your hands get sweaty.... it might be hard to place this in the controller if you have a sweat grip already on (it’s possible but extremely difficult)

    Now Keyboard Can Screw Off
  
",4.0,Kevin Radcliffe,"Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  I got this to be more competitive in Apex Legends. All the time, you would see computer player bhopping and doing all sorts of rapid inputs that a controller player on console could never dream of. Now, with this, I can bhop too with the best of them! Plus this is an official peripheral and isn't some third party mojo.I really like it but it takes a HUGE learning curve. First you have to understand that you now have bulky buttons on the bottom of your controller so now your hand position is moved a bit. Plus, to utilize the buttons properly, you sacrifice a little reach to other buttons on your controller. Everything is still within reach but things will not be as streamlined and efficient as it used to be until you adjust things. An example: I have my crouch button mapped to what I will call L4. To hold down L4 and spam jump to bhop, I have to hook my fingers around to the jump button and remap the heal button so that I can reach it because while holding L4, I cannot reach up on the dpad.Basically, if you are buying this to be more competitive online, be prepared for a learning curve and readjusting your playstyle and the way you use your controller. It will take time and practice and you will likely be playing around with custom mappings a lot until you figure out what is most comfortable and works for you.Pros:- Works as intended.- Easy to program.Cons:- Buttons are a bit bulky and can accidentally be pressed if you lay the controller on a hard surface with enough force.- However, the buttons still require a bit of force to activate. Not a ton, but more than your L2 and R2 do.- There is a very slight input lag from the programmed buttons. It is a few milliseconds but it is noticeable compared to actually pressing the button on the controller itself.Overall: 4 out 5. Would still recommend for competitive gaming but not necessary for casual gaming. The cons drop it to a 4, especially the input lag issue. However, I still rated highly because it accomplishes what it set out to do and will give you an edge online over those without it in terms of what you can pull off with your button combinations.

  The back button attachment was an impulse buy for me when I saw it briefly pop up to order. I love it, though I didn't at first.The attachment fits snugly in the middle of the DualShock 4, plugging into the headphone jack. The two buttons are fully customizable and can be changed very easily. They don't do anything unique; rather, they just mirror the functionality of two other buttons at the discretion of the player, and those buttons can be basically anything other than the touchpad or the control sticks.I was playing Borderlands 3 when I first got the back button. I distinctly remember that night having some wrist pain. However, with use over the next two or so days, that subsided and my hands quickly adapted to the additional functionality provided by this attachment.An important element of the buttons is that they do not have any pressure sensitivity. I found that particularly helpful for games like Tony Hawk where a quick tap of the (X) button would work better than taking the additional probably .05 seconds to press the pressure-sensitive face (X) button in. It's also helpful for button mashing. You could theoretically map both buttons to the same button, thereby creating three of the same button on the controller and making it much easier to spam the button.I did not notice any impact on battery life for the controller (which has pretty bad battery life anyway) from using this attachment. It adds some weight, but you quickly get used to it. It's not a 1:1 comparison, but it reminds me of how quickly I adapted to the addition of the Rumble Pak for the N64 controller, which added significant weight to the controller.I was frankly very disappointed that the DualSense does not have back buttons and is not compatible with this device, at least not at the launch of the PS5. I think that speaks volumes about the relative quality of this product.  I can see lots of advantages for competitive multiplayer games coming from this attachment, though I don't play games online, so I couldn't personally say how advantageous it is firsthand.The Back Button Attachment is a smart add-on to the DualShock 4. If you can get it, even if you just play single-player games, it's well worthwhile.

  Works flawlessly.Button clicks feel premo.Easy to customize the button.Designed to fit and work naturally.Very impressive.If it had extra two back buttons like xbox elite, that would be great, but really not necessary.  Made a decent ps4 controller great.  Add a pair of analog stick height extenders and you are set.

  Don't waste your money. I bought this thinking you could reasign buttons and disable the other ones, well, that is not the case. Whatever buttons you assign to this thing stay active on the rest of the remote. You can't even change them to a different function. It's complete pointless and I am probably throwing mine in the garbage next time I get on my PS4.

    First day impression from a not competitive player
  
",4.0,Belarace Quilsanfis,"Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  Pros - 2 extra, not bound buttons to reassign existing buttons to.. I'm heavily expecting to use it to replace L3/R3 in most games cause I hate that input method, always feel like I'm gonna break my stick. Or maybe replacing L1/R1 so I can keep my index on the triggers/gas pedals of L2/R2 which I had to mod with extenders to make feel right.- Pretty quick/responsive to program and the middle button/mode selector isn't always on and remembers your inputs.Cons- Fundamentally changing how I hold the controller. I've never been a 2 fingers on top person, preferring games that let my index finger dance across L1/L2, R1/R2 so I've usually gripped more with my middle finger in the back. Now I'm either gonna have to use my middle fingers on the slightly lower buttons while losing handle grip with my ring and pinky (since the controller is now not long enough) or I have to try to teach myself to use my ring fingers for these buttons while cramping my middle fingers either on top of L2/R2 or just above the buttons while now slightly altering/cramping my usually floater index fingers.. For those already used to two fingers on top, probably less of an issue cramp wise but still an adjustment.- Can I get a 150% larger controller to go with this? maybe the Dual Shock 4 XL or something? Build in the buttons/paddles..- You do gotta scroll through each possible button assignment but I'd rather that then pre-program setsIf the PS5 does have these extra buttons/paddles..hopefully it won't be so cumbersome and hopefully they don't assign anything to them.. Seriously stop taking away options.

  So ya looking to get  into programmable controllers, you are here for the PS4. what can ya do with this device? well you have 3 diffident settings or profiles. If ya love the first shooters games, game on!!! what if if ya like the driving games then game on as well!! the point is this it has endless potential no matter what your game is!!!!!! Pics from left to right, ps4 back button attachment, collective minds strike pack, Brooks marine strike pack, extremrates back cover mod, and then the Astro c40 ps4 controller. There is pros and cons to all of them but for the price I’d will stick with the ps4 back button. It give a premium feel and look to the controller like the Astro c40 plus look closely the buttons are real close of the location. All the ad ons all are programmable  but button location, cost, look, and feel. My pick is the Play Station back button pack for all listed things listed the collective strike is really nice but you have to be wired to your console and will not work wireless.

  I like that I can program the buttons in the back. I thought it would help alleviate some of the thumb pain I was having by pushing down the L3 button. It did help, but I feel like the majority of the pain comes from the layout of the ps4 controller itself. So do I regret this purchase? No, I still think it's useful and it does help a bit with the thumb soreness as I'm not having to push down on L3. It is pricey though for an attachment. You could buy a third party controller with a xbox configuration and programmable back buttons for a little more than this though. (Just something to consider). It also has a bit of a learning curve to get used to it, but what new process doesn't?

  The time it tales to move from one top of controller trigger to that other can be completely eliminated with this. For me the size of the standard controlled is a bit small for my hands and not using my middle fingers to hold the bottom of the controller has caused issues when split seconds count. The buttons are able to be triggered without being directly on top of it. The install is a little uncomfortable the first time or two but the setup is ridiculously simple. I truly enjoy this product and have, and will continue, to recommend this product to friends and fellow players.

  First of all, I am really impressed by the quality and fit of this. It's not a chintzy add-on, and it shouldn't be since it's an OEM accessory. It's very easy to change settings on the fly and most importantly the paddles are solid, accessible, good clicky feedback. I say it's not for everyone because it definitely alters the way I hold the controller. It's easy to accidentally hit the paddles depending on your grip. It takes getting used to so that you only hit the paddles when you intend to. I've heard some smaller hands having a harder time gripping the controller with paddles. I have average adult man hands. If your hands fit well and you can slightly alter your grip, it's as good of an accessory you can get. Well built and designed to fit perfectly on the stock controller. I greatly prefer using the stock controller because of reliability and easy replacement if needed. My original stock controllers are still working perfect even after a lot of regular use. This isn't the case with aftermarket paddle controllers. Now if only Sony would make one of these for the PS5 or even better, a ""pro"" controller with built in paddles.

  Saw this on sale for 33% off and decided to get one, skeptically... After attaching it you notice how solid it fits and how little it adds in weight. The triggers have a great feel to them and it is easily programmable to any button that's not the touch pad or share. Played a few hours of modern warfare to get the hang of it. I've never used a scuf so it was a new experience to me. By the end of my session I was jumping while turning in mid air aiming down sights and pwning fools. Don't need to remove my thumb from the joysticks anymore... Couldn't recommend it more if you're looking for an easily affordable mod to your existing controller. Not quite the $200+ gaming controllers 3rd parties make but it's good enough for me. No hesitation on giving it 5 stars!

    Defective unit
  
",5.0,Alex Pizarro,"Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  Sadly as of right now, mines doesn't work. I have a PS4 pro and it turns my controller fully off within minutes. There has nothing been wrong with my controller before and the moment I plug in this attachment, it turns off my controller within minutes. I believe I have a defective unit which is a bummer because I bought this as a cheaper alternative to a scuff controller.I've even plugged the attachment to my roommates controller and it does the same thing.UPDATE: Bit the bullet and purchased a new controller and I don't have this problem at all. I guess the controller that came with my PS4 Pro just isn't compatible with this attachment.The attachment itself is solid and constructed very well and it's a solid alternative to buying a Scuf Controller

   It is a little large. Not recommended for smaller hands.That being said I do love it can't knock off any stars here. Took like a week or two and feels natural now.I play FortNite mostly and it is a great help to keep my right thumb on the analog stick for aiming. While letting me build and jump without removing a thumb from analog stick.Make sure it's lined up straight with the plug pressed firmly and it snapped right in. Was set up perfectly straight out of the box. X on the right and O on the left for fortnite and several other games I play.Have and will keep recommending.Not super thrilled though that the ps5 won't be compatible. To me is a mistake on Sony side to have nothing similar or compatibility of this sort hoping that will be remedied some day. Just saying 😌

    Scuff controller killer and Cod player settings with it
  
",5.0,Charles McGowan,"Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  I had this product for a week now and I'm loving it! Right out of the box really easy to set up button wise you can configure any button on the controller which is great for other games too. but I would say the only issue I had with this device is it's really hard to put onto the controller itself but when it clips in its very snug and tight feeling I recommend looking up a video on how to properly put it the attachment on. On Call of duty, I'm a former a bumper jumper tactical player so I would slide with my R3 and have my knife for Circle and my jump on L1. I made that change back in advanced warfare for jet packs strafing. But unfortunately, I felt like on drops in Warzone or in gulags I couldn't knife properly because my knife was on my circle. For call of duty, I recommend changing your settings to default flipped with R1 and L1 being your shoot and aiming the back button attachment felt too close for the triggers for me since I have moderately big hands. I put the circle to slide on right paddle and X to jump on left paddle, Aim response curve dynamic, weapon and motion blur disabled, use/reload behavior- contextual tap, slide behavior tap, automatic tactical sprint activated. With these settings, you should be able to slide cancel and be zooming around the map. I've heard some horrid reviews about scuff and many other third-party controllers like Astro, strike pace, bacon that cost anywhere from $75 to $300. I had even tried to make my own extreme rate controller with back buttons and failed the soldering of it. I'm so grateful for PlayStation for making this product!!!

  I was surprised at how sturdy this attachment is. It really works well and feels like part of the controller. I was concerned it would cause my battery life to take a hit but so far I can't notice much. Probably best for shooter games so you can keep your thumb on the aiming joystick and still hit the triangle/circle/square/cross buttons.

  I use this on systems other than the ps4 and am really glad the programming of the buttons is not software based and can be done at any time on the unit.

  I purchased this at launch, and I am so glad I did. There are a ton of companies out there now making custom controllers, and if you are an avid console gamer, you definitely need the right controller. I believe the price has gone up, but it is still cheaper and better than spending money on Scuf.Sony was a bit late to the game with this one but better late than never. If you are still debating on whether you want to get it or not, I am telling you, get it!

  I cant really knock it. It's well designed and does what it's supposed to do well. The problem I have is that I couldn't get use to using it. I didn't realize how unnatural it would feel to try to use a back button for jump, and that's pretty much the main use for it. For some people they'll adjust to this and it will give them an advantage for sure, but just realize that it may not be so easy for you, just as it was not for me. I've pretty much given up, but I might try again another time. We'll see.

    A good idea with some poor ergonomics
  
",3.0,Wildcatmama2,"Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  I think the functionality and idea of this back button attachment was great, but in the end it was just too uncomfortable to hold my controller with it on.I tend to grip the controller tightly and accidentally hit L3/R3 on some controllers in the heat of the moment, so my main concern that they would be too easy to accidentally press was thankfully not an issue- the buttons are firm, with a good tactile clicky response to them.  The unit contours to the Dualshock 4 well.  I still think it's a bit silly that the screen is on the back, but it's easy enough to flip it over and re-assign the buttons to whatever you like.It just hurts my hands.  Maybe your mileage will vary, but leaving my pinky and ring finger with the last little bit left of the handles at the bottom was uncomfortable for me.  The thickness and placement of the buttons seems like the main culprits to me.I really wanted to like it, I claw grip all the time and it was easy enough to adjust to using a back button instead of curling my index finger down, but you'll have to try it for yourself to see if it makes your day-to-day use less comfortable.

    Large Hands Review
  
",4.0,Colin,"Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  With regards to setup and functionality the PS4 button attachment gets a perfect 5 out of 5 stars.  Unfortunately it's not very ergonomical for a person with large hands like myself.I'm 6'7 and after about a half hour of using it my hands began to get very cramped and sore.  The bulkiness and placement of the ps4 button attachment takes up precious real estate underneath the controller where I usually keep my fingers tucked in.  With the button attachment in place it became necessary for me to slide my hands further down the controller which is both awkward and uncomfortable because my pinky fingers are essentially hanging off the controller.I really wanted to make this thing work because it really does offer some great utility with fps games.  So after giving it some thought I ""engineered"" a solution.  Haha, I pushed a couple of toilet paper rolls onto the handles and tucked them underneath the button attachment.Haha, it's a very ""derelict"" mod but I don't care, it keeps my hands from cramping and allows me to continue using the darn thing.  I'm going to go ahead and order a playbudz grip extender but for now this works.

  Rewiring your brain and hands to do something you’ve spent years doing is NOT easy. However, as the times changes, you have to adapt. I have put off buying this for a long time, but finally took the plunge and I’m happy I did!It takes a bit of time of get used to using your fingers in a totally new way with the DS4, but just as I learned and struggled the first time, I am doing so again. It’s been inconsistent so far, but I’ve noticed myself feeling much more even against other players in PVP games and can’t wait to continue improving. Definitely give it a shot if you’re on the fence!

    Super uncomfortable and clumsy.  Cmon Sony - Update
  
",4.0,Travis E.,"Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  I think I am going to be sending this back.  After about a half hour of play, my hands are extremely uncomfortable and cramping.  The buttons feel big and bulky, and make it hard to get a proper grip on the controller.  I have used thinner paddle mods on Xbox controllers and those are much more comfortable.  Sony has a nice idea here, but was not able to execute in product design.Button mapping works great and it would be a decent product other than the unnatural grip/feel.  I have medium hands FYI.  Maybe if you have giant hands this would be more useable?  I don’t think I could ever play well with these, even if I got used to them.  Definitely disappointed.Update:  So, after using other back button mods/attachments, I have found this attachment to be much more bearable.  I think there is definitely a ""break-in"" period where your hands have to get used to gripping the controller differently, but once you are used to it, it is a very nice accessory.  Performs well, and despite the slight awkwardness (compared to a standard grip on the controller) the benefit of the additional buttons far outweighs any negative criticisms that I have.  Changing my review to 4 stars, because it isn't perfect, but pretty good.  I would recommend.

  So I’m giving it a 1 star not because I used and didn’t like it. I’m giving it a 1 star because I didn’t even get to use it, before it broke. I wish it was simpler to install because everytime I would try it would just stop and being afraid to break it I would not push it anymore. This is my second day trying to after watching videos and guides, but it still managed to not fit and break upon adding a little bit of force to it. Not worth the $30.

",2.0,Salvador lopez,"Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  Purchased these at Walmart and I thought it was going to be amazing, the closest thing to having an “elite” controller from Sony. I put them on and they are massive. I play first person shooters and these take so much space it’s crazy, I just don’t know how to place my fingers behind the controller with these on. I tried multiple different ways but it only throws off my aim and cramps the heck out of my hands. Sometimes I accidentally press and button that I did not mean to. It sucks because the Xbox Elite controller is the only thing that kinda makes me jealous of Xbox. Hopefully they make an elite version of the dualsense controller for the PS5...

  So, yeah, I just got this *much anticipated* , sold out everywhere, item this morning and thus far is a whopping ""meh"" of a device.First off the good: It's high quality, it's sturdy, the buttons have a nice tactile feel. It's easy to setup and change button configurations. It's basically everything you'd expect from a Playstation product. Oh, and the fact it's only $30, if you can find it, makes it an attractive buy.Now on to the bad: It's useless for it's intended design, IMO. There are only two buttons (which is fine) but they are skewed out to the left and right instead of down, like every other paddle style controller. They actually impede the way you would typically hold the controller and it becomes uncomfortable to use. After using the Elite and a couple of Sony third party paddle controllers, this is extremely disappointing. I'm currently playing through Nioh 2 and it actually makes the game harder to play due to the way the paddles are designed. It literally feels better to just use the standard DS4.Bottom line: If you need extra buttons, don't want to spend for the third party versions, and aren't very particular, I guess it's an alternative for the price. If you're someone used to Microsoft's Elite controller or one of the many PS4 paddle alternatives, you'll be let down.

    Good Alternative For An Elite Controller.
  
",4.0,Stuart C,"Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  The product is super easy to use and setup. No fuss and you can get gaming within minutes. Remappable profiles and buttons on the fly is very convenient and a great feature that lets you customize and get comfortable with the configuration you want.If you have never used an elite controller with back buttons, this does take time getting used to, and time learning to use the back buttons. Buttons are responsive and easy to hit, but this also means that in some instances you can accidentally hit the wrong button, your natural grip on the controller will also have to be adjusted to get used to the unit being on your controller.Once on the controller, the unit fits snug, does not move and performs well. Overall an excellent alternative to spending $300 on an elite controller and arguably the biggest positive of this product, you can replace a worn out controller without breaking the bank waiting months for a custom controller.

  I'm just purchasing a second one since they're on sale, and since I'm not sure if these will be discontinued any time soon. While I plan to eventually upgrade to a PS5, the Dualshock 4 is my go-to PC controller, and likely will continue to be even if I discover that I can get the same functionality out of a Dualshock 5 - mainly because the DS5 costs $70 and has features that aren't likely to be compatible with many PC games, if any.The buttons are clicky. They're easy to reach, but I should mention that you don't want to map anything to them that you're going to have to rapidly press over and over. Being located where it is makes it difficult to spam very fast. Nothing to do with the product - this would be the case with a Scuf controller as well.It's very easy to quickly remap the buttons, as well as to switch between profiles. The screen makes it helpful, though it would be even more helpful if it appeared on the front, so as to be able to switch on the fly without having to turn the controller around. It's a very minor gripe though, and not worth taking points away, at least in my opinion.This is a fantastic solution for someone looking for a poor man's Scuf. It's even better in a way, as it's not only far, far cheaper to buy this and a DS4, but because it can be easily switched between controllers. When something goes wrong with your controller, instead of dealing with Scuf customer service/repair and/or buying another outrageously expensive controller, you can just replace the DS4 and throw this attachment onto it.NOTEThere is a very, very slight delay with its button presses. I didn't even notice it for months, until I tried to use it while playing a specific Overwatch character and tried to pull of a specific move that requires very specific timing, where two buttons need to be depressed at exactly the same time. I noticed that when using the face buttons, I had no problem performing the move, but that when I used the back-button mapping of the same face button, I could only successfully execute the move if I pressed the back-button very, very shortly before pressing the appropriate shoulder button. I'm talking a matter of milliseconds. The delay won't be relevant in almost any contexts, but it is there, and so I think it's worth mentioning for anyone considering this attachment.

  My goals with the purchase of this product are to eliminate the amount of time's of purchasing a new controller or having it warrantied X amount of times per year. The dual shock controller is not a bad controller at all, however I would like to see one built by Sony for those of us with bigger hands.After X amount of replacement controller's through the years, I've taking the time to disassemble the controller to see what is failing inside the controller. It's best to just use the warranty I purchased.In case your curious....The character on the game I play will start to wander..nothing you want to have when your on a looter shooter style of game.The game I play requires me to press down on the left thumb stick to Sprint and consistent movement with both thumb sticks. The controller gets a ton of abuse.Soooo I was able to program the new devise to a brand new controller with no complications. Super easy to use!!!I now use the paddle to sprint and to toss grenades at enemies is on my other paddle. As others stated, the controller will still stay the same, getting out of old habit's was the hardest part.I've added the stick on grip's to my controller handle, it fit but it was a tight fit.I'd recommend giving this product a try, the product is great!!! If only the controller had small medium and large options...this would be a game changer.Why this wasn't an added feature from the get go...is beyond me?Using a factory PS4 dual shock controller. Kontrol Freeks cushions and thumb stick.

  Bought this when I had to send my Scuff in for repair and played with it for a few months. Overall it worked well, was easy to set up and use, and fit comfortably on the controller. Buttons on rear require a bit more pressure than the Scuff back paddles - but due to their position on the controller it’s more of a squeeze of hand than pushing a button. Great option for casual gamer or someone who wants to try out back buttons before investing in an expensive elite controller. The upside to this attachment over elite controllers is that it can be transferred to any PS4 controller, so when it’s time for a new one you don’t have to repurchase.

  After three months they constantly stop working mid-game and you are forced to detach and reconnect them.  It's very annoying.  Often even this has to be done multiple times because when you plug them back in they fail to fully initialize.  You'll know if they're going to work if after displaying the PSN logo you see the configuration layout in the display.  If you don't see that then you'll have to again disconnect and reconnect the attachment.  Absolutely horrible.While the attachment can be programmed it does NOT disable/replace the button being mapped.For example, if you want to use this because you keep accidentally pressing R3 or L3 and you map those inputs to the attachment you will still suffer from accidentally pressing L3 or R3.recently they stop working mid-game and you are forced to detach and reconnect them.  It's very annoying.I recommend trying these out but think of them as a very cheap and temporary fix while you save up for controllers with the paddles fully integrated.

So you can with that delete all ability of the paddles. However the paddles do come with a ""reset to default"" feature that overrides any customization. Simply by holding all 3 buttons for 5 seconds. Easy fix.The paddles themselves also do NOT act as a seperate keybind. You have to map it to any of the 16 presets on the Dualshock 4.i.e. X, O, R1, L3.

  Does the job perfectly !! You don't even need to spend 150-200 for a ""Pro Controller"" 👎🏼 when you can buy this little gadget.You just pop it in carefully without forcing it too much and it looks like it's part of the controller.Buttons are great ! They are clicky, to avoid being pressed by mistake, not noisy at all I would say. It took me about 1-2 days maybe to get used with it.You can remap any button on controller to be used for the back bittons.It feels different at beggining, but after a while you get used with it.Positionong of the buttons I would say is just perfect for me, as they sit right where your fingers would rest on the back of the controller.

  I bought this to play CoD Warzone mainly and use the buttons for jumping and crouching.Had it for a month now, seems pretty good, buttons feel well made and robust. You can definitely feel the size difference when you put it on straight away, but definitely something that was easy to get used to after a few days. Just got to get your muscle memory adjusted. Very easy to function and set up your desired buttons as well with good short instructions.

  Bought ps4 back buttons attachment from the Sega Sykes seller for £29 plus 5 shipping I think so price was good, as close to RRP as possible compared to other sellers overcharging. It came quickly - on the ealier scale of the estimated delivery time. Package was new and properly sealed as expected.Product is official product by Sony and exclusively for ps4, it is good solid quality. Buttons click nicely and are very responsive and erganomic.It will take time to adjust to using back buttons if it is your first time.

  Had this in for a few days now and honestly can't recommend enough. Anyone looking at scuff pads should purchase this as it is a fraction of the price and works perfectly. Amazing LCD screen and easy to use functions/profile setup. It is a little fiddly to get on but fits great once on. Super for FPS games. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a pro quality controller without having to change their controller.

  Took a lot of getting hold of and paid £9 above RRP for it but I must say it's a brilliant little add on for the dual shock controllers and a great idea, I have never liked having to click the analogue sticks for L3 and R3 buttons and now I have programmed this on to the back buttons.... The result is splendid! Looks like part of the controller once fitted as well.Excellent, 5 stars.

  This is a well made product, fits to my ps4 joypad perfectly and easy to program your custom buttons. As I've seen others mention this does take some getting used to as you have to adjust the grip of your fingers. I play COD Warzone and at first your brain and muscle memory will not know what to do with your fingers, this however will pass and I'm already getting used to the adjustment now after less than a week. Great all round product, really happy I didnt pay £180 for a Scuff.

  OJO! La salida del audio solo servira para los controles de segunda generación! Excelente articulo para mejorar tu juego! Lo compre más que nada para mejorar mi juego ya que estoy jugando más competitivo. Juro que piensan que uno juega en PC y es super practico para poder dominar más tus jugadas de preferencia, (bunnyhop/dropshot). Tardas un poco en agarrarle la onda pero es simplemente memoria muscular. Yo le agarré la onda en dos días. De verdad que lo recomiendo!

  Whilst I've only had this a short time, and I have noticed right away that my brain will need reprogramming after many MANY years of not having back buttons, once I get the hang of using these buttons in the thick of the action, they're going to be extremely useful.

  日本版を発売日に予約して購入しましたが、リビングと自室に2台PS4とPS5があるためもう一個欲しくなったのですがご存知の通り転売屋ばかり。地道に探していたところこちらの海外版の製品を見つけ値段を見ると3700円ほどでした。定価2980円に消費税で3300円弱、それに送料と考えれば妥当かと思い購入。10日くらいかかりましたが無事到着、パチモンとかではなく純正でした。とりあえずこのボタンは最初全然慣れませんでした、でも3日目には慣れます。そしてなければ成績に影響するようになります、人間そんなもんです。FPSをメインでプレイするのですが、移動とエイムに使うスティックから親指を離さないでジャンプなりしゃがみなりを出来るのはかなり有利です。PS5でDualshock 4を使ってPS4のゲームをする場合でも問題なく使用出来ました、Apexで確認済。PS5のコントローラーに背面ボタンを付けなかったSONYの方針は愚かだと思います、振動にこだわってるくらいなら背面ボタンつけろよと。そして限定発売する意味もわかりませんけどね、こんだけ需要あるのに。

  Do not waste your money on this. While the premise is good and the product is well made, the buttons are too cluncky and while force you to use the controller differently. I played for a while and never got used to it, they made me worse.

  Il prodotto è originale Sony, funziona benissimo, i tasti sono reattivi e l’istallazione al controller è facilissima.L’assegnazione dei tasti del controller ai due tasti dello scuf avviene in maniera facile e rapida tramite il display posto al centro: si tiene premuto per qualche secondo e si entra in modalità per scegliere quale tasto assegnare.Il problema, secondo il mio modesto parere, è che i tasti dello scuf sono leggermente alti.Cerco di spiegarmi: quando si mantiene un controller i due indici sono su L1 e R1 mentre i medi sono posti al di sotto degli analogici per avere una presa più salda del controller. Capita inevitabilmente, mentre si preme l’R3 o L3, di premere i tasti dello staf per mantenere meglio il controller poiché sono posti proprio al di sotto.Se fossero stati più sottili probabilmente questo problema non si sarebbe verificato.Sto provando a fare pratica rendendo attivo solo un tasto ma purtroppo faccio fatica.

  Es una opción económica para tener dos botones traseros, sin embargo no los uso ya que son bastantes gruesos y para la manera en que sujeto el control ( doble claw) no me resulta  cómodo así que preferí no usarlos. Pretendía jugar claw con la mano derecha y usar el boton trasero izquierdo con la mano izquierda. Si no juegas claw y sujetas normal el control usar este accesorio puede ser útil, pero no te ofrecerá la misma movilidad que jugar claw o con teclado y ratón.

  This was a good idea, but released too late in the PS4 life cycle. It does add significant bulk which takes some getting used to.Easy enough to program the paddles, however it would be nice if you could program it to activate multiple buttons at the same time.Would also be more useful if the screen faced upwards and could perhaps be programmed to display useful info. However I suppose it would be hard to do so without it being intrusive to the controller.

  Ero intenzionato a prendere un aim controller serio su altri siti, prima però ho voluto testare se facesse per me questo tipo di configurazione, devo dire che per ora uso questo tutte le volte che mi accingo alle mie sessioni di gioco (per la maggior parte sparatutto) dopo il primo periodo di incertezza perchè ho dovuto cambiare completamente la presa del pad ora non riesco a farne a meno, si possono configurare i tasti in maniera semplice e la risposta è ottima. Il vantaggio ulteriore  è dato dal fatto che se il controller dovesse rompersi, oppure come me, ne possiedi più d'uno, puoi spostare l'adattatore velocemente quasi quanto monti le cuffie sullo stesso

  Es un buen producto, he usado un control con botones traseros anteriormente (powerAspectra), por lo que acostumbrarme al accesorio no fue difícil, recomiendo que además usen un software para reprogramar botones, ya que yo disparo usando el botón R1 no R2, eso hace que el control se sienta mucho más cómodo en tus manos, no tan grueso, además de que el botón R1 es más responsivo que el R2 ya que el rango de movimiento para que se active es más corto debido a que R2 es un gatillo, por lo que hasta sentirás un poco menos de input lag al disparar.

  Fairly expensive for what it does and adds weight to your controller. Moreover it will play with your muscle memory where you'll need to adjust. Don't confuse this with pedals found on the expensive controllers which are far easy to use IMHO. Moreover this will NOT be compatible with the new ps5 controllers. So not worthwhile investment if you're moving to Ps5 like me.

  Gostei do produto. Simplesmente cumpre com o que promete. É leve (não pesa o controle), é original (o que pra mim é muito importante). A tela não é touch, o que não dificulta o manuseio.  E apesar de pequena é justa, mostrando com definição as escolhas dos botões.Único ponto que achei ""negativo"" é que o controle fica sem pegada, porque fica mais ""gordinho"". É necessária uma certa adaptação.(Vim aqui posteriormente aos testes pra dizer que depois de adaptado, o acessório é sensacional. Demora uns dias até pegar o jeito. Depois, só vai).Aprovado!

  コネクタは動きます。取り付る前に確認してみてください。動くことが分かっていれば簡単に取り付けることができると思います。フォートナイトに使用しました。いままでほぼ初期のボタン配置でプレイしていましたが、本製品が安くなっていたので買ってみました。ジャンプを左裏、編集を右裏に設定してみたところ一部の操作はすぐに上達？しました。縦積み、横っ飛び、ジャンプしながら撃つという部分は圧倒的にうまくなります。階段→屋根→編集→階段も慣れれば楽にできそうです。ほかの部分で下手になった部分がありますがすぐに慣れていきそうです。私は人差し指でL1L2R1R2、中指で裏ボタンをおしています。たまに中指と人差し指の区別がつかないときがあります。長年ゲームをやってきましたが人差し指と中指を独立に動かすことが無かったので。。脳トレにもなっていると思います。

  2週間ほど使った感想ですが、買って正解でした。機能もシンプルで分かりやすく、押した感触もマウスのクリックの感じで押したことが分かりますしし、3パターン保存しておけるので、設定1はAのゲーム、設定2はBのゲーム、設定3はプライムビデオ用に片手操作設定、等分けられます。設定の変更も簡単で文句なしです。ただ、この製品は北米方面で売られているもののようで外箱と説明書等は英語でした。製品自体にかわりはなく、気にならないのであれば購入してみるのが良いかと。当方、APEXとDestiny2というFPSをしておりますが、両方ともアクション性が強く使うボタンも多くてお世辞にも強いと言えない私は同じ時期から始めた友人に比べて伸び悩んでいました。地力もほぼなく、レレレ機動に屈伸撃ち、出来れば撃ち合いで有利になるテクニック、そもそもFPSのセンスが無いとまで言われた私ですが、背面アタッチメントのおかげで幾分かは撃ち合いが楽になりました。いわゆるモンハン持ち等もせずデフォルトの持ち方で使っており、慣れた持ち方を矯正する必要もなく凄く楽です。慣れるまでは使わなかったり、間違って押したりと暴発しますが慣れると元々あったかの様に馴染みますのでおすすめです。撃ち合いに多少でも勝てることが増えたお陰でモチベが無くなる事もなく、毎日楽しく練習しています。また、FPSやアクションゲームのお供としても良しですが、私が気に入っているのは左のトリガーを○ボタンに設定し左手で左スティック又は方向キーー、そして決定を出来るようにしてNetflixやプライム、YouTube等の動画サイトを片手で観れるのもお気に入りです。片手に飲み物を持ちながらリモコンを操作する感じで使えるので凄くいいと思います。ぜひ試して頂きたいです。

  海外版で少し困惑したが使ってみれば普通に良い！嵌め込みが個体差か知らんがすごい力で入れなきゃならないから不安有りだが正常に作動。手大きい方じゃないしプロコン慣れしてるがこの背面ボタンは少し持ち手が窮屈に感じました、ガチンコでやる！ってのには向かないかもしれないが普通に遊ぶには大満足です！設定も簡単だし次のps5までの繋ぎコンにはこれで十分！

  並行輸入品と言うことで、品物に関してはここに書く迄もなく、他者レビューにもある様に外箱やら説明書は英語…それ以外、商品レビューやら使用・設定方法はWeb上にいくらでもありやすが…そちらを観るまでも無く簡単設定操作なので以下↓…。  装着後ディスプレイをポチ～～っと長押しでの設定…を×3設定記録可…ポチポチと2度押しで設定×3の切り替え…以上！w参考迄に(以下本題?w)…当方の購入時価格は国内正規販売価格(SONYstore等)に￥400強の上乗せで、並行輸入手数料と考えれば妥当(送料はprime対象で￥0)と思い購入…倍の値段で出品販売してやがる転売ヤーと比べる迄もなく良心的かと。…がしかし、発送完了通知が来て、そこから商品ページにとんだところ…価格値上げw同商品の場合、違う業者にリンクしたりするので単純に値上と言えぬやもしれぬが??…当方はあくまで上記価格(＋￥400強)にて購入…。

  海外の物(説明書が英語と仏語のみだったのでヨーロッパ)とは言え純正品をこの値段で買えて良かったです。慣れるまでは背面のボタンに違和感を覚えますが、慣れるまでです。快適に使えてます。聞いた事の無いメーカーの物が4、5千するのを考えると問題なく許容出来る価格だもと思います。

  初めてこの手の拡張機器を使ってみたが、思っていた以上に使いやすかった。特に設定が楽なところがいい。パソコンなどに接続する必要もなく、簡単に設定ができる。設定方法は動画検索でさがせばすぐにわかりやすいものが見つかる。steamのゲームでも問題なく使用できた。この点も好印象。惜しいのは生産数のみ。結局限定販売で終了。公式からはもう購入できない。PS５に力を入れたいのはわかるが、発売するからには欲しい人にある程度いきわたるぐらいの数を用意してほしいところ。ていうか、PS５も全然買えないし…。もちっと頑張ってくれソニー！

  日本で発売された時に買えず、諦めていました。Amazonで海外版を見つけ、少し不安はありましたが、同じSONY公式製品とのことで思い切って購入しました。購入から3ヶ月ほど経過しましたが、耐久性は問題なく、操作に関しても初めは苦労しましたが、使用開始から1ヶ月ほどで慣れました。今では無意識に背面ボタンを使っています。買って良かったです。

  APEXで使用する為に購入。北米仕様で説明書が英語ですが設定は簡単だし、もし分からなくてもYou Tubeに動画があるので大丈夫かと。背面に今まで無かった厚みが加わり持った時にかなり違和感。操作も予想以上に難しかった。しかしこれは個人差あると思うので器用な人なら難なく使いこなせると思う。問題は、PCやPS4を起動してプレイする度に設定したボタンが勝手に変更されてる点。設定し直せば大丈夫だけど少し面倒。返品交換するほどの不具合じゃないのでとりあえずそのまま使ってます。

  説明書に日本語は書いておらず、怪しいなぁと思いながらコントローラーに装着。面倒な設定もなく左が✖︎右が○ボタンになりました。変な遅延もなく問題なく動作しております。ボタンを押した感じもカチッという感じで使いやすいです。今のボタン配置を変えず、ジャンプとしゃがみを押せるようになり1対1では屈伸レレレをしながらエイムを合わせられるようになりました。ランクマッチで伸び悩んでいる人は買ってみて損はないと思います。

  例えばL2とR2のボタンをそれぞれ振り分けたとして、L2を押しながらR2を押してもL2しか反応しない。それ以外に欠点は無い十字キーの左右を振り分けるのが目的であれば、何ら問題なく使用できる。同時に押すことは無いのだから。
