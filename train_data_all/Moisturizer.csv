    Leaves white cast
  
",3.0,KAdams,"Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2019","









  
  
    
  I did not like the white cast this left. I'm not sure how to describe this but it never seemed to absorb into my skin. I could rub my face or neck hours later and I would have little pieces of product on my skin. I think I've read other reviews that mentioned pilling so I think that's what I experienced. I don't like wearing makeup every day but when I wore makeup it would cover the white cast. However the pilling still occurred. Otherwise, it seems to moisturize okay which is why I gave it 3 stars.

  This is very sticky and tacky, which should not be the case for a sunscreen with only an spf 30. No white cast and very nice ingredients, but doesn‚Äôt work well under makeup and makes my skin feel sticky and tacky for hours.

    White cast / not for acne prone skin
  
",3.0,K,"Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  a lot of people recommend this sunscreen because Cerave is a reliable brand but let me tell you this, if your skin is acne prone D O N O t buy this. I have pretty normal skin but I tend to get minor breakouts but this sunscreen amplified it. At first I thought maybe it was because I was using my normal lotion and sunscreen so the next day I decided to just put on the sunscreen. Big m I s take. ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢ I woke up with clear skin and by night time I felt like (and looked) like greasy 12 year old . *sobs* my clear skin . This might not be the case for everyone but If you have hormonal/or acne prone skin save your money.(also leaves a white cast)

  This lotion is great to wear for the daytime. At first application it feels a little greasy but after it gets absorbed you barely notice it. Keeps me hydrated and soft all day.

",3.0,fightyoctopus,"Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2019","









  
  
    
  I love the PM version and use it daily, but I'm not a fan of this. Very chalky, moderately bad white cast, and I feel like it just sits on the skin for a long time. Using the amount necessary to actually get the SPF coverage feels gross. I'm using mine up by using small amounts thinned with a hyluronic acid toner or a few drops of squalane oil and also using a separate sunscreen. In the future I'll stick to the PM formulation.

  I‚Äôm a long-time user of CeraVe products, and this is a good addition to my collection.  I much prefer having lotion with spf rather than dealing with two separate products.  This one gives me the impression that the gazillion lines in my face are a little less obvious‚Äîwhether they are or not is, to be honest, pretty immaterial.  I will buy this product again.

  I ordered this after I heard rave reviews from dermatologists about this product. I also ordered it because I own a bunch of other CeraVe products which I love. I switched from an SPF50 Cetaphil face lotion for this one, and I'm sad I did.This moisturizer does NOT apply evenly and smoothly on the face... I don't know how exactly to describe it other than it looks like grease paint when applied. It curdles and when it dries, it flakes off making it look like dead skin. I'm sure the product does a great job of protecting against the sun and it IS good for sensitive skin, but definitely not on the face. I'm probably going to use this as a body sunscreen instead of a face moisturizer.

",5.0,Khanh Nghiem,"Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  I wish they would take out all the SPF ingredients in this moisturizer because the white cast is terrible and you have to rub it in, which is never good. If I need SPF, I would use the Krave Beet Shield. The US really needs to catch up with the rest of the world when it comes to UV filter ingredients. BESIDE THAT, this lotion is very moisturizing and really helped my skin produce less oil. I would overlook the debacle and give this a 5 star

  How to say my feelings about it,I like cerave brand, but not this lotion.  it is not good for me. I don‚Äôt know why the white mud will be rubbed after applying the face. I do think about may be because of it can not match my toner,but I do try 2 different toners and also try don't apply toners, the white mud still come out. I'm not have a sensitive skin,and my skin always healthy, I just want try a different facial lotion. I'm disappointed at this. Only one thing I feel good about Amazon service, I get a broken box lotion first time, the customer service sent me another one soon.

  I love all the other CerVe products I'v tried but this lotion tends to be heavy and pill up on my face instead of absorbing. Takes a little extra time to rub the pills off my face but I still use it because I want the benefit of ceramides in my SPF. There is no other equivalent on the market.

  This Product I would say is decent to good for a person who does not have sensitive skin, or acne prone skin. It does offer great sun protection, but it‚Äôs also a combination sunscreen, which my skin did not tolerate well. A few hours after applying the sides of my nose are so itchy and oily, and my face feels like it is slightly on fire the rest of the day , and my T zone is super oily. Granted, I do have oily skin, but I can tell when my skin is irritated, and when it gets irritated. So I‚Äôm gonna just completely go over to a zinc sunscreen, that is preferable paraben free. I love this company, they offer great products to a general group of people who want all of the bells and whistles when it comes to a moisturizer and cleanser or even a sunscreen. But, for my skin, I just can‚Äôt tolerate their products any more, and I have used this brand for over a year, maybe I‚Äôm sensitive to the Parabens in literally all of their products? I recommend Vanicream, much gentler compared to Cerave in my experience to fragrance, or Parabens ZERO irritants.

  I normally like this brand a lot so assumed this would be good. This does not feel like a moisturizer, it does not absorb well and pills up HORRIBLY on your skin. You have to barely rub it at all before it starts balling up. Forget trying to apply makeup over this. I'm sure the spf is effective enough but as a moisturizer? No. Very disappointed to have paid nearly 15 bucks for this.

  Okay so I love this cream. The reason for the docked review is because apparently since it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmoisturizer‚Äù I was reading from another party that it gives significantly less protection from the sun...I bought it solely because I love cerave products and needed an everyday sunblock so this seemed perfect. I guess I‚Äôm going to do more research but yeah the moisturizer and everything about it is great it‚Äôs just that I read elsewhere that you‚Äôll need another everyday sunblock with it, which defeats the whole purpose for me.

  CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizer is my 3rd favorite product in CeraVe‚Äôs facial product line-their Facial Cleanser for oily skin & their PM Facial Moisturizer being my top 2 favs. CeraVe is my go brand for facial products. With having oily skin & at one time acne, I‚Äôve tried many products, some good, some no good. I‚Äôve done a lot of research into what my skin needed for optimal look & health.  I‚Äôve always gone back to CeraVe. What they offer in their AM Moisturizer is gold for our skin. The 3 essential ceramides, niacinamide (B3-which helps build skin cells while protecting them from environmental stresses) & hyaluronic acid-which retains water to help the tissues in our skin well lubricated & moist as well as a ton of other benefits!) are 3 key ingredients our skin needs & is in this moisturizer. SPF 30 is a good amount of sun protection for our face. The lotion is scent free. The 3oz. bottle goes a long way for the price. This cream I don‚Äôt consider to be lightweight though vs. their PM moisturizer. It‚Äôs heavier. This is where it shows like it is more of a sunscreen cream vs. a moisturizer but it is doing nothing. This is the only downside for me with having oily skin. After cleansing & applying my toner & any serum I may use that day I apply this. My skin does react to it in a greasy type of way within 1 hour. That is if I put nothing over the moisturizer. To prevent this from happening I apply my favorite primer once the moisturizer has set in. Then I apply my powder, either loose or compact. Once all of that is in place I see no oil & I know my face has protection from the sun as well as benefiting from all that the moisturizer has. Since Winter hit & I‚Äôm not outside, some days never the AM I use the PM moisturizer which is much lighter. Overall this is the perfect moisturizer to entail into your skincare regime. I have it on my subscribe & save list so I save a little extra & order when needed. One bottle lasts me 3 months or longer. I hope this helps to give you an idea as to why this moisturizer is so good. Wonderful quality at an affordable price. Highly recommend!

  I have light, naturally oily skin so I'm pretty picky with moisturizers just to be completely honest here.The product itself applies like sunscreen: a white cream that you have to rub in and feels oily to the skin.

  That's what I said about the CeruVe serum.  And, NO, I do not work for CeruVe or any other brand of skin treatment.  I hate to repeat myself, so read what I said about their serum.  This is only the second moisturizer I've used that goes on white, disappearing in a few seconds.  Try this if you have sensitive skin.  My skin is only mildly sensitive, except for Strivectin, to which I'm violently sensitive.  Sun protection all day, unless, I suppose, you were to be sun-bathing, like we did as teenagers--at least my generation did!  I've spent an afternoon in and out of the pool with my granddaughters in Florida with no sun protection lotion on either face or body.  I applied CeruVe  moisturizer on my face in the morning.  My shoulders, arms, back and decolletee  burned quite red.  My face did not.  And I don't wear a hat!  This product has no scent.  So I had no allergic reaction to that.  When somebody walks by me reeking of over-applied 'perfume', I have to reach for my inhaler.  Oh, and, a little dab will do ya.  No need to slather it on.  overall, good product, good price.

  Application is extremely difficult. The thick texture prevent you to rub it in evenly, resulting in an uneven white cast. I personally don‚Äôt mind a mild white cast if it is even, but this product dries down into white patches and makes me look ridiculous. In addition, the thick textual also makes it more prone to balling up and pilling. I believe most people are buying spf moisturizers because they don‚Äôt want the hassle of applying subscreen in the morning. However, this product is just going to make your morning even messier.

  I have purchased this item from numerous stores in the past. It typically is sealed and the top is locked.  The box of this product was in perfect shape but as soon as I opened it and took the lotion out you could see the bottle had been dropped and had black scuffs all over. I looked inside the box to see if it was on the inside of the box but it was clean inside the box which means the product had to be outside to get those marks. Disappointed for an Amazon product. I will think twice before purchasing these types of products on amazon

  I've honestly been brand loyal to this product for at least 3 years if not more.  I think  I have fairly average skin, but I particularly love how well this lotion ""settles"" into my skin, and doesn't leave my face feeling wet or shiny.  Three pumps each morning is all I need - I don't use the PM in addition, and though it's clearly up for debate what percentage is owed to this product, I am genuinely constantly complimented on my skin and complexion and youthful experience....  and literally the only facial product I use is this moisturizer every morning  (actually, i wash my face with facial cleanser once a week, but that's it).I've had issues with other products running into my eyes when I sweat, but that hasn't really been the case with Cerave, although you can inadvertently rub it into your eyes at which point it doesn't feel great...My skin pretty much feels moisturized for the entire day after applying at ~9am.  Definitely recommend giving this product a shot.

  Not moisturizing enough.I've used other CeraVe products without any problems so it took several months before I realized it was this moisturizer that was causing the rash & stinging on my face & neck. Within two days of stopping the CeraVe the symptoms started to fade.On sunny days (in the mild Pacific NW, not the tropics) I had to add another layer of sunscreen.Very disappointed in this product. I wish I could return it as I probably used less than 20%.

  This really protects against the sun amazingly! The only problem I had is that the product left a white finish on my face and also it did not provide a lot of moisture. I use this product for the sun protection but I have to apply it directly after using my regular facial lotion since it does not provide enough moisture alone.  It is definitely a good product in preventing sun burn and sun aging but I hope CeraVe works on the formula to make it moisturizing and more of translucent finish.

There is definitely a white cast with gross residue if you don't apply this on wet skin. This moisturizer works fine, just make sure it's applied to wet skin since that's when it works its best just like any other moisturizer.

  This does moisturize my skin well, I like the consistency and smell too. I have really dry skin in certain areas(nose and forehead). I never used any moisturizer before so I bought this brand and cetaphil to try out and see what worked best. I used the cetaphil brand first and I got a very large painful bump on my nose, I thought it could possibly just be a coincidence so I quit using it for awhile and tried the cera v. During the time I used the cera v,  I didnt have any breakouts or anything. It moisturizes my skin pretty good too.  I figured I would try the cetaphil again. Sure enough the next day I've broken out on my cheeks and forehead! So I wont be using the cetaphil brand again. I'll stick to cera v for now. The cetaphil consistency was more like a cheap lotion. The cera v was similar to sunscreen. Both smell fine too. They have different ingredients, But basically claim the same thing. The cera v worked the best for my skin.

Also try to avoid the eyes area because it makes your eyes teary and itches quite a lot (I experienced it in first hand).Also it is way smaller than what I was expecting and let me give you an advice: this is a ‚ÄúTwo in one‚Äù product; as it is a moisturizer AND a sunscreen it means that in order to get the SPF that the packaging of the product is claiming you need to use quite a lot of the product because the sunscreen properties are diluted in the moisturizer and as it is this small you‚Äôll find yourself finishing the small little bottle in no time; so that‚Äôs something to keep in mind when you buy a sunscreen that has moisturizer in it.In my very personal opinion, you should go for a product that is moisturizer entirely as well as the sunscreen, don‚Äôt play games with sunscreen, it is one, if not the most important step on a skin care routine.

  The product arrived quickly and intact. However, when I went to use it thinking that it would be creamy smooth, it came out clumpy and non dissolved so I ended up looking like a mime. Shaking did not help, nor did swirling a plastic stick into it in an attempt to emulsify it. I like Cerave moisturizers, but this was very disappointing.

  I have combination skin and this was too heavy of a cream for me. I tried it because there were several beauty articles that recommended it, but I ended up washing it off because I feel like I had a mask on and my skin felt stifled. It leaves your skin looking shiny in an oily way. This might work for someone with dry skin, but combination and oilier, no.

    More Sunscreen than Moisturizer, Thick Without Penetrating
  
",2.0,Amber B,"Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  I normally love Cerave, especially their PM moisturizer, but this was a disappointment. The product leaves a heavy white cast that takes as long as body sunscreen to massage in. Also, I often combine moisturizers with other products, either mixing them 1:1 or applying them in rapid succession. This lotion is the only one I've tried that reacted poorly with even non-exfoliating serums, leaving small, rolled, white clumps that looked like dead skin. A few other reviewers posted pictures nailing it.It then leaves a dewy finish, but you can feel that's it's surface level moisture. When I wash it off with a gentle cleanser at the end of the day, my skin feels dehydrated as if I hadn't been using a moisturizer at all.The best I can say is that it arrived as described, with a full and undamaged bottle. It also didn't break me out, and I haven't gotten even a touch of sunburn with it on. But Cerave's ""Ultra Light"" alternative is twice as good and worth the price difference.

  I used this product for three days and by the third day I had to stop due to it doing the opposite of what I bought it for. It is a very thick formula and takes some work to rub it into the skin. I didn‚Äôt mind this too much because is did seem to create a barrier to protect my skin from the sun. However, on the first day of using it my skin became very dry and started to peel. Keep in mind I do have very sensitive skin. It‚Äôs just annoying to get a product that does the opposite of what I bought it for. It‚Äôs a shame because I had heard good things about this product. I thought I would share my experience, in case there any other sensitive skin peeps looking at this product. It‚Äôs been a week since I have stopped using the product and my skin is starting to get back to normal. I held off on writing a review because I wasn‚Äôt sure if this was what was causing the dryness at first, but after only another patch test I have confirmed that it was due to this product.

  I like having moisturizer with spf to shorten my morning routine. I have to rub this in for a minute or so to get rid of the white cast, but it does dissipate with rubbing/patting motions. It‚Äôs thick but not as moisturizing as I like, so I find myself using more product or adding a different moisturizer on top, which sort of defeats the purpose. It doesn‚Äôt irritate my sensitive skin whatsoever, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll repurchase beacause my dry skin needs a bit more moisture. If you are using this just as spf or have oilier skin than me, you would probably really like it. It‚Äôs a good product, just not for me

  I have hormonal, cystic acne (and taken pretty much every cream and pill for acne at some point) so needless to say my skin is now somewhat sensitive and prone to major outbreaks. My dermatologist has recommended cerave (as well as cetaphil) to use for everyday products such as face cleanser and lotions. This lotion doesn‚Äôt seem to cause any outbreaks (or make my face super red after application, which is so nice lol). Also, it is super light and blends in after application. Give it a minute or two after applying and it should be good! It doesn‚Äôt make your face smell like sunscreen either which is the only reason why I am still consistent with applying it. My boyfriend even commented on it, and said you could only smell sunscreen right after applying but a few minutes later he didn‚Äôt smell anything.

  I give this Cerave moisturizer an average rating because of its beneficial ceramides and sun protection. One star was deducted because it is so thick I've had to unscrew the top and remove the nozzle in order to use it. Perhaps it is broken  but it doesn't appear to be. The second star was left off because it does not play well with (some) serums, primers, foundation or other moisturizers.  Pulling can occur and I've had it turn into a white film that is hard to blend. On its own, so long as it is the only moisturizer, it is good. I do wish it had a higher SPF.

  As always, this company‚Äôs product is worth the money. Even on a cold windy day, it protects from wind burn.

It feels as if I am not wearing anything. Also, my usually shiny face is more matte even after 7 hours compared to when I don‚Äôt wear it.

  I've never had a problem with CeraVe products before but this was just beyond disappointing. It left a whitish residue on my face afterward and took forever absorb into my skin. When I looked at myself in a mirror in public it was visible which parts of my face had absorbed it and which didn't because part of my face was visibly lighter than the other. (My skin tone is light brown). Would not recommend. However, the CeraVe ""PM"" version of this product (without the SPF) is a lot lighter and works much better. If SPF is not a strong consideration for you, I'd recommend that one. If SPF is a priority, do not buy this product.

  This was recommended to me by my dermatologist, so I bought both this and the Cerave PM moisturizer. This sunscreen/moisturizer combo is simply not hydrating enough for dry skin, I had to add additional serums to make up for it. In addition, it leaves a white cast (not a very significant one but still). It's also pretty awful under makeup because it pills. My face always looks patchy when I apply my concealer/foundation over it, which doesn't happen when I used any other moisturizer.If your skin is combo/oily, and you're not wearing a good amount of makeup day-to-day, this is an okay option. Those with dry skin, pass on this. However, the Cerave PM is quite nice and hydrating!

  I didn't have any problems with a white residue and I do enjoy that this particular sunscreen isn't perfumed. However, I do have a terrible time with it pilling off when applying primer or foundation.  I've tried waiting 15 minutes before applying anything over it, but the product sometimes even starts to pill when I'm just trying to rub it in.

  I usually use EltaMD Sunscreen for my face and I love it but it's a bit expensive so I thought I'd try CeraVe as my dermatologist told me this was a great brand for lotions and had peptides, etc., and I'm so glad I did. It absorbs quickly and doesn't affect or bother my makeup application or look white-ish or weird. I can use it without makeup too and it looks great. Very effective for blocking the sun, as a runner I am out in the sun quite a bit and it's been protecting my skin very well. I love it and it's half the cost of EltaMD and I think a little larger size too!

  I have tried this moisturizer for one month so far. I have used it with the gentle face cleanser from Cerave.

  Cerave is a phenomenal brand that just SHINES in the eyes of dermatologists and consumers alike. And they did it again - they surprised me with how much moisture I can get out of a product that also offers a sun protection factor of 30.  I think the only complaint I have is that it leaves your face EXTREMELY shiny, but that‚Äôs an easy fix with some oil absorbing sheets or even a very gentle pat here and there with a soft paper towel.

  I was using a Neutrogena daily moisturizer with SPF 35 but thought I'd try this product instead since I love all other things CeraVe. Keyword is definitely ""other"" in this case. Like many of the other reviewers have said, this product definitely leaves a residue on your skin after you apply it, and if you plan on applying anything else on top (like primer, foundation, etc), it will pill even more significantly. Also, the few times I managed to apply all my makeup without trapping the nasty moisturizer globs under my foundation, I noticed my makeup wore horribly throughout the day. For context, I've been using all my other products for years, and I'm used to how they should look after 10 hours of wearing them.So I would say if you're looking for a daily moisturizer with SPF to layer underneath primer/foundation/powder, LOOK ELSEWHERE. This product is probably work for you if you're going to be otherwise barefaced.That being said, the CeraVe nightly moisturizer is lovely, and I do enjoy their standard moisturizing cream as well as many other products. Not trying to hate on the brand, this product just didn't work for me.

  MANY years ago, a dermatologist recommended this brand and this product, and told me to stop wasting money on expensive moisturizers. I got hooked on the entire line of CereVe products after that, and have used them for more than a decade. They are all fragrance free, and all packages contain a lot of product. I always have extras on hand. Never want to run out. This one is nice because it's not greasy at all, but has great sun protection. Definitely recommend. I always thought high end (i.e. expensive) skin care was better and a must as we age, but this product renders my prior thoughts incorrect.

  Sadly, this doesn't seem to absorb into the skin-- a smooth white cast would be PREFERABLE because this is uneven and flaky, and it pills off.

It actually looks really nice on the spots where I manage to rub it in all the way - that‚Äôs where the caveat lies. This moisturizer is a nightmare when it comes to pulling and flaking off. It literally looks like I rubbed wet toilet paper all over my face with the amount of weird little white flakes and clumps that are all over my face. I have tried to use this moisturizer all types of ways to see if it was just user error - I have tried with and without other products underneath, I have tried rubbing and patting it in. Nothing stops the pilling and flaking from happening. I can‚Äôt even imagine how gross it would be if I tried to put makeup over this.

  This moisturizer didn't leave my skin feeling amazing like other moisturizers I've used in the past, but it's decent enough. It doesn't absorb right away, so rubbing it across your face will help. Plus, you might as well distribute it across your skin evenly.I mainly bought this moisturizer due to the SPF rating. It definitely smells like sunscreen, but it's not overpowering and it's pretty manageable. I would recommend not using too much of it, otherwise, it may leave your face looking a little white.

  So far so good...just purchased a month or so ago along with other products from the same line. My skin is looking so much better now than it ever has.  I have suffered with acne since a teenager and I am now 35. Doesnt make my skin greasy and can put makeup on with no problems.

    Invisible Zinc

  This is what my dermatologist recommended. It has zinc in it, which offers better sun protection, but it is light and doesn‚Äôt turn your face white. I‚Äôve been using it daily for several years and have never felt the need to switch to something fancier.

  I bought this as a daily moisturizer to apply under my makeup. It has awesome skincare ingredients which is what drew me to this product. However, this product does not blend into my skin. It will leave white streaks and the more I try to run it into my skin it will ball up. The past few times I‚Äôve tried using this, I‚Äôve had to wash my face and completely start over.

    No-go for my dry/combo skin
  
",3.0,Elizabeth,"Reviewed in the United States September 15, 2018","









  
  
    
  This formula rolls up when I try to run it in! If I don't rub it in, it leaves the classic zinc-sunscreen white residue. When I tried cutting it with a lighter moisturizer, still felt greasy for my dry/combo skin. On the up side, it was non-irritating, effective sunscreen and didn't clog my pores.

    HATE. Balls up and doesn‚Äôt absorb.

  I HATE this moisturizer. Every time I used it for a week it never absorbed and balled up and came off, I tried to wipe it off before applying make up and the rest of it just came off as applying my cream make up. It‚Äôs like a nasty sunscreen. I couldn‚Äôt figure out what was going on and came to read reviews and questions on here and see I‚Äôm having the same experience as many. Not even saving for below the chin, this moisturizer is more of a gross pain than any potential benefit.

  I like some Cerve products. This is not one of them. I have pretty dry skin and this product did nothing for me.  Might be fine for someone with normal/oily skin but definitely not for someone with dry skin.
