    Great product and Easy on the Wallet
  
",4.0,Amanda Osborn,"Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2021","









  
  
    
  I bought this product for my Son. He Loves it and said it has like a soft leathery feel to it, unlike the normal controllers and that its quite durable too. He Also stated he Would DEFINITELY recommend this controller to others.

",4.0,J.W. Stevens,"Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  After 125 hours with this controller I would recommend this controller, especially for the price. The whole point of this controller is to get the extra buttons on the back for a reduced price and in my case for racing. And for that it serves its purpose. The only thing I miss from my Xbox PC controller is the vibration on the trigger pulls. And I paid the same for the Xbox Pc Version, so I feel like they should have included it in this controller.RGB is fine, if you're into it, but I am not.If you can't afford the huge prices of premium controllers or the price you'd pay for any legit racing wheel,  this is a good compromise for your racing game.

  Directional stick went out a while ago so you can't stand still in game without involuntary moving. I put up with it for a while but then the right trigger literally stopped working completely. You get what you pay for I guess.

  I wanted to love this, having an LED machine, but the connection was unreliable out of the box. Despite checking all of the connection points, it was still losing power/connection halfway through matches. Had to switch back to my old Xbox controller.

    Really bad joystick drift after a month
  
",2.0,Stephanie George,"Reviewed in the United States September 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  My bf loved the controller when he first got it but after a month the joysticks have developed a really bad drifting problem. Its unusable for him at this point, during games he'd be aiming at an enemy and the controller would make his character look straight up or down. (Note: we also have never dropped the controller, or messed it up in any way. We keep it safe on our controller stand)The RGBs are cool though, it sucks that it was only usable for a few weeks.

    Brand new, faulty cord
  
",3.0,Dalen Monroe,"Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2020","









  
  
    
  I feel like any wired controller should have a wire that actually works. Instead i have to use a 2 foot cord rather than the 10 foot it came with because something inside of it is broken. The controller its self has no problems that i know of yet but this is aggravating when you are already too close to the screen for comfort. (using for PC not x-box)

  Do not buy this controller if you want to use it for PC. After setting up everything, calibrating, and troubleshooting for hours, the controller STILL has drift that won't go away. For $40 you think you'd get something that actually works. Will not be buying from this company again, don't trust their low quality products.

    Quality Controller at a Reasonable Price
  
",5.0,Sean E. Baldwin,"Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  I will start of saying that I had the previous model of the Spectra and loved it, came with my used Xbox One.  This enhanced model only serves to improve of that.  While you lose a little bit of the illumination and customization from that model but that's a small price to pay for the improvements.  The thumb pads on the sticks are raised and rubberized as most are but the recession where you thumb rests feels like it holds it place better than most.  All the buttons are responsive as anyone would hope and feel solid.  The addition of the adjustable trigger travel is a nice touch, though I haven't used them much.  The Advanced Gaming buttons are mappable to other buttons and take some getting used to in order to NOT accidentally press it when playing, they're a very light press to activate.Personally aside from the AG buttons being so easy to accidentally press if you have a button programmed to them, I have no serious complaints about this controller.  I'd always been a first party supporter when it came to controllers since so many 3rd party brands were trash.  PowerA really changed my mind with their original model Spectra and cemented it with the Spectra Enhanced.

  Bought this and thought this looked cool, seemed to be alright. Lights were cool. I've had it for about two weeks maybe and it already stopped working. I always worry when I buy electronics like this, some of them are very cheaply made. It only plugs in and that may be part of the problem, I don't know. Obviously kids cannot be relied upon to put things away properly, etc. But, i do know I only had this for about two weeks, and I did not see any kind of damage done to it at all and it literally just stopped working. Nice.....just wanted to warn others! It was plugged in to my xbox and that's where it stayed. Nobody threw it, or rage quit, or anything. It just stopped working.

Just plug it in and took off, easy to switch colors buttons and triggers all responsive and feel and like the feel of the controller in general as well.

    FABRIC WIRE PROBLEMS
  
",1.0,KenDaWindowMan,"Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  I am 100% willing to change this review to a 5 star review because this product is absolutely wonderful the buttons board from maize in the controller white of features a beautiful the controller. The feel of the controller in your hand is very good. But after using this thing now for about a month the wire seems to have gone badd. It's a simple USB cable with the bottom groove cut out for the connector port. But I just cannot understand why it would go bad and under a month. I think and make this right by sending me a new cable. My last xbox controller that I got had a fabric cable also and it went badd within 2 months.

  the controller was great while it was working, there is a good feeling when you press the buttons and they are overall fairly silent, however the RB and LB buttons are made extremely cheaply and are the only buttons not replaceable on the controller. within a month of owning the controller the RB button stopped working completely. i figured i must have dropped the controller or just got a dud and got it replaced. now a month and 5 days after received the replacement the second controller had the same exact issue. RB button stopped working. I now have to go through the headache of warranty replacement so soon after getting a second device. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID.

",5.0,Wilmer,"Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  As a competitive battlefield and callofduty player this controller is extremely well made. Besides the flashy lights and the back programable buttons the stick response is absolutely on point.I have owned two razer wildcats , a razer wolverine , and an elite. All these controllers have stick drift if you set in game setting deadzone to zero. The power a spectre does not. I updated the firmware since I saw some people having issues with the microphone and I have no issues so far. I hope it last and will purchase a second controller since I wear mine out fairly quickly. I have never aimed this well with a controller since my razer wildcat broke unfortunately it was discontinued.

The Xbox doesn't even register that anything is there. I followed all the troubleshooting and that made it worse. Tried contacting company, they sent me the same regurgitated steps to ""fix"" it. All those did was make it even worse. To fix the damage the controller did I had to reset my whole computer. I will never buy this brand again. I will only be using Microsoft and PDP controllers.

",2.0,G.D,"Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  Pros :The controller feels very nice and is easy to take apart for DIY repairs, way easier than the official MS controllers.The cable is long and does not twist around itself.The trigger pads are nice and work well the lights are a nice touch.Cons: I have had two controllers and one of them broke within a month by the RB button not working with no discernable reason as to why even when I opened it up. I first noticed it when playing COD Warzone.  The plastic just would not bend correctly anymore.The second controller I had broke within 6 months this time it was the LB button and/or the Left Stick. I noticed the second one was broken when playing  Saints Row 4 and noticed that the character would not sprint nor fly correctly and I noticed some stick drift during the forced slow moving sections.I rate it at two stars because if two controllers break within 6 months I refuse to believe I had two lemons but rather that the controller design itself is not very good. When you first use it, everything feels just right and at times it will feel even better than many other controllers, the finish on top has a very nice smooth feel to it. But I always valued utility over aesthetics, and if the controller breaks there is no utility to be had.

  Really good controller, but headset microphone is very quiet when plugged in.  Tried on different controllers, and it works fine.  After reading more reviews this is an issue with this controller.  To bad, because its a really good controller.

  When i first opend the Amazon package I noticed the box to the control was torn. When I opened the box further and looked at the control I am mediately saw the analog sticks had a white crust on it and the whole controller looked greasy and used. And the controller had a terrible smell like Cheetos or something else.

  Have had the controller now for over a month.  My initial reaction was all positive.  Its probably one of the largest xbox controllers.  The RBG is nice but not necessary.  Around the one month mark I noticed the right stick had drift.  It was annoying but hey... its a $40 controller.  But since then the drift in the right stick has gotten much worse and now the left is also experiencing drift.  I spoke to my friend who recommended the controller and he reported the one he bought for his son had the same drift problem, returned it for a replacement and hasn't had a problem since.  So I'm willing to try the replacement option.  I'll update once I'm one month in with the replacement.UPDATE:  So far the replacement has held up.  It isn't the quietest controller (clicky) but its pretty good considering how inexpensive it is.

  So you can look at this in a good way, or a bad way. This controller has lasted as long as an official Xbox controller for me. That would be 1 year, using it 1-2 hours per day. But now the trigger doesn't quite work properly. The analog stick is very squeaky and doesn't quite point in the correct direction.  The directional buttons don't work 100% of the time. This won't work for the games that I am currently playing, and I'll have to get a new controller now.I'm not happy that that's all this controller will last for. I don't want to have to pay every year to keep playing games. But maybe that's all that you can get. So if you want to pay a little bit less for a controller that will eventually break like all the others, this is a fine choice.

  I play a lot of Apex legends, so I got one of this controllers because of its back buttons. The back buttons work just fine. However, these controller have a fatal flaw.

  LB and RB are wider than on the microsoft controller. I keep hitting them by accident.Didn't last long. After about a year I started having issues with it. Trying to recalibrate it is a joke. Kept losing calibration and additional buttons on the back eventually wouldn't work and required reprogramming only to fail in a matter of seconds. Frustrating. At this point the reason I bought it (the rear buttons) is useless. Updating did not help only made things worse and you cant rollback update either. what a joke.Would not buy again. Pricey for a wired controller and didn't last long with fairly light gaming. Original xbox one controller lasted me 2 years, this one failed in less than 1 year.

  So I got this controller back in November and its been working great. Really nice build quality and the lights are nice to have. I just built a new PC and was having fun playing a few 3rd person games.I did run into an issue though. After 3 months of use, the left thumb stick started to become tied to the right thumb stick controls as well.  So for instance, you walk with left and controller the camera with the right. Well now you control walking and camera movement with left thumbstick; which you can try to combat this with using the right thumbstick to correct the camera but its just becomes annoying at that point. I've also tested it in multiple 3rd person games like Rdr2, gta V, and Assassin's Creed Odyssey and they all run into the same problem.Who knows, maybe I just got an unlucky product and should just get another one. Its still a good controller despite my personal experience.

  For the price of the controller it is definitely worth it. Has paddles that are removable and is a nice feature for 2 reasons,not playing a game that needs them you can take them off to be out the way. And 2 because of for some reason they break or something maybe thay could be replaced? Not sure if they sell just the paddles but I imagine they do. Paddle layout is perfect for me and triggers feel nice and responsive. The feedback in the paddles is a nice touch for some games. I personally like it for racing games. But this controler truly shines in FPS games. I play on PC and wanted a good wired controler like a Scuff without breaking the bank and I am glad to say that I found it! Ive had it for 1 or 2 mounths and it still feels like new to me and I play around 4 or 5 hours a day sometimes more. Highly recommend this controler!

  This is a great controller but it has its flaws. I am currently on my second one within a year. I play fps games (mostly Apex Legends and Warframe). First one, the left analog stick became loose and movement became uselessly non stop. Standing still wasn't an option. It was under warranty so I contacted PowerA and they sent me a new one no problem. The second one is starting to do the same thing. I don't know if this is a design flaw or if I am rough with the controller but I haven't had these issues with my Xbox controllers and they are 3 years old. This has all taken place within 7 months.PowerA has great customer service and response time but I'm not sure about the durability.Other than this issue the controller is solid and feels great. The extra buttons on the bottom are in the perfect spot and the trigger stops work quite well. I am happy with all of this, just not the analog sticks.

  The lights are cool. And the controller works but... The trigger button have a short throw ( compared to a normal Xbox1 controller) in that if you do many racing games you might need to adjust the dead zones The light work as you would expect.  Out of the two we bought we had one that developed a bad spot in the cable. This would cause the controller to disconnect. Bad new is I can't replace the controller and I can not find a way to ask to get it replaced from the manufacturer. Good news is it will work with a normal Micro-SD cable. But I suspect the "" 2 year warranty"" is only for a selling point and not reality. So if the controllers fail they will most likely be trash.

Insanely annoying if your Sprint in any game cancels when you stop moving, which is a common feature.)I may end up replacing parts, but for its price and features, worth it (even if you end up buying aftermarket parts).

  This controller worked great for about 4 days. Then, the joysticks started going haywire (spinning in circles with no actual movement), and button presses started only intermittently working. I plugged the controller into a different computer, same result. I went to PowerA's website and saw that there was a firmware update, but the update continually failed halfway through and then fully bricked the controller.I emailed PowerA and was told to return it to Amazon. When I told them that I no longer had the package as someone had inadvertently threw it away, they said that if I sent some photos and some other information they would escalate it for a warranty replacement. However when I did this, I was just told again that I had to return it through Amazon. After this, I purchased a Microsoft controller and this one joined the other trash at the local landfill.

  So L2 and R2 upon pressing would activate and quickly deactivate, as if there's a contact within the controller that is faulty. The rest of the buttons were pretty responsive, a little too much though. The dpad suffers from rolling inputs really badly, so it's possible to go from left to down lefto r up left with the tinniest press. Not recommended for precision such as speed running. Tried this with Celeste and Super Metroid. Again, couldn't even control in Celeste cause the default grab buttons are on triggers, which both either worked, or didn't at all. It was very easy to mis direction when trying to go fast. Look elsewhere if you are looking for acurate inputs. Not worth the 2 week wait for shipping despite being in stock.

  For the first two months of infrequent use, this was a very good controller, worked well, nice joysticks good button feel. then the left joystick started acting up, and nothing I did, including taking it apart to clean / repair it as a last resort and putting it back together again fixed it. left joystick would become unresponsive when going ""forward"" making games next to impossible to play with it due to the frustration of start and stop movement whenever you went directly ""forward' with the camera. It's a shame, as for the price point, the controller seemed much better than it's competitors, but If it couldn't stand up to even a few months of sporadic use, any one who plays games with it more than once a week or so for a few hours won't get much time out of it before it breaks itself. I threw the damn thing in the trash and Won't even be looking for a refund, I just want to be done with the frustration from what seemed like a very nice product but turned out to cause annoyance and aggravation instead of aiding in  enjoyment and relaxation.

  Been using it a few weeks now and I have no issues so far.As others have said, it works on Windows 7 if you manually install the driver and can manage to find the category with the ""Microsoft Xbox One Controller (DFU)"" drivers. They seem to be in different driver categories for some people.Somehow the grip buttons became ""A"" buttons, but it's easy enough to get used to avoiding pressing them. Same with the LED and Turbo functions. I dont use grip buttons or turbo mode, so I can't really speak for those in this review.The only part that doesn't quite work for me is the trigger ""priming"" adjusters. I can only get the trigger to detect a complete press when the trigger can depress fully. It doesn't seem to alter the range or sensitivity of the triggers as I expected it to, it only ""locks out"" the complete range of the trigger....and I can't think of any use for such a feature.I would rate it five stars, but the trigger prime/lock thing is just odd to me.

",1.0,Andre B.,"Reviewed in the United States March 21, 2021","









  
  
    
  I can't stress enough how excited I was when I received this controller in the mail. I've been looking for a controller to replace the $13 Xbox 360 controller I bought for my PC some time ago. Using it for my PC means I don't really have a need for a wireless controller and prefer a wired one in this setting, but wired controllers typically aren't built as well, nor to the have the weight of a wireless controller in this day and age.I was pleasantly surprised by the all around quality of the controller and weight of the controller as well as the sticks...for 15 days. The right stick just completely failed in the middle of a game and no longer functions. I've had this type of breakdown occur in a cheap controller after years of use, and the sticks are typically where you feel the ""get what you paid for"" element of a third party controller, but 15 days is absurd.I'm not very hard on the controller and don't use it for every game, so it's pretty surprising to see a stick just break like this after little more than two weeks of use. Huge bummer because I did like the controller while it worked and had recommended it to a couple of friends.

",4.0,Chris B,"Reviewed in the United States December 11, 2019","









  
  
    
  Love this controller, no dead zones out of the box, no stick/button input lag and some decent color options. The mic input volume issue, which is noted in other reviews is what makes this 4 out of 5 along with a trigger response issue when the variable setting is at anything but max. I got around the mic issue by maxing out mic response in audio settings on the xbox. For the price though it's great, would recommend.

  I've put in a lot of hours on this controller for about a month and it's worked well.  The D-Pad functionality is not perfect but I don't have a huge need for the D-Pad for the third-person shooter game I mostly play.  The best part about the controller is I don't have to worry about batteries and the cord is very long so there are no mobility issues.  The changing LED lights are pretty cool too.Update: My dog chewed through the usb cord up near the micro usb end.  If anyone knows where I can buy the same usb cord replacement let me know. I can‚Äôt find a replacement to buy anywhere.

    Drifting after 7 months and mic input not working
  
",3.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States November 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was super excited when I first received my enhanced controller. The selling point for me was the programmable buttons on the bottom which meant no more claw grip when playing Fortnite. It was a game changer for me. However,  recently the right joy stick has started drifting. The mic input also flickers on and off.  I play everyday so I was hoping this controller could go through the paces. I believe that the Red Dead fishing really put this controller to the test but it failed miserably.  Although, this is a great cheaper alternative short term in the long run you could be paying as much as a quality $200 dollar scuf or xbox elite controller.  I will note I'm a casual player but I play a lot so I felt the more expensive controller purchase would be overkill. Now I don't think that and will be looking into the scuf.

  I got this controller as a gift at Christmas. Loved the lighting scheme, the programable buttons were a nice addition and for the first 2 months, this controller was great. First the buttons I use most frequently (the A button and the right programable button) began to stick causing a noticeable difference. I cleaned the controller thinking that it might help and for a day it did make a small difference. This month the right stick is now beginning to stick causing it to get stuck in the upward position.I am particularly good at taking care of my controllers, disks, and console. I have had stock controllers that have been used for 4 years work better than this one currently after 4 months. I am extremely disappointed with the lack of quality this controller is showing. The quality they put on the aesthetics does not match the quality of the internal mechanics of the controller. Do not fall for this gilded controller.

  This is a solid xbox one controller, the rgb doesn't go all the way through the grips, but it's good around the buttons/analog sticks/d-pad. it's cycled through a button on the bottom, so if you have bigger hands you may accidentally press it(i have at several points). Also the way the trigger adjustment switches work is they just weaken how it broadcasts to the game, rather than actually making it take more force, so those are kind of useless because the game may not recognize that the triggers are being pressed. All in all, I have no complaints now that i've gotten it set up the way I want, and i'm glad I was basically able to save 20 bucks compared to getting a new xbox one controller, and trade the wireless capability I wouldn't have used for the rgb on this controller.

  So there have been several great reviews that have delved deeper into things like sensitivity of the joysticks and the like so I'm going to pass on going into that area. All the buttons and the joysticks have a nice feel to them and work very well. You can tell these aren't flimsy things that will start sticking or breaking in a month or two. I also love the mappable buttons on the back, I've assigned one to the ""A"" button which I commonly use in many games and has worn out on several controllers. That way if the rear button fails I'm only out the rear button. I'm also really loving the cable, very nice cloth braided cover and the security clip going into the controller is awesome. Seen way too many times of someone passing a controller with the cord and then popping off to smash on the floor. Really liking this controller a lot and hoping it will last a good long time.

    Everything You'd Need and Like But PC Gamers Beware...
  
",4.0,Tien N.,"Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  I use this controller on PC for games that are too difficult/annoying to play on mouse and keyboard. Everything works fine. I like the extra features it has and the RGB lighting. It has a nice feel to it too and it's sturdy. The problem that I have with it is that it keeps my computer from turning off the monitor or from sleeping. If I disconnect it, then those functions work fine. I've read that many gaming pads have this issue though. I hope the developer and make some sort of custom driver for this because it really is a great controller. Simple, but advanced, and elegant.

",5.0,Nicky Mase,"Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  This controller actually surprised me. I've read a lot of different reviews on it before I actually decided to buy.  I personally didn't want to venture outside of the official xbox controller realm, having owned some pdp controllers in the past, which to me always had chinsy build quality. So I usually stay with old reliable official hardware. Because of the current pandemic though and the unavailability of various products, good xbox controllers in my case, I decided to settle on this product, only because it had decent reviews and yes the rgb was a nice bonus. When the controller arrived I was honestly stunned. The packaging was high grade, the controller felt solid, good sticks, buttons and triggers. The matte black finish is smooth and doesn't show fingerprints. So all around this product is really solid. When gaming its very responsive and comfortable. The only caveat is that it's wired but for me it worked out well due to the long braided cable and that I usually only play on my pc.  The quality of this controller exceeded my expectations; Solid build quality with bright rgb lights which can be changed to solid colors makes this an overall great buy if you're looking for a more affordable alternative that actually works and fits that true gaming aesthetic. Buy it you won't regret it!

  This one works just as well as the official Xbox One controller in terms of stick accuracy and button response. The RGB is also very pretty and nice, helps provide a good mood. There's no textured grips, but that's OK. The braided cable is sufficiently long but a bit too rigid. Only thing I don't like is that the button controlling the RGB is right in the middle of the controller's underside, so most people will keep pressing it by accident. Otherwise a good purchase.

  I'm convinced these modern gamepads are just not made to last, or maybe last in accordance to how much they cost. I've had this for 2 months and it worked perfect until today. At first I thought the mapping settings had somehow changed but after using a config tool it seems to be a sensor or something. Anyway when you pull the R2 trigger it wigs out and causes the left analog stick to randomly go UP and then center back over and over eventually sticking in the UP position. In a game like FIFA you press R2 to sprint and your player sprints but also runs up. In a flying game you press R2 to accelerate, take off and it causes you to dive bomb straight into the ground. I'm not even going to bother with opening it up and fiddling with it, going straight into the trash bin where it belongs. It is a shame because the external build quality is great with a nice weight. The LEDs worked perfect and was very easy to program the extra buttons.

  UPDATE: After just a couple weeks the PowerA Spectra controller has become useless. The left joystick, after zero contact for an extended weekend (I was away from home and the controller wasn't touched in my absence) the left thumstick is now perma-stuck triggering right and up directions. The thumbstick itself is in a neutral position - zero observable damage and no off-axis tilt. It just doesn't work right anymore. I have a replacement controller coming my way. Hopefully the next one doesn't have this issue, or this will become a 1-star rating. Will update if the replacement doesn't pan out. I want to love this controller but if it's going to defect itself then it's no good to anyone. I had an issue with a PDP controller after a couple months where it just stopped working. My guess is that these third-party controllers just don't have quality parts in them despite how good they can look, including this one. A tip for PowerA: charge me an extra $5 if it means putting better parts in your controllers so they are more likely to last a year or more.Original Review: I've only used the controller for a few hours but so far, so good. The LEDs are cool - not a high part of function but it's nice to know you can glow a controller and always know where it is even in dark spaces. I had a PDP controller that I used for Rocket League because Elite controllers are grossly overpriced and both of mine started failing roughly a year in and were well out of warranty so I started shopping for alternatives. The PDP was nice for a short while but it eventually stopped working entirely. I'd seen PowerA and figured I'd give the controller a shot. For the Spectra, I can say that while I prefer wireless controllers a good wired controller can be a great asset - no batteries, no disconnects. The feels of the controller is actually quite premium given the more-modest price of $40.  I can tell there's not quite as much money spent on the controller with the triggers and buttons but it's mild differences between a good trigger and a great trigger. Nothing feels cheap so I would hope this controller will last me at least as long as my Elite controllers (at least I won't be irritated about a $150 controller failing after a year). I love the two programmable buttons on the back. I play Rocket League occasionally and got fully adjusted to triggers on the back of the controller to maneuver my car and without them I lose a lot of skill. These triggers, while not as nice as the Elite triggers, are simply and fully functional and are positioned properly so your fingers naturally reach them when needed. Overall a very good controller and under $60 so it's a nice value for what seems like a quality product.

  Mine came with stick drift on the left thumbstick right out of the box.  Also not a fan of the size of the thumbsticks, they are a bit too small making it harder to aim.  I also don't like how the bumper and triggers are located, maybe it's because I'm coming from a standard Xbox 360 controller but it's hard to switch from the bumpers to the triggers with just your index fingers, while that's easy to do on the 360 controllers. I do like the material on the front of the controller though, and the d-pad and face buttons work great, also like the RGB.  If it didn't have the stick drift I probably could have gotten used to the other issues but it's probably just best to go with an official controller.

  Got this as a cheap replacement to an OEM XBox 360 controller and was blown away. I thought it was going to be super cheap, light weight, and clunky feeling but got quite the opposite. This thing is heafty and tough but all the controls feel comfortable and responsive rather than spongy or stiff like other non OEMs.My only concern is really a pointless one. Id want some way to better control the LEDs and pick your own custom colors rather than using the preset, but that's just a personal want. Also the trigger adjustments are pointless but they're optional use so once again not really a negative point for it.

  I've been playing with this controller for a little over a month.Great controller for a low price. Extra buttons and trigger switches work great. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I can't mute my mic without manually disconnecting the headset or my microphone from my headset. I'm guessing this can be fixed with a controller update in the future.

  So getting this thing to work on my xbox was a pain. It initially didn't turn on or work at all when I plugged it in. So I tried to install firmware from my pc. It worked and had power initially, then I installed the xbox firmware and it stopped working on my pc. I tried it on my xbox, still no good. Did that a couple more times to no avail. So I installed the PC firmware and left the xbox firmware alone. This fixed the issue.It's easy to program and has been working fine so far. For $40 this is a great controller. MS controllers typically are pretty bad. The 2 buttons on the back are a really nice addition for the price. We'll see how it holds up.

  Controller came and it looked and felt great. The back buttons are easy programmable, and the lights look great. I just wanted a controller with rear buttons/paddles , settled with buttons cause I found this controller to be reasonably priced. Unfortunately after about 3 months of light use , the left stick has come lose and has a big dead zone , or want just loses moves your to the right. I would expect it to last a little longer , I‚Äôm not rough on controllers or anything , it‚Äôs adult owned never dropped or thrown, I use it and it gets put away , so overall product could be great if it was actually built to last, I‚Äôm disappointed.UPDATE - I was sent a replacement after 2 months of being told they would replace it. At least they replaced it free of charge but that‚Äôs quite a while. More so, after about a year with the new controller I‚Äôm having an issue with the left stick now. Where it cancels sprint or simply won‚Äôt work when I click it in. The first controller I had I‚Äôd say stay away , but for the price, features, customer service, and quality if you get a controller that will hold up it‚Äôs a decent deal versus everything else in the market.Updated to 3 stars

  I've had 2 different PowerA controllers - this one and the Fusion Pro.  I liked the adjustable trigger stops that these controllers offer and they work well enough while they last.  But, both of these controllers had the L3 button fail within 3-4 months of use, where the MS XBox controllers last me 8-9 months before they start to get stick drift.

  Was great until it stopped functioning. Left stick won't click anymore when moving forward. Which means any game that uses that function for sprinting is now unplayable. I can map the button to one in the back of the controller but it's highly inconvenient. Controllers cost a small fortune nowadays and they don't even last long. Bought mine in December and it's now May. Unfortunately with the outbreak I'm sitting at home much more often than usual and gaming was my only past time at the moment. Now because this controller let me down I'll have to socialize with family members and be more responsible.

  An okay controller marred by the insufficient customer support from PowerA and the flimsy thumbstick coating that came off after barely 3 months of use and then left thumbstick falls to one side not long after. Not eligible for Amazon return, so I went to power A who insisted they would get me a replacement. 6 months have passed by and they are still insisting they are on it. Such BS when the same product has been available on and off on Amazon multiple times during when I inquired about a replacement! Power A does not stand by their product and I regret buying this and you will too. But if you have to, I highly suggest buying a warranty on it to take Power A's excuses out of the equation.

  It is a nice controller and it looks good and feels good, but after a couple months of heavy usage the right thumb stick started to wear out and i was getting a lot of drifting with that thumb stick.

In first person shooters this can be extremely annoying and ruin your experience. If you are not someone who uses this daily and for extended amounts of time it will probably last you a while, but if you are planning on using it a lot, i would suggest staying away from this controller.

  If you can spare a bit more money, go for a wireless one. I wish I had. having to deal with the wire is kind of a nuisance. Otherwise it's a perfectly fine controller, functionally. Aesthetically, I would've preferred that the actual buttons illuminated, rather than the space around them. When you play in the dark, the LEDs make the controller look pretty, but it doesn't actually make the symbols/letters on the buttons visible.

  When it worked it was a great controller. But had a very weird issue, the right and left triggers stopped working in a game I was playing. Thought it was a issue with the game. Plugged in a different wired controller and verified that it was the controller. The PowerA controller used the same driver as the other controller that worked. Went to their website for support. Saw that there was a firmware update for the controller. Downloaded and installed the update, now my controller is bricked and won't even power on. Reached out to their support.

With that said I've had NO issues with it and would recommend it any adult gamer. It's dropped off my desk once or twice but that hasn't affected anything. The colors are pleasing and soft texture of the controller is comfortable. If you're looking to a solid third party controller this is definitely worth considering.

  Works great if you are OK with a wired controller. (I actually prefer the wired personally not to have to worry about connection lag or charging.) I have had and spent in my opinion on after market controllers with extra buttons used in fps  games. Further the quality of those controllers are lacking. (Looking back at the 4 Scuff controllers I purchased at $200 each which all broke after about 5 months each makes me disgusted at the waisted money and money given to a company which is all about marketing rather than quality)  Now I don't know how well this will hold up over time but after a month of use it feels and performs like it was brand new. Further at the price point even if it breaks you could buy 4 for the price of one of those competing ones.

  ¬†I've had this controller for a few weeks now and wanted to wait to write a review because a few people said theirs stopped working after a while. I use this thing quite frequently and it's without a doubt worth every penny. I love the feel of it (soft grip on the top) and although I don't use it, the sensitivity adjustment is pretty cool. I've got mine set to cycle through the colors because my mouse does and I'm just ridiculously infatuated by lights. This is absolutely worth the money and for a third party brand, it's impressive!

  I was initially looking for a replacement for a wireless controller that was acting up, and as I was browsing through the options and seeing how expensive they all were, I clicked on this one just to take a look.  What caught my attention was the programmable extra buttons under the handles.  I thought that was pretty neat, so I gave it a try.  I could not be happier with my decision.  Yes, you have to plug this thing in, but with those programmable buttons, I'll never play with another wireless controller in my house again.  I can't go without those buttons in certain games now.  I don't understand why they don't all have this, and why this one has it for this price.  I even bought my son one of those fancy modded controllers with rapid fire, which is neat, but I don't even want to use that if it doesn't have the buttons underneath.  I guess I could have added that feature to an already ridiculously expensive controller, but now you're talking like 3-4x the price of this one.  I'm happy with this one, and I never have to change batteries!  Oh, and the lights are pretty cool, too.

  I just recently started streaming on Twitch and have never owned a controller for playing specifically PC games before. I was playing The Witcher 3 and Remnant From the Ashes with my Switch Pro controller with some success, but transitioning from PC to Switch was becoming a pain, so I bought this controller just to play PC games.I had reservations buying a third-party controller, but this one is right on the money. It's plug and play simplicity. No messing around with Bluetooth settings or drivers. Plug it into a USB and you're off to the races.Pros:The outer shell material of the controller feels similar to a matt finish and feels great in my hands while playing for hours on end. I live in a hot climate so sweat sometimes becomes an issue when playing games with slick features, but this controller has no issues with that.The button on the back to switch between the various colors is neatly tucked away behind the back on the controller, and it's never an issue while playing games that require quick reaction times. Having the option to change colors is nice, but is purely a cosmetic feature.Cons:Despite feeling great in my hands, the controller can sometimes feel a bit light and frankly a little cheap in some areas. The buttons and triggers are responsive, but I feel like I have to baby them if I want them to last. (I'm protective of my gear anyway, but it's still worth considering if your the type of player who throws controllers). Some of the buttons on the back feel unneeded. I have no idea what the purpose of the T1, T2, and T3 levers on the back of the controller are used for, and the programable buttons, while an interesting idea, don't serve much of a purpose in my honest opinion.Conclusion:Finding first-party controllers during the era of COVID can be an absolute nightmare due to price gouging and supply scarcity, so if you want to buy a slightly less expensive alternative that simply ""works"" then this is the controller for you. This is plug and play simplicity at it's finest. If that's what you want along with some minor cosmetic flair, then I'd recommend picking up one of these puppies. If you want something with weighted buttons and more substantial-quality, then you may want to look eslewhere.

",2.0,Xavier,"Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2020","









  
  
    
  Upon recieving this controller and first impressions, it was really nice. However, not even 20 days after I started using the controller, (June 22nd to July 12th), the left stick has developed a pretty bad drift and the lights are dimming. I wish I could say that this controller is worth the price but it just isnt. I would instead reccomend is buying either an On-Brand Microsoft controller or a Scuf-Gaming Controller. A little more pricey than this PowerA controller but they last a TON longer than this.

  The controller arrived quickly and looked great with my PC setup, used only occasionally for certain games, but the right bumper broke within a few months. I reached out to the company saying I just wanted a replacement part but they didn't support sending any replacement parts despite how easy it is to take apart (which is very nice). I've tried to fix it with limited resources but found it difficult.Overall it's just not good hardware, buttons have flimsy triggers, probably better money spent buying from another brand.**EDIT: they ended up sending me a new controller which was nice, it took about a week and a half to arrive. Warranty seems to cover a good deal and the company seems to be responsive enough but if you don't want to just lose your controller for 2 to 3 weeks I'd still recommend shelling out the extra $20 to buy an xbox brand controller or something else more reliable.

  Honestly the controller has a very good build, but there are some areas where the controller lacks a little. The leds on the front they look good but around the parts you're hand covers most of the darker colors the remote can produce it lacks strength and is very dull, but some of the colors are less noticeable in this aspect. Another thing I don't like is the d-pad to be honest I hate it like why did you go with a mesheey one in stead of a clicky one I don't get it. But the triggers and the paddles work as instructed and works good so I give this remote a 4 and it has a lock on the cord which is the best and a break away cord so with that it is one of the best options if you don't play games like Mario or any that use the d-pad heavily so with that I end my review.

  I bought this controller a few months ago and have used it on my pc for games that just don't feel right to play using the keyboard. this controller continues to feel new as if it just came out of the box, and the backlit buttons are also super handy for playing in the dark. The triggers are also adjustable so you can change the feel depending on if your using it for a driving game or a shooter, but I have never really used it for a shooter so I can't really speak for whether its very great, but it is a nice feature to have I guess. Additionally this controller has held up to some light abuse, so if you are one to send your controller to the other end of the room I would just suggest taking it off the chord first so you don't damage your usb port.Aesthetically speaking this controller is really nice too because it has a matte finish which feels nice and grippy in your hands and it prevents it from becoming grubby over time from hand sweat or whatever. Also you can select the color you want between like 8 colors.In my own opinion this controller is better than those produced by Microsoft, and I haven't seen another third party controller that checks off every box quite like this one, so if I needed to buy another in the future I would absolutely buy another PowerA controller.

  This is an awesome controller! I generally dislike aftermarket controllers, but this one feels just as good as Microsoft's plus you get some nifty LED's. It comes with a long charging cable, which is nice for me because I use this for my PC and I don't have bluetooth. I'd say if you want to save a few bucks on an Xbox one controller or you want a good controller for your PC then this is a solid option.

  The quality of this controller is incredible including the usb cable, connector, etc. However, the L1 button quit working after two months of playing Rocket League. During the time it worked, the responsiveness, deadzone, and overall feel are equal to or better than first party controllers. Other controllers I've used (official xbox and ps4) lasted at least 6 months before something messed up. Disappointing lifetime for what seemed like high quality.

    Buy PowerA if you want headache!
  
",1.0,Alf,"Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  Update:I was able to contact PowerA customer support last year and I only got the replacement in late December/early January because of ""supply issues"". This doesn't change my opinion of this controller, I do not have the time to contact customer support every freaking month! I've spent longer waiting on the replacement than the actual time I've used this controller! I already bought Microsoft Xbox controllers and I will be getting rid of these PowerA ones. I am definitely never going to buy anything from this unreliable brand and will advise against it if ever my friends, family and coworkers are looking to buy 3rd party controllers.Original review:So I have only started using this in late September. Right now, this PowerA Spectra control is just a beautiful piece of junk in the middle of my gaming set-up. It just stopped working while I was playing Monster Hunter World. I was able to make it work after restarting but it happened again. After a few more hits and misses, I was able to upgrade the firmware while following the instructions on PowerA's website. Guess what? It still did not fix it and now my computer cannot detect it at all. I've tried several USB ports and still doesn't work. Other devices work on these USB ports. So in summary, don't waste your money on any of PowerA's devices. They barely have customer after sales support. Just buy the original Microsoft ones and save yourself the headache.

  I was Extremely hyped to order this Wired Controller when I first saw it and when It arrived it really lived up to its expectations, it had great working back buttons, trigger stops, and I loved the RGB. But not even 3 months into using it, it began to get some sort of stick problems that I haven‚Äôt seen before and I knew I haven‚Äôt been playing too rough with it because I‚Äôve only been playing Modern Warfare but each time I kept playing and trying to ignore the stick problem it got worse and worse and finally I could barely walk forward in game without it stopping out of no where. So I went and bought a can of compressed air to try and clean it but nothing worked so that‚Äôs when I gave up and began to write this review to express my thoughts on this controller. In my opinion I love PowerA‚Äôs Controllers put I think if your looking for a long lasting controller your looking in the wrong place, powerA‚Äôs controllers have a short lifespan (in my case) but they do deliver you a great short lived experience, I would recommend this product to many people but in my case I think it‚Äôll be best if you just got a certified Xbox Controller from Microsoft even if the price might be higher its still better than having it stop working in a few months and lose all your money. Thanks you for reading :)

  I've bought two, the first of which had a faulty left joystick after a couple of months. I thought, no worries, it's probably my fault for how I press / use it (it wasn't), and bought another one. After another 3 months, this one is also unusable. More often or not when I press/hold RT it triggers movement in my left joystick. My left joystick is also unresponsive in certain directions.I wouldn't buy this again.

  Got this controller on pre-order and I'm happy to say it's a winner! I wanted a wired controller just to have in case we ever had a problem with our wireless controllers. What a great find this is! Has a great feel to it and the quality took me by surprise. I did not have high expectation when I purchased this controller and I'm thrilled that it turned out to be a great purchase. My son loves it and he also really likes the ability to customize certain buttons. The changeable colors are nice and bright. None of the colors are muted. I took a picture of each color so you could get an idea of how they look. The yellow/orange color doesn't show up well in pictures but it is nice and bright like the others in real life. The colors are red, orange/yellow, green, light green(looks like the chartreuse color), blue, light blue(almost an aqua/cyan color), and purple. Hopefully, we will have no issues with this controller but if we do I will make sure to come back and do an update. For now, though this is a great controller and I recommend it.

  I have been using the Xbox Elite Controller ever since its debut. I needed a second controller but because of the current crisis the Elite controllers are sold out, I wanted an Elite 2. Since those were sold out I figured I would just grab a cheap one to hold over until things are back to normal. I got this one today and its great. The buttons feel good, its not light and cheap feeling at all, the cord is nice and its a design that you can tell they actually put some thought into. It has a lock on the connection to the controller end and a break away on the usb end. The rgb works great and really easy, it has 3 way trigger locks and 2 buttons underneath that IMO are much better placed then the Elite ones. I might actually end up using this one over my original Elite.

",1.0,Melissa Drennan,"Reviewed in the United States November 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  I really want to love this controller.  There are some really nice features on this controller.  The LEDs are bright and it's comfortable even though my hands are smaller, it feels soft and responds really well, the cord is sturdy and strong.  But there are just too many big problems that outweigh the good.First, the power cable cannot be removed from the port on the controller.Second, the mic doesn't seem to work regardless of what headset I try.And third, the biggest issue for me, the right joystick feels sticky and squeaks when being moved in any direction but the 10 o'clock position.I'm not particularly rough with my controllers, either.  This one was a replacement for the one that came with my Xbox One console that I had used for 5 years.  That one works fine still but had started going through batteries quickly, which is why I wanted to get a wired controller.  This one didn't live up to what it claimed to be.

    Prefer to the more expensive Fusion A Pro!!!
  
",5.0,Nicholas Cultrara,"Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  I prefer this Fusion A Xbox controller to its deluxe big brother (with four paddles). I found it too heavy and and large and for some freaky reason my hands would tingle and go numb when using it. This is the perfect size. I like that the paddles are built into the controller rather connected to a break out box or magnets. Also I found four paddles to be overkill and a it is a bit tricker to grip because of thier placement. 2 paddles are fine. My only gripe, I think the thumbstick tops are a bit small and I am going to try to correct this with thumbstick covers, I think that will solve the problem. This controller is half the price of its premium big brother and I find much more user friendly. The lighting is very cool and can be shut off at any time. (I would have removed the lighting around the frame of the controller personally). I only wish they had other colors than black, but I guess the figured the lights make up for that. Bravo Fusion A.

  I've gotta say this controller is fantastic!!! For 40$ you get a controller that has the feel of an original xbox controller and comes with 2 pad/ trigger buttons and trigger locks. Everything works great. I use it for pc, before this I've always used a standard xbox1 controller and because my bluetooth is awful ive always had to connect using a USB cord, which sucks because it was always coming unplugged mid game. I was concerned about this controller because it is also connected using a USB but they put in extra bulk and little locks to keep it from falling out of your controller!! The extra triggers work great, I notice alot of high end controller's extra triggers are more trigger shaped and these are just small buttons but they are very easy to use and I dont know if I'd want them any other way. The extra triggers essentially copy and button on your controller. Examples: I can make my extra trigger be the same as my a button. I have my right programmed to a and my left programmed to b. This gives me the ability to crouch slide and jump on apex without having to let go of the joysticks.

  I'm glad there were some great reviews on this item, I love it. It's comfortable and looks awesome. I just keep it on purple where it looks amazing next to my pc that is also black with purple LED's. It's more accurate than nearly any other controller I've ever used. There's something with the triggers and their sensitivity that makes them better than any other triggers. If I'm playing like GTA Online and I pull the trigger to press the gas pedal in a car just a tiny bit, it gives it just a tiny bit of gas. If I depress it all the way, it zooms off. Works perfectly with Windows 10 and Steam recognized it like an old friend. Feels really good in the hand too. I'm not a fan of the small tops of the thumbsticks, but I always use some KontrolFreeks thumbsticks anyway so they're perfect now. Direction pad is okay, seems like no one makes them like the old ones anymore, but we also barely use them like we used to: they're always for toggling weapons or commanding followers, not actually moving anything around, so it really doesn't matter. Buttons feel great, always responsive. If I ever get an Xbox One, I will buy one of these immediately. If this device is indicative of PowerA's other controllers, I will be buying others very soon.

",5.0,Negative459Top Contributor: Photography,"Reviewed in the United States April 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  Very pleased with this. After a few years of beatings my Power A Fusion Pro (The old version with the gold buttons and triggers) was finally starting to give out. I was going to get another but then I noticed this Spectra model had all the same features except the interchangeable analog sticks for half the price. In fact, it has 3 way selectable trigger locks, the lighting features, and a nicer (in my opinion) finish, which the Fusion doesn't. The analog pads on the Specta are the smaller concave ones, where as I had put the larger concaves on my fusion but that's not a deal breaker. I like that it has a locking micro USB cable so I can remove it for travel or storage, or attach a longer one if I ever need to. Super pleased with this purchase.

    Works pretty well. RGB a gimmick. Worth the price
  
",4.0,Robert P.,"Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  The construction is quite good.  It feels solid in your hand.  It's not feather light like the really cheap controllers.  The buttons are responsive, the thumb sticks are precise and smooth.  The D-pad works well and the vibration is strong and well defined.  The cable is MicroUSB and while it can be replaced with most standard cables, the cable it comes with is customized to snap in place and stay there firmly.  It is also plenty long, of good quality, and sleeved.  The mfg does have a support site where you can download updated firmware.  And there was a firmware update which I installed.  It also has a ""Calibration"" mode.  So, if it were not working properly you could re-calibrate and it might help.Here's the NOT SO GOOD:  The RGB is essentially pointless but if you're into that kind of thing so be it.  The button mapping onto the ""paddle"" buttons works the same as other controllers but I wish they had added the ability to map select and start as well. It would have been nice if they'd added a turbo or macro function which would have made it a lot more useful (they did not).  Also, they are a little bit awkward to press sometimes, but maybe that's just me.Compared to Microsoft XBOX ONE Bluetooth controller (Model 1708).  The 1708 controller is basic, it is lacking the paddle buttons and any kind of trigger locks.  The Analog sticks feel identical.  I can't tell a difference except that the Microsoft controller thumbstick caps are rubber and they are hard plastic on this one.  That's always the first thing that wears out on Microsoft controllers (in my experience) so that may be a good thing.  I never felt these were uncomfortable to use or anything.  The Trigger buttons on the 1708 feel better than these.  These aren't bad, just not quite as ""premium"" feeling.  However, the ABXY buttons on this controller are better.  After using this one for a week the ones on the 1708 feel cheap by comparison.  This controller is covered with a rubberized texture which feels much nicer than the hard plastic on the 1708.  However, it also shows the oils from your fingers quite well (mostly on the select and start buttons because they are smaller) and I find myself cleaning it often.  Also, these kinds of rubberized coatings usually degrade over time into a sticky mess but to be fair I don't know if that's going to happen here.  Finally the vibration on this controller is noticeably stronger than the 1708, probably because it's a wired controller.Overall, it's a good, solid controller with a couple extra features you may or may not care about.  For the money it's VERY worth it and you could do much much worse.  I would buy it again.

    Right Trigger Doesn't Work Well
  
",2.0,Johnny E,"Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  Was playing a racing game and the accelerator is the right finger trigger.  I felt like the car was not going as fast as it was supposed to go, so I switched to my cordless, original Xbox, controller and the car immediately gained speed.  I don't believe this controller's trigger is constructed correctly for the kind of sensitivity required for car racing games.  This is my only criticism of the controller.

  bought this because I have arthritis and trying to manuever my character in Ark Survival Evolved was hell using a keyboard and track pad. I cant use a mouse as that hurts the fingers horribly. this makes game playing a little easier.I find the controller to be a bit awkward. the D pad is just a smidge to far to the center. Consequently if I try to click the right button it often results in the top being clicked instead.I find the L2 and R2 triggers are not long enough. super short and feels like i have to reach finger up instead of just easily pressing either one.It feels very well made.Im not a fan of the two extra buttons underneath. To easy to accidentally hit them. SO I likely will not program them for anything.No instruction in the box. but literally plug and play. Worked great!I would have preferred a wireless controller. However, with my laptop it seems wired works best. And the cord is very nicely done. longer than I need it to be. However if I had an xbox the extra length would be a blessing as I keep my consoles across the room under the tele.Id give it six stars if it werent for the Dpad and the short R2/L2

  One star is pretty harsh, I know. And I'm sure not everyone will have a 1 star experience. But heres what I think:THE GOOD:-haha pretty colors go brrrr-joysticks felt SUPER snappy and responsive the entire time I used it- buttons arent mushy like on some controllers, you can tell they're spring loaded like a mechanical keyboard- great grip. Not too fat like some xbox controllers I've had.- advanced buttons are in a fine spot. Feels awkward at first but you get used to it.THE BAD- slides to lock the triggers are super easy to accidentally hit- even easier to accidentally switch off your favorite color- last but not least, the damn thing broke after a couple weeks.Yeah. I'm a rocket league player and put boost on right bumper. That bumper started to seem like it didnt want to stay pressed after a mere 3(?!?!) Play sessions of approx. an hour each. I could feel the plunger for the button stop depressing altogether after about 5 more sessions (that's being generous), to the point where the game more often than not thought I wasnt using it. Yes, I could simply remind the button or program the advanced buttons to be the bumper, but a controller's button shouldnt stop pressing after 2 weeks. Period. That's why I gave 1 star.Only bright side is it broke fast enough for me to still return it :)

It's a very pale lavender as opposed to the dark purple in the photos. But it still gets 5 stars as the functionality and build quality are great.

  I purchased this controller in August 2020 and it is now December 2020, the controller's Right Trigger has stopped working properly and the Sticks drift while aiming/moving in FPS games. This has become a favorite controller of mine but now that it has stopped responding it has become such a pain to play with and I've had to go back to a regular remote. PowerA has been contacted but no response from them, so hopefully, they will see this and provide a solution.I Will update soon.

  This is one of the greatest controllers I've ever used for XBOX. I think this is a better controller than the ones XBOX makes. It's a bit smaller, the buttons feel smoother to press, the triggers and bumpers are sized perfectly and are located just right. The back buttons are game changers. I didn't think I would use them but what a difference they make in multiplayer or single player gaming. Overall I'm hooked! This is the only controller I will use on my XBOX 1 X. Also, it's a great looking controller; PowerA knocked it out of the park with this one.

  The controller is cool and all but if you‚Äôre someone who likes to be in game/party chat a lot don‚Äôt buy this controller. I had the mic placed where I normally do and my friend said it sounded like I was whispering, so I had to have it pushed literally up to my lips for him to hear me. Asked him to rate 1-10 the loudness of my voice. Where I normally have the mic he said I was at about a 4 and with it basically in my mouth it only went up to a 6. Most of the time when it‚Äôs where I normally have it placed the mic isn‚Äôt even registering that I‚Äôm talking. I was wondering maybe it was just my mic, so I switched to another controller and he said my voice went to a crystal clear 10 and I had it away from my mouth.

    Doesn't work well with headset and stops working after 3 months of use
  
",1.0,twone,"Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  This controller sucks with headsets. At first I would have given this 5 stars. The controller feels and looks great.  I purchased another different controller a few weeks back from the company and was pleased with it so I figured this one would be just as satisfying with the 3 trigger lock option but I was WRONG. I tried the 3 trigger locks and they didn't work as good as expected so that gave it 4 stars. when I used my headset and to my unpleasant suprise. My headset picks up everything around. I hear myself echoing and my kid in the next room through the headset.  I thought it was the headset but once I got a new pair, different model I got  same results. Echoing  and no noise cancellation. This doesn't happen when I use my wireless controller.  I don't know what's wrong with this controller and why it does not work with my headsets but I will return it. So 2 stars it is.Update: still haven't heard anything back from the company but I wish I had just sent this back in hindsight because now the just completely stopped working. after 3 months. I bought this controller 2/8/2020 now its useless. This is the second controller I have purchased from the company (different and older model) That one still works. At first the controller would come on then turn off after about 20 minutes but note it doesn't come on at all. I thought it was the cable so I tried the cable from my other controller and NOTHING! I use this controller a lot lately since the work is on lockdown so it really sucks that it stopped working now. I did a review before regarding the mic issue when I use this controller during game chat. Haven't gotten a response from the company so be aware.  This controller starts off as a pretty good buy with the button layouts and reconfiguration of the buttons  and if you can get pass the nonexistent noise cancellation when using a headset but after a short period of time, it's useless all together. Purchase at your own risk but you've been warned.

  ¬†I will be doing a two-part review of this product. No, this is not a fake review. No, I did not receive this for free from Amazon Vine. Yes, I researched extensively and bought this myself.*For the Moms:This controller is great. The quality is good. It feels solid and weighty, the lights are bright, buttons are crisp, sticks are smooth. All good signs. You're getting what you pay for, and then some, because this is objectively better than stock XBOX controllers. Ever got something you wanted for Christmas, but it ended up being an inferior version of what you actually wanted, and you hated it but couldn't say anything without being rude? This is how your son will feel if you buy any other third party controller available nowadays. If you want to ensure nobody is suffering in silence, buy this. Besides, those lights are really cool.*For the Gamers:Alright, lets get down to business.Build Quality:XYAB feels the same as XBOX. LB RB and D-Pad has the same tactile feel as an Apple TV remote or any similar thin clicky remotes. USB cord and connection is solid. Once you plug it in, that sucker is NOT coming out. Holding firmly with both hands and twisting like trying to wring out a towel results in zero squeaking. I'm really trying to break this thing. It's not making any noise. LT and RT have a good resistance, not too little not too much.Lights:Very strong but diffused so it's easy on the eyes and doesn't have any ""strong"" spots. Swiveling the analog sticks around will reveal dim spots, but just barely.Rumble:Not much to say here. Similar to XBOX. A little less refined maybe, but that's a good thing because it makes it feel a bit more intense.Sensitivity and Deadzones, the Most Important Thing That Nobody Talks About:Let's face it, you buy controllers nowadays for games that require fine control. The ranges of motion on LT, RT, and the analog sticks are extremely important. I can't for the life of me find the proper term for what I'm about to describe, so I'll just be referring to them as ""Physical Range"", and ""Virtual Range"".Physical Range is the literal range of motion available to you on the input. On RT, unpressed is 0% and pressed all the way down is 100%. Virtual Range is what the software reads. The key to good controllers and the thing that plagues bad controllers is the relationship between the Virtual Ranges and the Physical Ranges on your inputs (more specifically, where the virtual range lies on the physical). On an XBOX controller, pushing the physical down to 5% will do nothing, the software still thinks you're at 0%. It is only when you get to around 6% physical input that the software will register 1% input. This is the ""dead-zone"". Also for XBOX, reaching about 95% physical input will result in 100% virtual input on the software, and pushing it any further will make no difference. This is the ""bottom-out"". What this means is from 0-5% and 95-100%, nothing is happening. It is only at 5-95% that you have any real influence on the inputs. XBOX is good, but 10% of the motion you paid 60 bucks for is not available to you, and that sucks.Herein lies the problem with third party controllers. Other than a really good controller I had 10 years ago (also by PowerA but now discontinued), all the physical vs. virtual ranges have been absolutely atrocious. Most controllers have ranges on 30-100% (huge dead-zone), or ranges on 0-70% (huge bottom-out). My latest purchase from RegeModual had its range on 0-40%. I couldn't believe it. I returned it and got this controller instead. Boy, was I surprised. The ranges are 0-100%, a perfect 1-to-1 ratio. Yeah, that's right, its better than XBOX. To my knowledge, NO other controllers are this good. Not even PowerA's 20 dollar controller on amazon (sorry PowerA). Everything else sucks. XBOX controllers suck. This is how it should be.If you care at all about really having a good controller, this is all that matters. Aiming properly in FPS, feathering your throttle in racing sims, edge-lord slow-walking in Dark Souls, all of this can only be done with good input ranges, and this is the gold standard. Forget the flashy lights, the build quality, the price, the ease-of-use, etc. The biggest indicator of quality is this, and for some reason, nobody talks about it. If you don't believe me, buy this and you'll realize how much better gaming feels.I've included a video of this. As you can see, the input ranges are matched up perfectly.Longevity:Just bought this and I've only logged a few hours on it. Right out of the box, it feels incredible. I would have easily paid double the price of an XBOX controller. However, only time will tell if this controller holds up. So far, I expect this controller to last at least 1000 hours of use before any significant signs of wear. It'll probably last much longer. Obviously, your mileage may vary, but as long as you don't throw this thing across the room every time you get headshotted, I fully expect this to stand the test of time.Take a look at how old my review is. If anything breaks or any inputs get wonky, I'll be adding an edit to my review to let you guys know. If there are no edits down below, it means it's still going strong.Seriously, just get this controller. I'm not receiving anything from the company or amazon to give it a favorable review, it's just that good. I'm doing this because I know the pain of dealing with crappy controllers, and I want to help people out. I hope this has been helpful. Have an awesome day. :)

  The controller is nice, but I received a defective one. It would randomly disconnect and become unresponsive. My only solution was to unplug it and plug it back in, and sometimes it would take several attempts. I decided to download a firmware update for the controller through the PowerA website, and when I tried to update it, the progress didn't reach 10% before I got an error message telling me to plug the controller back in. After this point, it was totally unresponsive, and my computer could only recognize it as a ""USB ISP"" device, rather than an Xbox peripheral device as it did before.I have since returned the controller and I've ordered another one. I will update this review once I have recieved the replacement. Defective items happen from time to time-- that's understandable. Perhaps I was just unlucky. When the controller actually was connected, it performed great! However, at this time I cannot rate it higher than 2/5.

  If you are looking for a great controller for your PC, then this one is perfect! Build quality is top notch.

By far the best 3rd party controller I've ever felt.Analog sticks are perfectly fine. Read other reviews about how they are not to standard. They are fine!The D-Pad is far better feeling than the original Xbox one controller.The X, Y, A, B buttons are muted and not clicky loud. Has that old-school feel like a proper console controller.Shoulder buttons LB and RB are smooth and not clicky.HTPC players will love the 10ft bradded cord.It also has a safety breakaway portion on the cord in case someone trips on it.RGB lights look nice.The PRICE!The Cons:The Trigger buttons are probably the only downside to this review. They feel hollow and not smooth in actuation compared to the Xbox one. Although it has a 3-level adjustment to your preference so it's not too bad.

  This controller was sold as new.  When it arrived, the box had a cut in it - ok, it could have been slit with a box knife, as long as the controller was ok.  I opened the box and the controller was in the box with the cords wrapped around it, not wrapped in plastic, no instructions, and there was hair stuck on the Velcro that goes around the cord!  AND....it was dirty.  I needed this for my son's birthday gift today and now he'll have to wait until I get a replacement.

    An amazing third party controller
  
",4.0,Kuro,"Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  If you're like me then you've always been hesitant to give third party controllers a fair shake. Companies like Mad Catz kind of gave third party controllers a bad wrap but this controller is an excellent substitute for a first party one.Pros:- Analog sticks. For me, this is the biggest reason I usually avoid third party controllers. They've typically been terrible feeling and unresponsive, not this controller though. The analog sticks feel great and are extremely responsive, I have no issues in first person shooters. In terms of feel, I'd say they're pretty akin to the 1st party Xbone controller. Looser than say, a Dualshock 4 and a 360 controller, but not too loose where it feels. Absolutely excellent job on the sticks.- Trigger stops. I've never had a controller with trigger stops before so this was a unique experience for me. I've grown to like this for certain games like shooters, but I typically keep them off.- 2 programmable buttons. I have to admit, I don't use these things much. I've only used them in FPS games where its awkward to jump and still aim. They do the job well and its a cool feature.- Buttons are all responsive and feel nice. The d-pad is a step above what you'd usually expect on an Xbox controller but its nothing to right home about, it feels responsive and does the job.- The controller looks and feels cool. I think the appearance of the controller is what draws a lot of people in and it definitely lives up to it in person. It looks absolutely amazing with the RGB lights on and the overall finish on the controller just looks clean and great.- It's wired. Some people may see this as a con, but for me its a pro. I mainly use my controller for PC gaming and so wireless doesn't really interest me. I don't want to deal with charging my battery or possible input lag, I just want a controller I can plug in and work. The cable itself is braided and high quality, and it comes with a Velcro strap for easy cable management.Neutral:- The connector is Micro USB. Normally this would be a huge con, heck a deal breaker for me. Micro USB is possibly the worst connector ever made, it wears out easily over time and becomes loose and disconnects often after awhile. People who have owned a Dualshock 4 or any device with it probably have experienced this. To have it on a purely wired controller, that does not work without the wire I might add, seemed like a huge misstep to me. However, PowerA in their infinite wisdom seem to have thought this through. The USB connector is snugly recessed into the controller and the cable itself has hooks on the side which keep the connector firmly in place. That means even if the physically connection does wear out through unplugging the controller, its not likely to affect much.This is all fine and dandy, and I'm glad they realized the connector was bad, but this brings about its own issues. The USB cable that came with the controller is not easily replaceable since it relies on the hooks on the connector to keep it in place. Two, since the USB connection on the controller is recessed in a small hole on the controller, you have to be really careful about which cable you buy for it. Basically, finding a replacement USB cable for this thing is going to be a nightmare. Their solution seems completely unnecessary when they could have just put a better connector instead of Micro USB to begin with.If you're buying this controller, I HIGHLY recommend never removing the USB cable from the controller once its in.Cons:- I praised the trigger stops earlier but they're not perfect. There are 3 settings, normal which is no stops, medium, and full stops. I don't know what the cause is, but the trigger stops on the highest setting just outright don't work for some games. Most games I've tried do work though, so this is kind of a baffling issue. I suspect it has to do with sensitivity and how much the trigger stop pushes physically on the button. However, this issue only exists on the highest setting of the trigger stops. The medium setting and normal setting don't have this issue.- The finish. The controller looks damn cool and the finish looks really nice, but you sacrifice a bit for those looks. The controller has a rubberized kind of texture on the face, and there's no getting around it, this finish is absolutely terrible for a controller. It's a fingerprint magnet of the highest degree and if your hands are even remotely sweaty, this controller won't be doing you any favors. On the bright side, the finish is easy to clean with a damp paper towel and a microfiber cloth. I've been able to get it back to good as new fairly easily, but boy, this thing looks ugly even after one gaming session.Overall, I gave this a 4/5. I would like to see a revision of this controller with a more robust connector and a different finish on it, but even so I've had a great experience with this thing. Would recommend.

    The Bottom Buttons Alone are Worth the Money
  
",5.0,Michael M.,"Reviewed in the United States April 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have used PowerA controllers previously; the cheaper Enhanced controllers. One of them has been my main controller for almost two years before one of the sticks started squeaking a bit. It still works fine, but the squeaking drives me insane so I opted to try the Spectra as it sounded a little more high quality.The other Enhanced controller had audio issues so I contacted PowerA support and they quickly resolved it by sending me a brand new replacement. I cannot say enough about awesome their support was; A+So far with the Spectra, I love this thing. All of the buttons feel nicer than the Enhanced controller. The shoulder buttons stand out to me as feeling even better than the Microsoft stock controller. I am very impressed.The controller feels nice in hand, but I do wish the same soft finish on the top was on the bottom too instead of slick plastic. It's very heavy, in fact, too much for just components inside to be that heavy. I suspect it has weights like I saw the Fusion Pro has on a YouTube review. That is kind of cheesy, but at the same time it does make it seem easier to hold onto than the lighter Enhanced controller so maybe it's a good thing.The back buttons are in the perfect places for easy access but not be in the way. They are easy to program even during games. Those buttons are the sole reason I bought a PowerA to begin with and I am glad a company like PowerA is giving us those options at a very nice price.The sticks and d-pad both feel great too. PowerA sticks seem to have a little more resistance than the stock Xbox controller and I like that.The cord is braided, very long, and seems very high quality. The little release things on the side where it connects to the controller are hard to push and thus it's hard to disconnect it from the controller. But that isn't really an issue as there is no need to disconnect it.I've heard of people having audio problems on Xbox Live with this controller but I updated the firmware (with the download from PowerA's website) as soon as I opened the box and have had zero audio issues chatting with buddies on Xbox Live.Although I didn't care about the lights when deciding to buy it, they are kind of cool I have to say. They are soft, not too bright and easy to change.Overall I love this controller. I have heard a lot of people complain about bad luck with PowerA controllers. But I have had nothing but good experience with them and the one time I did have a problem they fixed it fast. This controller seems awesome and with the customer service I experienced plus with it having a two-year warranty, I see no reason to not think this was a great purchase.

  Okay so I needed a replacement controller for my PC. I wanted to find something that didn't have the micro usb breakage issues that normal msoft controller are known for.  I prefer wired over wireless as I have had several great moments in gaming that have been completed destroyed by conductivity issues.So out of the box this thing look absolutely amazing. It has a stunning mat black finish and RGB lighting accents around the control buttons and sticks. As well as a very cool thin line that goes around the entire body where the seam is. It is very pretty!The cord is what this thing was all about for me and it did not disappoint.  It uses thick gauge wire similar to the $10 phone charging cables you can find a petrol stations. They used a clamping design that prevents accidental disconnections and its incredibly rugged. Gives off the impression that it will have no issues surviving a knock to the ground.  I haven't tried that but it's good to know that there is a better chance of it surviving a fall then a normal micro usb connected one.The RGB lighting is self contained and can be very easily adjusted on the fly by pressing the button on the back of the controller. Speaking of the back of the controller, it has trigger stays that can be adjusted with a switch making it again very easy for on the fly changes.  There are also 2 programmable buttons that are very comfortable to use. They are assigned by pressing and holding down the button above the RGB one until the power led light on the front starts to flash. Then all you need to do is push whatever you want to assign to it and your done. Again all adjustment are so simple that it can be changed in a matter of seconds during a session and you don't need any software to get it done.I have over 50 hours with it and have expedience no performance issues at all. This is a very solid build device.Now for why its 4 stars.That beautiful mat black finish. Well you really need to take a few selfies with it. Maybe introduce it to your parents and possibly a nice dinner. Because after about your 10th hour in it's going to turn into a pumpkin.  There will be wear marks all over the place. To the point that it's rather ugly and very old looking.  Seriously I don't know what they were thinking. My friends were over the day I took it out of the box. They were interested in it until they watched it go from a shelve queen to a dumpster fire almost over night. This is completely avoidable and I'm rather confused as to why it was green lit.The only other complaint I have with it is with the trigger stays. They can be so easily adjusted on the fly that accidental movement is a thing and if your not aware confusion will be a foot. I have lost races and a few gun battles because of this. It's not a deal breaker now, whenever it happens I just flick it back into position.  But the first couple of times it's going to frustrate you.Over all if your looking for a wired controller and don't mind the wear issues with the finish. You really can't go wrong with it. This is by far the best controller I have played within this price point.

  Three month update:After regular usage, I have to reduce my rating from 5 stars to 1, as it has become unusable. Both triggers started sticking today, and no longer function regardless of the position of the length of pull adjuster.Great feeling controller! The buttons and thumbs sticks are crisp, and reactive. The trigger pull positions work well, except in games where depth of press directly translates to amount of throttle. By shortening the trigger press, aiming down sights or firing becomes marginally faster. One time only, I pressed the right trigger hard, and it got stuck down. In order to release it, I had to slide the trigger adjuster. Only happened once in months of regular use, so I‚Äôm not going to use that to reduce the controller‚Äôs rating. If you are someone who slams on the triggers, you‚Äôll just have to forego the adjuster function. The mappable buttons on the underside of the controller as super useful! They are positioned right where my middle fingers naturally fall. I mapped the R2 and L2 bumper buttons to them, and it speeds up things such as throwing grenades in COD and using secondary spells or skills in RPGs.The only drawback, which is not an issue for me, is that there is no battery, so it must remain plugged in to use. The cord is long enough for sitting any reasonable distance from the xbox though. Also, it uses a 3.5mm jack instead of the proprietary xbox headset connection100% would buy again.

  Worked really well up until today, about 3 months after purchase. Now my right trigger activates the left thumbstick as if I‚Äôm holding the stick forward whenever I squeeze the trigger. I‚Äôm not finding an option here to replace the controller or contact the seller, so... hi, I would love it if it was replaced, please..Edit: getting sent a new one, will updateEdit 2: 5 Star, good controller, better value than normal Xbox controllers, assuming this next one continues working.

  1-7-21 i return controller and got a new one and have had no isses. Controller works great no drift or anything. Changing to 5 starsI bought this for my pc. its a nice controller but there are issues.1. was a pain in the a to get it to work on my pc. showed as a broken registry. had to unplug and restart multiple times for it to install and work2. buttons don't always respond . i hit buttons during game play wont register until I hit the button twice or three times.3.Right trigger is Messed up. Screws up a lot of games because it randomly does what it wants. i hit the button once and wont stop fireing i hit it again and it stops for a millisecond and continues firing. when i get it to stop. i hit it again and only fires once. then again fires three times. and again and doesn't respond. then when i hit another button right trigger will fire. fps gamers beware .

",2.0,Riley,"Reviewed in the United States May 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this controller for my boyfriend because he wanted a wired controller with extra buttons so he could customize his settings. After 6 months of playing the left stick has started to drag causing his character to walk in game when it should be standing still. As a gamer myself this is frustrating especially when your peaking over a ramp and you walked off because your controller has a drag. Like I said it was nice for about 6 months until this started to happen. Maybe I should of spent the extra money and got him an elite controller.

    Great Controller! Good substitute for Elite Controller
  
",5.0,zelphus molino,"Reviewed in the United States March 10, 2021","









  
  
    
  For a few more buttons & MAYBE better gameplay, the Xbox elite controller is very expensive. This controller comes with two programmable buttons on the back of the controller that makes this controller not only a colorful one but a game-enhancing one. The model of the controller is slightly different from the factory issue controller, but either way, the matte black finish is amazing, RGB lights are a nice touch, & the programmable buttons are major clutch.

    Receieved on May 1st, broke on June 8th
  
",3.0,Delbert Swartzentruber,"Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  It's a decent controller. The feel is good. The buttons underneath just take the place of two existing buttons and don't act as buttons themselves from what I could find. Meaning you could map one to the X key, and then you have two X buttons.More importantly, after a month of play the Right Bumper button broke. My return date was NLT on the 1st of June. Here it is, on the 8th of June so I can't return it. I popped the back off to see what the problem was and there was no noticeable problem. The key that the Right Bumper actually engages still works fine, but when you push in the bumper it doesn't activate the key.Can't even map the broken key to one of the buttons underneath. If it wasn't for that it would be a great controller.

  Controlls feel great. Good solid click from sticks. Just keep in mind that all games don't have pressure sensitivity for shooters ... That being said if your using as a pc controller us full trigger setup. Overall great buy. I would recommend it. In case you're worrying about the durability is not made with cheap plastic at least it doesn't feel like that. And it has some weight to it. p.s. it can survive call of duty rage quits lol
