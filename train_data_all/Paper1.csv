    Noticably better quality
  
",5.0,AnnieInAcworth,"Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2018","









  
  
    
  A lot of people use copier paper in their ink jet printer and then wonder why their printer jams and breaks down early. I have learned the hard way that to get grief-free, long-life from my ink-jet printers, it is best to use ink-jet paper. The higher quality results are noticable, there is less dust given off that collects in the mechanism of the printer, and the printer lasts longer.But more importantly, when I hand someone a document that I printed on this paper, it is not unusual to hear ""Oh, you use good paper."" That makes me feel good.

  This is a very reasonably priced general-purpose white printer paper.  It is 'ultra white,"" and the paper works extremely well with especially HP printers, but probably any printers in terms of clean and accurate feeds and precision results.  Print quality is very crisp and clean; even photographs reproduce well on this paper.  The price is excellent for this level of quality, and a paper of this type should always be used with better inkjet or laser printers made by HP and other manufacturers.

  This is a great product. Bright white, nice weight.  My suggestion:  do not order it with other items.  When I did do so (twice), the shipping box was not sufficiently packaged to prevent damage from the heavy ream of paper to other items in the box, nor to itself, as it apparently flew around the inside of the shipping box during the shipping process.  If you want the product, and hope for a positive outcome, my suggestion: order it solo.  I won't order it from Amazon with other items again.  As an aside, Amazon was great with providing me a refund.

    PAPER QUALITY ON THE DECLINE
  
",2.0,ParisRoseLady,"Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  I thought this paper would be at least servicable judged on reviews, however it is very thin and lackluster.  I am a real estate broker and need to print reports for my customers and this paper produces reports that are poor quality, with ink bleeding through to the back and edges that curl up.  It's just plain flimsy.  It's actually the worst paper I have ever worked with, and I certainly expected better from the HP brand!  I'm assuming this paper was made decently in the past, however what they are now delivering must have suffered a severe drop in quality.

    Will NOT print without jamming - worst paper ever
  
",1.0,D. J. Merhalski,"Reviewed in the United States October 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  This is by far the worst printer paper I've ever used. It absolutely will not print in my Epson NX420 without jamming. I'm throwing away the ream of paper rather than risk breaking my printer with paper jam after paper jam. When I try printing with a sheet from another brand, I have no problem at all. As soon as I try using this again, I'm back to constant jamming. This was a lesson learned the hard way.

    Consistent steady supply
  
",5.0,Dennis Hamilton,"Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have found that this paper is the most consistent for every-day inkjet printer usage on the two HP ENVY Photo units in the household.  It is used mostly for black-and-white and pages such as emails and with highlight colors like the grocery shopping list from the grocery web site.  It works well with images from screen captures and on-line sites, even white on saturated black backgrounds when I can't avoid them.  I rarely need to switch to photo quality paper and high-quality print settings.Although HP provides on-line ordering, I have found order-management and fulfillment by Amazon Prime to be easier and also a cost-benefit, along with elimination of inessential travel.  This July 20, 2020 order was a re-order of a 2018-11-23 order of the same product.  There is no problem keeping a supply for such an extended time, consuming on ream at a time.

    Solid Results from My New Laser Jet Printer
  
",5.0,Maryland Techy,"Reviewed in the United States October 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've gone through a ton of printers.  It seems right when their factory ink runs out, they start having issues.  So I got tired of the BS and took the plunge and got an HP Laser Jet Pro printer.  Of course, with crappy paper, the colors would be dull, the feel of the paper is sketchy, getting it to feed properly without jamming (especially in the heat of a laser printer) is all basically a flip of the coin.  ""Here's hoping it feeds...and feeds straight...and holds the ink...and doesn't smear.So I got some HP paper figuring HP paper, HP printer, match made in heaven and I can finally stop feeling a twinge of anxiety as to if sending something to print will be the beginning of a battle with the printer, the ink, and the paper.GOOD NEWS, this paper feels great, it feeds perfectly (just the right thickness of paper) and holds the ink perfectly!  Its not the least expensive paper you could buy on Amazon...but hey, you get what you pay for.  And to have prints you can rely on...this is your best bet!

  I thought I was getting good paper with all the 5 star reviews here. But when I looked at a sheet, something seemed off about it.At my office, we use Staples brand 20 lb 92 brightness paper, the same specs as this HP paper.  I went to my office and brought one sheet of the Staples paper home so I could compare it with the HP paper.I could definitely see a difference holding up the sheets against a light. The HP paper looked more ""spotty"" than the Staples paper.  Just hold up a sheet against a light and you'll see what I mean.  The Staples paper is less spotty.  Also, the Staples paper is more white, and the HP paper looks a bit purplish against a light.Also, I bought 3 of these reams, and like several other reviewers mentioned, 2 of the reams had the packaging ripped open in the box.

  I can't fault the product.  It is fine.  Unfortunately, don't try to buy only one.  The product was shipped in one of those flimsy plastic mail envelopes.  I doubt it even got outside of the gates before the paper wrapping around the ream split open.  Let's face it, everything get jostled around during shipping, so expecting something to not get tossed is not realistic.  In the end, I had a package full of bent, dinged, ripped and unacceptable paper.  I was able to salvage a surprisingly large amount, but 1/4 to 1/3 was still just not usable.

  I ordered this product because it had good reviews. These cartridges are extremely difficult to insert.  They are packaged oddly and have no instructions inasmuch as they don't look like the regular Brothers cartridges.  At first the printing was okay.  Then the black would not show up.  I supposed that was the reason there are a few more black cartridges than any other colors.  When I tried to eject the black cartridge it wouldn't budge.  I had to eject the color beside it in order to get it out with difficulty. It was also odd that my computer did not warn me that my  printer was low on ink.  Anyway, even after changing cartridges, the black printing never showed  up or came in very light.  I have finally found and ordered Brothers cartridges, due to come in tomorrow. I only hope my printer isn't ruined.  They warn you never to use any cartridges but Brothers cartridges.  I wish I had stuck to that.

Otherwise, the brightness was just fine, I am tossed up about value for money rating but it was a good price, just by the time it arrived to me the value was seriously depreciated. So, oh well!!!

Worse yet, sometimes the pages  that were supposed to print are not centered properly on the pages, and text gets cut off. My printer works perfectly with the more costly paper. With this paper, I have frequent frustration, waste and wasted extra time. This might work for your machine, but for me, I will pay extra for the paper that works.

I bought a new printer last year, and I didn‚Äôt use it that frequently.My business started growing this year, so I found that I had to rely on my HP printer a lot more now. When my paper ran out, I checked on Amazon to see what the options were.Usually Amazon Basics is the cheapest option, so I was surprised to see that HP had a better deal.The print quality on this paper is great, and I haven‚Äôt had any issues with it.

  When it arrives, the package broke and some of the paper got damaged a little bit. The paper inside is kind of as expected, but I think I should have used another brand or type of paper.About this paper: Thin, somehow transparent, white but not with too much brightness. It has everything that the paper needs to be, but just doesn't make me too happy after I printed things out by my Epson Ecotank ET series printer.I would just use it to print things that doesn't need to last long since I don't feel like to have these paper stapled together and use them forever. That is to say, if you would like to print out random things or temporary things, you could go for this paper.

    Paper in top ream damaged
  
",2.0,Christopher Johnson,"Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  I would like to verify others' complaints about this paper. It's a stack of three reams in a cardboard box.  The base of the box houses two reams completely, but the top ream extends out of the top of the box. The lid covers the rest. The part of the ream that sticks out of the bottom box slides around during shipping making the paper warp and crinkle. Even if you decided to use the crinkled paper, it gets jammed in the printer. One would think that in 2020, they would have such a simple and obvious problem figured out. My guess is that this paper isn't made or processed by anyone that is actually an HP employee; it probably gets farmed out to a contractor. It's amazing to me that HP either doesn't realize or doesn't care that when they put their brand name on something, they're the ones taking the hit for shoddy quality. Dumb. SMH.

  This paper is a little thinner and ""toothier"" than the heavier, smoother 24-pound Xerox paper I usually buy, which could explain why it jammed in my laser printer. It was a real bear getting it unwrapped from around the paper rollers and free up the printer so I could finish printing! :\ However, it is a nice bright white color and the laser printer toner-ink seems to adhere to its surface just fine. I would prefer a smoother surface, though.later (2019) edit:This paper has jammed again in my HP laser printer. Am knocking a star off my rating. They need to figure out how to make this paper heftier and smoother so it stops jamming up the printer.

  Can't knock any points off this paper, it is great.But I will say, for those (like me) that don't really print much and don't know anything about paper weighting, you'll probably want to get some thicker paper if you're printing standalone sheets.If you're printing a lot of pages for a binder or something, this paper is ideal.

  I have nothing bad to say about the paper.  HP paper is an excellent paper for general printing and copying using an ink jet printer.  The issue we had was with the delivery.  Not sure who did the handling but by the time the box arrived it was ""bent"" and several of the paper reams were torn open.  Fortunately the paper itself was not damaged (surprised by that).  I think the damage was due to the HP box being bound in a plastic strip that was used to carry the box from place to place.  Absolutely no ""care"" was taken to handle the package.

  This is a great value. The paper is thin, like a general use printer paper. The edge can be sharp so be careful. It does have a nice smooth finish, unlike most general use copy paper. This smooth finish may be problematic if you have not cleaned your printer's rollers in a long time because smoother paper is not so easy to grab. I enjoy the finish, so for me it is a plus.

I should write a review!""This is plain old paper- nothing fancy or sleek- but it is all you need in this day and age.  If you want high quality paper, it is usually to take a resume to an interview or job fair or because you have a sales proposal or something else to provide a customer.  The rest of what we print is usually just for editing ""off screen"" before we submit something electronically. For this type of printing the paper (and the VALUE) cannot be beat.In the past year and a half, this box of paper has helped my family as follows:-I was able to edit my doctoral dissertation.  Though each chapter was submitted online, I had to edit them before submitting and I felt compelled to read my professor's comments (also provided online) on a printed document. The same goes with what I submitted to my dissertation committee.  When the final submission was provided, I had to do a complete review before I submitted it. Lordy, I did a lot of printing!-My son was able to edit his college application essays (so he could edit them before submitting them online).  So far, he has one college acceptance letter and is awaiting word from four more universities!-Our three kids printed all their class assignments (all in high school last year, my step-daughter now attending community college).- And more, I am sure!Again, given that most of us still need to read a hard copy document to edit, this paper is great!Oh- I've read that a lot of folks with the lower ratings received their box in bad shape, so their problem was with the packaging.  My box arrived in great condition and even if it hadn't, I have other boxes and bins I could have stored this paper in.  That's why I was willing to take the chance and order it.One and a half years later- I am still glad I did!

  We always see ""Use xyz brand supplies in your xyz printer for best results"" but how often can you get xyz brand at half off with free shipping?With amazon delivering it to me I am able to keep tray 2 in all my printers loaded with 11x17 paper for tabloid jobs.  This works equally well in my BIJ 2600 and CLP 5550 printers.  Standardizing on tray 2 as 11x17 and tray 1 as 8.5x11 helps with the new (7-2010) win7 printer driver.Everyone seems happy when the printers have both sizes (legal has fallen out of favor due to filing difficulties of those extra 3 inches - folding an 11x17 down the middle allows it to be filed and bound along with 8.5x11, just as a fold out).  On the rare occasions we print on legal it is cut to size by the designjet cutter from roll paper stock, of course law offices would prefer the legal size but design firms seem to prefer tabloid sheets.  For those professions I believe HP makes a legal size as well.This is a no-jam, excellent ink, semi large format paper without having to go to roll feed.  The in between size (13x19) is seldom used due to high costs and lack of filing systems for retention.My personal favorite use is printing complex websites that overlap onto 2 pages from my display on 11x17 pages landscape - it looks on the paper 1:1 with my display.

  The paper is good... but two of them came in a large box and somehow one corner of the box was smashed, and the corners of one of the two got damaged too. Those papers are now not great for my copier as it will get jammed. But if delivered properly, this is a great product. My other one is fine and I am happy with the quality of the paper and the price.

  I order this paper on Saturday, July 2, 2011 and it arrived early a.m. Thursday, July 7, 2011 with standard shipping which ran a little more than $9.00, which is still very inexpensive considering the amount of paper received.  The box arrived in a sturdy Official HP Box.  While the box was a bit worn upon arrival, the paper arrived in great usable shape.The first few top sheets were a little bent on one corner, but not badly and it really looks like they'll be okay once run through the printer (still have some old paper I'm using up, so will post my printing experiences with it later).The paper is what I expected and is the same as what you would get in any store that sell's HP Paper of this thickness and brightness.  I use this thickness of paper heavily and for just about everything except resumes.I've bought paper of this thickness and brightness before for drafts of artwork.  Business letter's are fine with this too unless you are planning to use some kind of stamp embossing.I'm very happy with this purchase and will purchase it again if it's still available after our family uses up the 2,500 sheets.  Thanks for a great product at a great price.  Of course I would have been really thrilled if I could have gotten this with free shipping.

  For times when you need a hard copy for your own use and it's not going to be ""archival"" this is a great choice.  Print quality is clear for text.  We use this with an inexpensive inkjet printer and it's perfectly adequate.  It's cheap enough so you can let kids use it to draw on or use it for scratch paper too.

  Paper is like super thin, I would print things and just the ink alone would print over to the back and often tear the paper upon instant contact. Even after putting it in a folder or binder the corners would be bent or completely ripped which I honestly don't even know how that could happen. I may give them another chance, let's see how the remainder of the batch goes.

  This is perfectly acceptable paper for normal day-to-day printing jobs.  The paper weight is heavy enough that it doesn't tear not show print through the other side.  I use it on my inkjet printer.  For high quality printing, however, you'd want something better but that fact doesn't detract from the conclusion that is is perfectly fine for day to day use.

  I remember working at a computer lab and having to rip apart the packaging for the reams of paper. So annoying, because the printers would churn through a ream in about two hours or so. This is so much easier, because the paper is all in the box, and you just reach in and grab a bunch. It's even better, because I now work in an office, where our printer doesn't take a ream of paper at a time, so having no divided up reams is even more valuable for me. Shipping was fine. It got here on time.The paper itself is fine too. I'm not printing anything in there that needs to be archived for the centuries, so I couldn't care less if the paper were thin. But it's not thin paper. It's plenty thick enough for my needs. It's also bright white, and I didn't notice any blemishes or issues with my laser printer at home or in the laser printer at the office.

I have ordered this box a number of times, and sometimes the delivery service has been less than kind to the box.  Admittedly, it is a heavy item.  But that doesn't mean they can toss the box around.My advice -- When the box arrives, give it a quick visual inspection.  Particularly for dents and cuts in the box.  Make sure they don't damage the paper inside.Usually everything is fine.  That's a small bit of caution.  You'll probably not have any trouble.  The product itself is great.

  This review may be a bit miss-leading because the paper is not the problem, the packaging is. This ream of paper arrived with the plastic wrapper split and a lot of the paper was loose.in the box. Some of it is useable but some is not because of jamming possibilities. Its not cost effective to return it and not economical because only some can be used. This is the second time this happened, the first was with a ream of 8 1/2 X 14"". I won't be ordering it again.

  The paper itself is soft, which is a good thing. The down side is that the paper really is thin and really thin paper make it for your printer getting jammed. The printer kept on occasion taking 2 pages and it would get jammed.

  This paper sizing is as advertised. The sheets are 8.5x11 inches and they work nicely in my printer. The brightness is as promised, though some sheets look to me like a 92-93 brightness in the daylight, but that is fine. In the dark these sheets of paper are not bright at all, but I still like them. They are a good value.

  It appears that Amazon has resolved the problem of some companies shipping this product without placing it in a separate container (as reported in some earlier reviews). The ""Quickpack"" box is an advertised feature of this product. Any company that sells and ships it should be aware of this fact and pack it inside of a separate cardboard shipping box. That said, this is an average quality paper with a premium shipping cost. I only recommend this product for those who prefer the pull down side panel feature of the box itself.

  You can never have too much printer paper. You buy a pack of 500 sheets like this and you say, ""Now I'm set. I'm never running out of paper again."" That's exactly what the printer paper wants you think. If that's what you're thinking, they have you right where they want you. Because it won't be tomorrow, or the next day, or maybe even the next month, but just when you need to print something most... out of paper. And in a place like KC that WalletHub ranks as one of the top regions to start a business, that's a story I hear from my constituents over and over again. ""Business is booming,"" they say, ""But we keep running out of printer paper."" And I tell them, don't just buy one of these, buy two.

  The box really took a beating during shipping.  The paper is shipped in the original box that the paper comes in.  Some of the paper on top was crunched up because of damage to the top of the box.  Also, about 2/3 of the way down the box it looks as if the paper did not get put in the box properly at the factory and was not stacked neatly and was therefore folded and crunched up.I'm not sure I would buy this again.  Also, this is not reams of paper but just a box of 2500 loose paper.

  This paper is so thin that it doesn't feed through my printers one at a time. Two or three sheets slip through together causing pages to print half on one sheet, some on another, etc.  I decided to use the paper to write on but, only a pen works on this stuff. Pencils barely make a mark on it. I had to use a 6B pencil to get readable writing. Sure wish I hadn't bought so much!

  The easy to open box without internal wrappers seems like a great idea except Amazon ships the box without an outer-box, so the box that you are stuck with is covered in grime and dirt when it arrives.  If Amazon would ship the box within another box to protect it from damage and dirt, this product would be a great idea.  Now I am stuck with a 2500 sheet box of paper that is dented, torn, dusty, and partially covered in an unknown sticky black residue.

    Disappointing paper from HP
  
",2.0,Dr Dave,"Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2017","









  
  
    
  This is a somewhat disappointing paper from HP. When you open the box, you will notice first that the color is really not a good paper color and also that the color is not uniform, nor is the tone even across the face of the paper, which gives the appearance of a subtle blotchiness. There is a hint of grey in in the color, which makes it look a bit like newsprint. It's a real misnomer to call this ""Ulta white""--""kinda greyish"" is more accurate.The second thing you will notice is that the paper is thin; now, this is 20lb paper, not 24, but it looks and feels thin.Lastly, this paper suffers from significant bleedthrough, which means that you cannot use it for double sided printing or copying.I will use the three reams, since it would be a shame to return the paper and possibly waste it, but I won't order more, as one should print double sided whenever possible to save paper.

  The paper works fine with my HP inkjet printer.What I like is how the paper is set in this box. There are no individual reams. This saves time cutting and opening reams of paper. I wasn't certain if I initially would like this idea but it works well.I keep the paper within the carton. The carton opens (as shown) for easy access.
