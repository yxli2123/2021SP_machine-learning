  I thought these cards were a great value for the price, BUT there was multiple sets of duplicates and there was about 5 cards of the same card. I gave 3 stars for the amount of cards I received and the price. Luckily my child is 5 and doesn’t really care about the quality of cards but the quantity.

",5.0,Dan C.,"Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2021","









  
  
    
  I had a great experience with both packs I bought (two different sellers, January 2021).Reading some of these reviews, I can safely say that it's all in WHO you buy from. One seller had no energy cards, minimal duplicates, included rares, and even threw in a few bonus cards. The other seller had minimal energy cards and NO DUPLCIATES. I would definitely consider buying from both of them again. You need to go in and really shop for which seller you get this from - go for the five star reviewed!This proved to be a good gamble for the money I invested, and really helped fill in some gaps in my personal collection. This would make a great gift as well to someone just starting out and looking for an affordable way to begin.

  I bought these cards for my grandsons birthday. The package contained only 21 cards (out of 50) that were not duplicates. There were as many as 4-6 identical cards of each that were duplicates!

Would have been awesome to get a bunch of Pokémon. Other reviews said they received 25 cards of two different Pokémon...We would have gladly taken the 25 of a single type of Pokémon to give out. Can’t do much with seven Pokémon for about 20 kiddos.And we can’t return them.

  I'm just getting back into Pokemon TCG collecting since I lost my entire collection back in 2002. I purchased this as a way to start building a base, while this product was on it's way to me, I had purchased some cards from the local Walmart. By the time the cards got to my house, I was excited, waiting to see what kind of random goodies it came with, and it is truly an assorted lot. I only received about 5 cards I did not already get from the packs at Walmart, everything else were basic cards from the current set, all commons and a few uncommons, no reverse holos and no rares or greater.Personally, will not buy again, there are far better uses of the price.

  My son loves pokemon, I have purchased 2 packs from here. I also sent my mom the link and she ordered a pack. All 3 were great. The packs separately did not have a ton of duplicates HOWEVER putting all 3 together almost every card had between 1 and 4 duplicates. So from our experience, the packs are all pretty much the same. They also didn't come with any good or ""rare"" cards. I would not suggest buying more than 1 pack from here, I won't be buying any more.

  I wasn’t expecting a holographic charizard or anything, and I expected a few duplicates but having 5-6 cards each of 3 Pokémon is a bit much. But the silver lining is that all the cards were Pokémon, no energy or trainer cards. I’m sure my 5 year old will still love them, maybe his friends have cards and will trade him some of their duplicates, but I probably wouldn’t buy this again.

  Absolutely no complaints from me. Especially since I went out and priced individual packs at a store (5/pack!!). I got these for my daughter who turns 10 this weekend. Her card collection is very limited, so I figured this would be a great way to boost it. There was 1 quadruplicate, 3 triplicates, and 7 duplicates. And I could have produced that buy buying packs at the store and spending a whole lot more. There was only 1 trainer, and yes, most of them were basic. But like I said, her collection is very limited anyway. I ended up with 57 cards total. So, all in all, I'm pleased. And I know she'll love it when she opens them up this weekend.

  My kids love these. There we probably around 4 cards that were duplicates but for the price and the fact that I have three boys who are in the beginning steps of collecting them, that wasn’t an issue at all. Thanks for the quick shipping and great cards.

  I’m not familiar with Pokémon cards so maybe I’m not the best reviewer for this item, but I will share my experience anyways since I value reviews so much myself when deciding whether or not to purchase an item. My 7 year old came home from school wanting Pokémon cards because another kid at school had some. I figured it was a passing fad, but when ahead and ordered this pack as a behavior incentive. For the price, it seemed like a good purchase. Comes with 50 cards. No case or carrying pouch or anything. Cards are loosely stored in plastic upon arrival. No complaints from my son.

    Not sure of the legitimacy of the cards
  
",3.0,mafesb2013,"Reviewed in the United States December 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  So I got a pack to see if anything, I would get some cards to start my LO collection. The packadges arrived open (the plastic cover they sent the cards in ( as I knew it was an asorted lot, did not expect for it to be seald in a foil bag).I was not sure of the legitimacy of the cards. Some people said they where fake. I ripped in 1/2 a energy card and found it to be legit, wiht the blac banding in the middle of 3 cards. Also did the light trick, and it was not translucent. Checked for typos (english is my second language.... so not sure how good I did there) and found none. Also checked for discrepancys with the cards I had purchased from Best Buy and seem almost identical.  But again, I do not grade, nor assess the legitimacy of cards as a living, but seemed legit to me.The cards are more than PL as stated in the listing, most have been played with and have scratches on them, so they really hold very little value, and I am sure that is the reason why they sell them for so cheap.Any ways, would love to hear from the seller, on my assesment of the product. But all and all I would not buy again from them, as it gives me the creeps to put fakes in my collection.

  Upon reading reviews given by other people, I was very nervous about receiving tons of duplicates when I ordered two of these packs from TicTakToys, I had recently accidentally destroyed the rest of my remaining childhood Pokemon cards and was feeling quite down, so I purchased these on impulse, just to start anew and to see if I could get back into collecting.I was pleasantly surprised at the outcome! Of course I had some duplicates, I'd say perhaps 10 duplicates per pack of 50 (meaning in the end I had about 20 duplicates, and this is if you count the cards with different art, from different sets, etc). The pack contained mostly common Pokemon cards with enough uncommon cards to keep me satisfied about my purchase as well as about 10-15 trainer cards and no energy cards. The cards were all in great condition and were all from the newer sets.All-in-all for someone like me, looking to start over it was a good purchase, and I'd definitely recommend it for someone who is just about to start out on Pokemon, for a younger child looking to get into card collecting, or as simple party favors for a Pokemon-themed party.If you have been collecting Pokemon cards for a while, then this is not the product for you as it does not contain any rare or highly desired cards.Happy buying!

  These were perfect! I bought them as party gifts for a Pokemon party and got them for a fraction of what I could buy them instore. There were not any really good cards on them i.e. shiny, foil, really rare cards, but for the price I never expected that. There weren't duplicates and there were about 10 trainers and a few every cards. The majority were Pokemon. Perfect for party favors...im debating on buying them again for my 7yr old that only want Pokemon cards for his birthday...

  Bought this knowing that it was for my 6yo daughter, and that these aren't gonna end up being in the best shape in a few months I'm sure. With that said... when purchasing this, don't expect much.We received the package timely, and my daughter promptly opened it. As soon as it was opened I knew right away that this was a series of Pokemon ""assorted"" together, so don't expect to pull that ""Ultra Rare"" Holo card, in fact, don't expect anything better than an uncommon stage one, because that's best you'll probably get.Again, these were more for entertainment value vs a collection value, so just remember you get what you pay for.

  So my son (6 years old)  had been begging me for pokemon cards- since I have no idea how any of it works, I thought the best thing to do was to buy an assortment so he can trade and so he wasn't left out if I got the wrong type... This pack had all types of cards from basic to the stages.  Although a little disappointed about duplicates, (There were about 5-7 repeats) I think of those as trading cards.

For the price, I knew there would be common and trainer cards, but almost every card is a trainer or basic, with 8 cards duplicates, some as many as 4 duplicates, for 30 or less HP. not a single uncommon card. 15 trainers not included in the duplicate list, so..all the others minus a few energy were duplicates. only 8 basic level cards not duplicates. going to need to purchase more sets but will never buy from this seller again..buyer beware! in the picture you see the low level duplicates on the upper right with trainers and the energy on bottom right, plus 8 decent cards ( but still not uncommon or worth much)

  I purchased these for one of my sons. I normally read reviews, but didn't think to do so for some stupid Pokemon cards. I ended up ordering a couple sets. I went to return this set and it said they were not returnable. That's when I looked at the reviews. He ended up opening them and the first two cards were dupes! After sorting thru them, he ended up with 21 different cards and 29 duplicates! Some of them had 4-6 of the same card. The other package I ordered (from another vendor) only had 1 set of dupes. I know there's always a chance of getting duplicates, but this is RIDICULOUS!

  It's been ten years since I collected pokemon cards, so I'll admit I don't know much. All I know is I miss the old original pokemon cards I had when I was a kid. My mom sold them at a yard sale lol. So my goal here was to get back into collecting possibly, but more importantly, get the originals.I understand that now there are new versions and editions? None the less, I want to collect the origonal pokemon, whether its the new cards or not.Here are the doubles I received...2 Solrock2 Phanpy2 Foongus2 Joltik2 Pansear2 Magnemite2 Zubat2 Timburr2 Riolu2 Trubbish (two different versions)4 Chimchar4 Patrat (one of them a different version)50 cards including: 40 common, 10 uncommon.What do you think? This IS out of 50 cards... and the price is cheap, but I'm honestly not sure what to think. If anyone recommends getting another order, or buying a different deck, please let me know. Since it's been so long, I'm new to this and I don't know how to get the original Pokemon if possible. By the way the shipping was fast and the cards seem to be in flawless shape as far as I can tell. I don't know if I can trust that they are ""random"" but the cards at least give me a  pleasant sense of nostalgia so I want to thank the sellers for that at least.

  I was disappointed in these packs(I ordered 2). The most recent pack we opened hapd 7 cards with duplicates and  14 cards were energy cards or trainer cards. The other pack had similar numbers.  My kids don't play the game often they just like to collect the cards and make ""families"" as they call them of evolving groups.  This wasn't the best pack for that. Almost half of the cards were pretty useless. That didn't include the duplicates of the ones they already have. I realize that is an inherent risk of Pokémon packs so it isn't a complaint per say just annoying because there were already so many useless cards without that being a factor. Maybe it is a seller problem. I have ordered 50 packs before and 90% or more were actual Pokémon and only 2-3 duplicate cards. I am going to look up the seller and update cause this was pretty lame from our perspective.

  I've had Pokemon cards since the original gen 1,  and thought it would be fun to get some more after 20 years.The older reviews were worrisome regarding the ridiculous overabundance of duplicates,  but more recent reviews mention a new seller and a positive result,  so I thought I'd take the gamble.It turned out great!  There were indeed cards from several generations including 1 2 and 3.  I actually got zero duplicates.  it was cool seeing all the new Pokemon/Support cards I've never seen before.

  My daughter has recently started collecting and trading Pokemon cards, so before digging around at the stores, I looked on Amazon to see what was out there, and boy is there a lot to choose from!  Since Amazon doesn't sell directly, we ordered one 50 pack of assorted cards from CCG Unlimited, and one from Toy Master to get a variety.  I chose them based on their seller rating and price, but most sets were priced comparably.  When they arrived, we were pleased that both packs had a good variety (very few duplicates).  To me it seem logical to buy smaller assorted card sets from various sellers rather than getting a large lot from a single seller (but this is coming from a ""new collector"").  Hope this helps.  Appreciate all the other reviewers.

  This was a pack of entirely pokemon (as opposed to trainer) cards. They came in mint condition, and many were from the Dragons Exalted series. There were a couple darks, one steel, and one dragon type. I was actually a little disappointed that they were all cards of pokemon because I'm used to the suspense of opening booster packs and possibly not getting good cards. Most of the pokemon were from the black and white generation, but some were earlier.The feel of the paper material seems different than it was in the 90s, so I was a little concerned that they were counterfeit, but I closely examined and can find no flaws.

  I had read other reviews saying that basically the whole set is a bunch of repeats so I ordered two sets for my younger cousin's Christmas.So in all I got 100 Pokémon cards and only 19 repeats. That makes it 81 Pokémon cards. Couldn't be happier.They came fairly quickly and were in PERFECT condition, I mean they literally look like they are brand new.Maybe the amount of repeats was the luck of the draw, but with the price that Pokémon cards are in stores I'd still say that this is a better deal.

The sellers don’t offer a refund or return. The worst part is the sellers advertise the cards as completely random, but the packaging is not official Pokémon packaging so it was obvious the cards were intentionally stacked. All of the trainer and energy cards were organized. There was nothing random about the deck. This whole product is a scam. I don’t even know how it made 4.5 stars.

  I've seen a lot of unhappy reviews on this, I dont know why. It is as described. A good mix of cards and great for gifts. Bought it for my daughter, she loved it. I dont know too much about these cards but from what I saw it looked like mainly, or fully common cards with little to no rare. But for the price not a big deal.

  Seller: TCGeneration I received it 2 days earlier than expected. The cards were in great conditions and I was satisfied with the packaging. Here's a detailed breakdown(I only list the cards that have duplicates):-Exactly 50 cards(Great!)-13 of the Pokemon cards are from the Black and White sets-10 trainer cards: 5 uncommon, 1 common(Duplicates: 2 Tool Scrapper, 3 Great Ball, 2 Switch)-20 Common cards(Duplicates: 3 Chinchou,2 Darumaka)-20 Uncommon cards(Duplicates: 3 Zweilous, 2 Skuntank, 2 Audino, 2 Lairon, 2 Bibarel)-Pokemons with the highest HP are Bibarel, Stunfisk, Wailmer(all with 100HP) Overall, the card set I got is quite good(maybe I'm one of the lucky ones). The only down side was there were 21 duplicates in the set. Most of them were uncommon Pokemon cards but that was still a lot of duplicates.

  Product had a lot of duplicates. I got these cards for me and my nephew. The cards also appear to be from 1 set, I purchased multiple packs hoping to get a wide variety and got the same cards and in 2 packs had at least 5 copies of 3 cards. A decent value but I wouldn’t recommended purchasing it. Would tell you to try a different one a little more pricey. Was expecting all commons but not repeat commons from 1 Set.

",4.0,Liv,"Reviewed in the United States May 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  Definitely worth the amount I paid for. Added quite a lot to my Pokemon card collection. Only issue was the fact that not only were there duplicates, there were 4-5 of the same card as well. Duplicates are fine, as I do have a friend that wants to try collecting as well, but when I start seeing 4 or 5 of the same exact card, that's a bit extensive. My advice would be to avoid doing that. Sure, you probably want to get rid of these cards but don't give one person the same card 4-5 times. On a positive note, cards came in beautiful condition, like they were right out of the package.

  You never truly know what you're going to get with a pack of these bad boys. The suspense is worth it alone!

I only had the benefit of receiving a couple of copies, one of them being 5 of the same card, maybe I'll get more lucky next time.

  Bit of advice, I checked the current seller before I bought (it's always changing) and they had really positive reviews. I know some people have had bad results with buying this so check the seller reviews first! Not the product reviews.That being saidIt came on time, packaged nicely in plastic wrap. All cards were in pristine condition and smelled like they were right out of the box. I had 6 double ups on Pokemon and two double ups on energies, one triple up on pokemon. It said there may be some duplicates so as to be expected. It also advertised some uncommon cards, which I received 10 and I thought that was a fairly decent ratio. I also received two reverse holo commons, which no holos were advertised or guaranteed, so that's a win. I got the pack out of nostalgia for when I collected as a kid and since it was only about $7.50 making the cards half price that of buying booster packs. I would have been blown away happy as a kid and it made for a fun opening.  Will probably use as rewards/gifts for my nephews.

  Thought this deal was too good to be true and I should have stuck with that. I bought (2) 50 packs for a total of 100 cards. I’d say anywhere from 30-40 of the cards were duplicates. When the notes states “Duplicates may occur”, it should say “Duplicates will occur.” I kind of figured I’d have a couple duplicates but not close to half of the 100 cards. Not only did I have a ton of duplicates, the duplicates were right behind each other which made it apparent this was done on purpose.

  I am very disappointed in this purchase.Out of the 50 cards in the order, we only received 22 unique cards, including 8 energy cards. That means there were only 14 unique character or trainer cards out of 50!  My child was very excited to jump-start her Pokémon card collection, but this was a complete waste of money and highly disappointing.After reading the fine print, it is spelled out that there *will* be duplicates in your order and that there is no maximum or minimum number of duplicates.  In other words, it is within their rights to ship you, say, 50 copies of one card. This item is also *not* returnable, so no matter how egregious the duplicates, you will be stuck with it.My order was fulfilled by The Game Capital, so I can only comment on this particular vendor and order. However, look closely at the fine print of this item and be aware that my experience would be considered ""normal"".  This feels like a way for shops to dump their undesirable cards and have a CYA statement to cover them legally (but not necessarily morally).TLDR; Avoid purchasing this. There are other slightly more expensive options here on Amazon that are far more satisfying.

  Cards are in great shape but there were alot of duplicates.  I was trying to get a good assortment for my son for his birthday and for the price this was a good choice.  There are about 25% duplicates and 90% of the cards are basic/lower level but he'll still be happy.

There were 10 trainer & energy cards, which I don’t know how to tell them I don’t want. Also used to be a lot of duplicates. This time NO DUPLICATES!!!  OUT OF THE 40 CARDS, THIS WAS A PERFECT ORDER!! Thank you!! I soon am going to place another order as a gift. Hope the same or with (no energy cards!!).  Great job guys!

  My son is upset bc these cards contain no energy cards.  He saved his money and picked these bc they said they had an assortment of regular and energy cards.  There are 0 energy cards.  I logged on to Amazon to return these and it says they cannot be returned and lists no other option - I will be calling Amazon in the morning.  They were only $7 but this is a lot to a 5 year old boy who has been saving his money to buy Pokémon cards and he expected to get what was in the description.  He would have chose another seller to purchase from if he had known this.

My son is new to Pokémon, so I didn’t care much about if the Pokémon he got were the “good ones” but the fact that almost all of the Pokémon cards had duplicates (most were duplicates of 3 or 4!) was pretty disappointing.

    Unsure of Who Designed These Cards, but They Know Nothing About Pokemon
  
",1.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  Upon opening my 5 packs, I received 257 cards. At first I was excited that I received more than I bought until I realized the issues with the cards. Below you will find a breakdown of some issues:Type Amounts Received:grass - 44Psychic - 21Dark - 13Fire - 20Normal - 33Water - 22Fighting - 22Trainer - 43Steel - 21Fairy - 7Electric - 11Ice - 0Poison - 0Flying - 0Bug - 0Rock - 0Ghost - 0Dragon - 0Ground - 0I received 0 foil or special cards out of the 257 received total.That wasn't the only issue. I counted 70 cards that the Pokemon typing were incorrect just based on my knowledge from years of being exposed to it. The move types of 80% of the cards weren't the correct typing or even correct Pokemon to use them. I did actually receive ice types, ground types, rock types, etc. But they were all labelled water or fighting type Pokemon.Like I said in the title, whoever designed these cards has no clue about Pokemon and doesn't even do basic research about the item they are selling. This is a slander on the Pokemon name.

I was disappointed as the write up said no duplicates when purchased (I see that has since been updated). It feels a bit like cast offs from others’ sets. Would not recommend if your kids already have cards. Would rather have spent the money on fewer, nicer cards.

  Disappointed is an understatement. First it said they are new - but now the order page is saying it's ""new - used mint-like condition""Which one is it??  New or used?  Quality is good, but poor packaging says used!The cards are def. nothing special - it's like they are just the unwanted extras from sets that someone didn't want.There are only three duplicates - was expecting more duplicates. There's nothing that makes this set great - especially for the price.It also came just piled together stuffed in a grey shipping bag. (the way I would expect as if they were a pile of opened, unwanted extra cards)And can't even return them. When I go to that option - it says This item isn't eligible for return - yet it says return window closed on Jan 31, 2017And i'm writing this review on Dec. 3rd, 2016.  Feels like a scam - and I just got ripped off.  It shows that it was Sold by MTGbiz - yet when I went back to the page I ordered, it shows someone else.  Just frustrated and disappointed with it.

  My co-workers daughter is autistic and loves Pokemon so I decided to get her some Pokemon cards and a case for them. Before I ordered I read the reviews. They were all good and it said there may be duplicates inside and that the cards would total 50. Every review I read about the count they got their 50. The cards were all unwrapped except 1 and the count was only 43. If it says 50 and gives a price and I pay the price for 50, thats what I should've gotten. I tried to go to return policy to see if I could contact the seller to see if I could get the remaining cards and a big box pops up with ""item not returnable"" in it. I don't want to return them because I got them for someone. I really don't want to give them to her this way (open) but I am because she loves them. Really not a good gift to send straight to someone. They need to come directly to you so you can make them presentable.

    Decription should be a little more specific, or assorted better.

  I ordered this wanting base set or original cards. Hoping out of 50 I would get at least one. I didn't get even one. Couple repeats and triples. I think its the same gable to get a pack you have 0 idea of what you are going to get. In my opinion if people are going to do an assortment they should at least sort by generation and perhaps THEN say ""random"" but it was a huge let down not getting even one from the generation I wanted out of 50. However, they came in near mint to mint condition. Sadly they weren't even close to what I wanted. HUGE GAMBLE at this.

    Preferred this vendor

  Writing this review for vendor, not product. Though product good as well. I purchased one pack from CoolStuffIncGames (this vendor) and another (Planet Comics). The CoolStuff pack arrived sooner, wrapped nicely and all card in great shape (could not tell any were used). No energy cards, and only a few items, plus very few duplicates. More importantly, this pack came with seven non-basic cards.  These are for my kids, so I have no idea what the card levels are - but there were seven stage ones cards, whereas, the pack I purchased form the other vendor were all basic and included seven energy cards and several items. Note: other vendor cards also were in like new shape. Overall, if I were to purchase again and as between the two, I would purchase from CoolStuffIncGames.

  Bought this set for my son who is getting into Pokemon, mainly because his classmates are starting to trade these at school. With that in mind we bought this to give his collection a jump start and it was a good mix for that purpose. Unlike some negative reviews about duplicates we did not get any duplicates. Out of the 50 cards we had a handful of energy cards and a few trainer cards, the rest were basic Pokemon cards. So do not expect to find any rare cards here, just basic ones.

  This is better than a booster pack. A booster pack contains 9 cards for the price of $4. This was 50 cards for a little more than $6. There was one pokemon card in which there were 4 copies of, and another triple of another card, and two doubles. There were a great variety from all generations. I even got some cards that I recognized from when I was a kid, from the very first set of pokemon cards when it came into existence. There was no energy cards and only 3 trainer cards. I really enjoyed this purchase and might buy again in the future. There was even one dark and steel pokemon card. The only complainant that I have is that there was no electric pokemon card in my mix. Besides that this is well worth the money.

  Some look very different from the rest of the cards we received, wondering if they’re knockoffs. Also, had some duplicates and most were just basic pokemon. The price was right and since it came from Easter Bunny I cannot return them.

  I received the 50 card lot knowing that everything was going to be randomly selected and could result in doubles. I was surprised to see I had gotten all the first original fossil, basic set 1 & 2, jungle, and 1 gym heroes cards. No cards from the new era after Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal. Nothing from Diamond and Pearl. All these cards were recognizable and I do not think I received any duplicates. A lot of normal 1st level cards such as Pidgey, Abra, Lickitung(1st edition), a Venomoth nonholo, Tentacool, Spearow(1st edition), and so on. The gym hero card was Kogas Golbat. I never got into those cards, but was delighted to receive at least 1 out of all the series I didn't collect. I am restarting my collection and this was certainly a good start to a new binder. Condition is from played/near mint to mint. 1 or 2 cards had creases or scratches. Can't expect these cards to be brand new out of the booster pack/box untouched and perfect. They are however in very very good condition for being in someones collection. Definitely brought back memories and for the price, it is certainly worth 5-7 bucks for 50 random cards if you don't get a lot of duplicates.
