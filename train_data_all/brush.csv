  Great brush for helping to style curls. I make sure to use a wet brush first to detangle; I would not recommend this brush for detangling- only for styling.

  I’ve had this brush for over 5 years and it has transformed my hair care process. I am African American with very thick and long natural hair. Detangling my hair was a nightmare before this brush. This really gets the job done and it has held up beautifully over the years. I am purchasing another one after someone else used mine and caused one row of bristles to retract. I could probably fix it but I figure it’s time for a new brush after 5 years. It still looks and works great after all that time. It fully set angles my hair with no pain or snags. - I always use it on wet/slippery Hair and I don’t recommend detangling dry hair.

  Used for my hair after the shower/ before blowdrying. Untangled my hair pulling away from my scalp to create volume.Created too much frizz, even with anti-frizz products. Curls would lose their shape.My hair has different sections of curls, 3a in the front, 3c on the sides near my ears, and 3b everywhere else.Finger detangling works better for me because I know where my curl patterns are.Would not buy again.

  This is a good brush for creating a nice curl pattern AFTER strangling. This did not work well to detangle my hair. I had to use a wide tooth comb before using this. I heard others say they removed some rows of teeth for better detangling. I have not figured out how to do this.

  Great brush for thick hair and curls but once your ready to give it a good clean and pull it apart it won’t go back after the second/ third time taking it apart! It happened to my old old and now is happening to my new one! The only way to get a really good clean is to take it apart since it holds A LOT product AND hair! YUCK! See the dilemma? Like who wants product build up on their shiny locks! Not I!! Honestly it’s not the best option and you’ll do better to get yourself something that can cleaned easily because after while it gets harder and harder until it’s nearly impossible to put it back together.

  I had researched the deman for months before purchasing. Deman brush has cut my styling time in half, would definitely recommend. Great brush to use once product is applied for even distribution and to enhance curly pattern.I would not recommend to use as a detangler brush.Detangle hair prior, apply products, split hair in sections, then use deman brush. Scrunch hair when done and dry your hair using method of choice.

    My 3b hair loves it!
  
",5.0,MariaTop Contributor: Pets,"Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  I can’t believe I went my entire life without using this! I have 3b hair that responds well to having the product brushed into it (smoother, less wet/dry frizz), but which then needs a little help clumping back up afterwards (scrunching). I tried using this brush a few different ways, and have had fantastic results!1) I’ve “modified” my Denman by removing every other row. You can do this by pushing the portion holding the bristles up from the top, and then pulling the teeth out. (You’ll see two bumps marked by D on the top, this is the section that pulls out and unrolls to release the teeth).2) I detangle my hair with a wet brush first, which I think is common for hair in the 2/3 range. If I try to detangle my hair with this, it doesn’t work very well, although I’ve heard it does work in this capacity for 4 type hair!3) If I have more time, I go section by section, brushing away from my head, twisting  and scrunching as I go (Lots of great videos on this “standard” usage online). This always gives me the best results4) If I’m short on time, I tilt my head so that the section I’m brushing isn't flat against my head, and brush through my hair, twisting at the end, and giving a slight shake before scrunching. This is super fast (think a minute or two) but gives me hair that’s about 90% as good (I need to fluff a bit more for volume).I put product into my hair before using this (raking and praying hands), and add a tiny bit of watered down gel to scrunch up after brushing (making sure I hear squishing).

  I bought this because it’s been raved about everywhere. I have transitioning hair from relaxed to natural about a year in and i don’t use it to detangle first. It’s a little to rough for my hair right now but I’m hopeful that it’ll get more use once I’m fully natural. I do use it but I usually detangle first with my wet brush and then after most of the tangles are out use this one as like a second detangle and smoother before I do my twists. Trying to detangle with only this rips my hair out. Just for reference I’m a year into a hopefully 2.5 year transition from relaxed hair. I have about 4-5 inches of natural hair grown in that looks like it may be 4b but I won’t know for sure until I’m fully natural. I’ve been relaxed since I was a little girl so I don’t know what my true natural texture is. For a full natural it will probably be great but right now it’s too harsh especially where my two textures meet to use for detangling. I do have a natural friend though who it works great for.

  Best used when hair is still freshly wet, after detangling hair with a wide comb. Using hair products before or after is to your preference, I find that brushing before my usual products helped me out more with definition. **TIP: when brushing, do it in individual sections and most importantly do it in a curling motion, as if you're curling your hair with a heat wand.**Gave my curls more definition. There are ways to modify to your liking by removing the bristles (I recommend youtube for help with that, there are lots of videos on it).The best advice I can give is to try different things with it to see what works out better for you.

  I just don’t get this thing, y’all. I’ve tried it several times with different techniques and I just haven’t achieved the kind of curls other women have described. It is A LOT of work. My curls naturally clump so maybe this is unnecessary and I’m just creating more work for myself? I don’t know. There are definitely areas that I’ve noticed curling better when I use this exactly right, like the bottom layer of my hair. But for the most part, it makes the bottom 1/2-3/4 of my hair curl more uniformly but it flattens the top. I’m just really not sure it’s worth the extra steps. I’ll keep trying and I’ll update my review if I have better success!Tips: Make sure your hair is fully detangled before you use this thing or you will pull your hair out! The brush also gets very slippery with all the water and product on it, so I’d keep a towel or T-shirt nearby to wipe it and your hands on periodically.

  I absolutely love this brush!!! I have natural 4b/4c hair and use it on my wet hair. When starting from end and working to the root, it does wonders at detangling. The best part is how it brings out my curls. I have soft, fluffy hair, but when I brush it with this, I can actually see defined curls. I pair it with a curl cream or moisturizer spray and it's just the best thing ever. I don't travel without it and have recommended it to all of my natural friends.

  I was having issues with my curls being stringy, I couldn’t get them to clump. I saw in Instagram this brush helps with that so I purchased one. I have used it twice and my hair finally clumped. I noticed more clumps the second time so I think with practice it’ll do what I need. Added bonus it helped with frizziness as well. I read if your hair is frizzy while wet it’ll style that way and I noticed this controls frizz while clumping the curl.

    Curly Hair Magic!
  
",5.0,Claudia,"Reviewed in the United States December 18, 2017","









  
  
    
  I love this brush. I got it after seeing a few YouTubers mention that it helped define your curls and it totally does. I have curly hair that ranges from 3B/3C and every once in a while my curl pattern is a bit erratic and this brush has definitely helped me get better defined and consistent looking curls. I use it when I'm still in the shower (and done conditioning) or at least when my hair is still pretty wet when I get out. You can customize it and remove some of the rows of teeth in the brush if your hair is a bit more kinky or if it's difficult to detangle.

I’ve used several different types of brushes and combs before trying this one. Once I wet his hair with a detangling spray, the denman brush glides through his hair easily without snagging or causing pain. Hair time goes much smoother now! And his curls look fabulous.

  I haven’t had this brush for that long, and my hair is actually naturally very soft and yet it hasn’t been able to withstand time. I don’t use it that often because I find that finger detangling keeps my curls in their natural pattern rather than separating them so forcefully. I think this brush is best for women with very little curl pattern or wavy hair because this is clearly not a curly girl tool. Especially given my hair isn’t Afro textured is especially alarming because I’m sure their consumers are largely made of people with that texture so I can only imagine how little use they must get out of this product. I think it helps create curls if you don’t have any, but ladies and gents if you do have actual curls then why would you want to separate them??? Finger detangle people. Always gives me better results.

I’ve always had a tough time getting the right brush to de tangle my hair without pulling out a lot of hair. The denman brush runs smoothly through my hair while comfortably de tangling. I also love how it defines my curls during styling. And to top it off I’m able to brush through my 8 year olds long curly hair without her having a fit. Like I said I’m in love with this brush. I’ll probably be ordering extra. If you’re looking for a sign here it is order your brush today

  I bought this brush after reading about it on Pinterest.  I was skeptical b/c I was always told ""don't brush curly hair."" This specifically said to use it on wet hair.  I've used it in the a.m. on my wet hair the last 2 days. It detangled well, there was no tugging at knots, and I had less hair breakage showing in the brush compared to using my wide toothed comb.  I used my hair gel product as usual (bounce curl light creme gel).  My hair has looked so good the past 2 days! (IMO anyway).  I could see a difference in the curls and the volume.  I've even considered cancelling my Devacut appt b/c  my hair has looked so good.  But then I thought, the cut plus this brush should make it even better.  Only other different thing I did besides using this brush is a new hairdryer with a fabulous diffuser.  Best diffuser I've ever used.  A nice big ""bowl"" to hold and dry your hair.  These 2 items make a great team for my curly hair.  Hairdryer bought from Amazon too (Nition Negative Ions Ceramic Hairdryer in Champagne Gold).

I also use it after applying dry shampoo, it helps spreading the dry shampoo all over my hair.Great for both wet and dry hair. Easy to wash and dry.

  I read about this brush in a magazine - a dermatologist was saying that she used this on her hair every night.  When I received it, I was stunned at its weight...that handle is solid metal.  The bristles are very stiff BUT, I have never had a brush make my scalp feel the way this one does.  I am someone who likes the feel of pressure on my scalp and after running this brush all over it (over the sides, underneath, over the top) my scalp has never felt so good! If your scalp is tender, this may not be the brush for you, if you like scalp massages, etc, this is the brush for you. You also can't beat the price.  I might even be giving this to all my friends for Christmas.  I don't think I would use this to style my hair as I'm blow drying, but it works beautifully when I'm brushing hair oil through as an overnight conditioner. Totally worth it!

Was I ever glad to see it here and YES it is the same one I have had for 20 years. It is my 4th one and the only problems I've ever had is that the handle broke on 2 of my first ones (which fit perfectly in my purse without the handle so not that big a problem) and that my husband likes to take it, use it and put it away in his drawer. Had to get him one of his own. They last for about 10 years before the rubber starts to break down. Absolutly love this brush. Very easy to keep clean. Ordered 2 so I will never have to worry about finding it again (hopefully). 20 more years of use to go.

  I might be one of only a handful that do not like this brush, but alas, I fear I do not. I have very fine, curly hair that admittedly tangles easily, and this brush snags on my hair something awful when styling. No matter how much product I use, I have breakage. I had at least twice as much fall while styling with the Denman as when I was detangling my hair with a different brush. This is also after taking out 3 rows of tines after it happened the first time I used it.Another thing, my curls seemed to clump better using the brush. However, my hair is very curly (3B/3C) and my ends basically curled around themselves, resulting in increased shrinkage and a look far more ""precious"" than I'd like. I may give it another go, see if a different technique might help, but after a couple uses, I'm not yet a fan.

My husband picked it out for me and it's probably the best hair-related gift I've received so far. The bristles are soft and don't tug harshly on my hair, so detangling has become less of a nightmare and  more of an enjoyable self-care activity. I could not recommend purchasing this brush more.

  So far so good, This brush feels like a quality product. The head and bristles are very well made and heavy so they really get into your hair. The only issue I have is the proportionately skinny handle part. Compared to the brush head the handle is very light and narrow making it feel top-heavy and some have even posted about the handle snapping. For my hair, it won't be a problem. But for someone with thicker denser hair, they might snap the handle. I'm very happy with the brush and look forward to using it for years!

  My mom and I love this brush, but I love it the most. I have thick, medium length 4B/C hair. This brush has weight and it is strong. I have used it every day since I received it earlier this week. I brush each quarter-section of my hair with it 50x, there is very little breakage and the brush itself is holding up fabulously. This is the first detangling brush that I have ever used that hasn't broken in my hair, even the bristles are still in perfect condition. I used it on my mom's hair too and she wants one. I am also buying a few to make care packages for my aunts. I tried looking for this same brush at my local beauty store tonight, and they had nothing by Denman. Not even the local Target, Walmart, Rite Aid, CVS, or Walgreens had it either. I love this brush and it is worth the price to have it. Just for the heck of it, I am getting an extra one for my use.Back to the use. Not only does the Denman Heavy Duty, 9-Row Styling brush successfully detangle my hair, but I have seen less breakage and hair loss using it these last few days than any comb or brush I have used before. The massage it gives my scalp is invigorating and delightful,. I continue to feel the tingling sensations for 30-60 minutes after. The design evenly distributes oil to every strand of hair, and the strong-non scratchy- bristles uplift any dandruff from the scalp, relieving itching. After using, my hair is SO much easier to manage. I'm between hair styles right now, so I am just safety braiding my hair in quarters at night after scalp treating, hair conditioning, and brushing.If brushing my hair and braiding it every night will make it grow longer, I will do it as long as this brush continues to be manufactured. My goal is to grow my hair past my shoulder blades. Right now, it reaches a little more than half way down the back of my neck.  Thanks to my current hair products (Fantasia Naturals Tea Tree Oil line, and an essential oil mixture (Tea Tree Oil, Peppermint Oil, Aloe Vera Oil) with a Fractionated Coconut Oil base) and this brush, I have found myself needing to wash my hair less and less. I used to have to wash it once or twice a week due to excessive dandruff and itching (drying the hair strands and my scalp excessively), now I have been able to reduce it to once a month and my hair stays clean. My hair has never been healthier and I am seeing less split ends. Thanks to this brush, I don't need combs for anything other than making parts. I am so glad I will never see a 3"" hair ball again.

  I have the heavy-weight 9-row brush. It is heavy, but I wouldn't say it makes brushing or blowdrying my hair more difficult. In fact, I think it encourages softer brushing since you can sort of let gravity take control instead of ripping the brush through your hair. For blowdrying, the brush provides plenty of tension for blowdrying, and does a good job of reaching the scalp. Overall this is a really great brush and I look forward to years of use!

My review is not for those who are interested in the ability and versatility of this brush because I did not use it. Long story short, if I am going to purchase a Denman brush at a Denman price (at least it was the same price at the time of purchase) on a non-Denman site, that the whole brush, including the bristle, be a Denman. Honesty gets you further, and this brush was not an honest exchange. Thankfully, the refund was.

  I think I would really like this brush; it feels good to use and leaves my hair feeling soft when paired with my davines products; but I've only used it twice (after detangling with a good wide toothed comb), and the bristles and their backing already appear to be separating from the brush handle. Maybe mine just wasn't glued well, but after reading multiple articles on the best brushes for curly hair, and this being highly rated on each one, I expected better. I'll be super dissapointed if the bristles and backing fully come away from the handle like your every day cheap hair brush; as this was an issue I was hoping to avoid when I chose this over just buying another Wet brush or some such thing.

  I love this brush for defining my 3b natural curls, the only thing I didn't like was that the gold ""Denman"" text on the brush rubbed off pretty much immediately during the first use. Like I could gently rub it with my finger and it would come off which I thought was really strange. I don't know what's in the ink so I don't exactly want it on my hands/hair or wherever it's gone, but it doesn't impact the functionality of the brush so it's not a big deal.

    Worked wonders for my 3a curls after I removed a few rows and modified the handle
  
",5.0,TiffanyTop Contributor: Makeup,"Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2019","









  
  
    
  I have long, curly 3a hair and have long struggled with finding the right routine. I recently heard about these brushes and decided to give it a try. I tried it as-is for a couple weeks, but it gave me zero clumps and my hair didn’t look good. I then removed a few rows- which was easy and took less than 5 minutes - and that has helped a lot. I get better clumps now and it detangles quickly and easily without hassle. Since I brush in the shower while conditioner is on my hair, the brush was constantly flying out of my hand. Nothing helped the grip, so I bought some of the cohesive bandage stuff they wrap you with at the doctor’s office after they take blood. It’s also called vet tape sometimes. I wrapped a bit of this around the handle super tightly, went around about 4 times and then gave it a good squish. This has completely solved the grip problem for me, and it has held up well so far for several weeks of being soaking wet and conditioner-coated in the shower without issue. I’m sure eventually I’ll need to wrap it with fresh stuff, but the tape is cheap and comes in big rolls, so it’s worth it. I’m very happy with my brush!

This is also the only brush has manipulates both of our curls without needed additional product (I use a leave-in to help detangle, fingers, then this brush.

  I have thick 4c hair.  It's about a foot long stretched.  The bristles have a lot of 'give' making for a much gentler detangling process.  I think the handle on this brush needs grip or texture.  I use slippery products in my hair to detangle it.  The smooth finish on this brush makes it difficult to hold when my hands are slick.  Overall, I like how it glides through my hair once detangled.

  My old brush was between 45 and 50 years old and I have been looking to replace for several years.  I was really happy to finally find what appeared to be the exact same brush, although I could not be 100% sure as the name on the old brush could no longer be read.  When I got this new brush - it really appears to be exactly the same (except I got the 7 row brush - not the 9 row).  My original blue is not available but the black is fine.  Otherwise, the construction appears to be exactly the same.  Based on how well my  original brush lasted, I am sure I will never need another brush.

  I had a Denman Brush for almost 20 years. It survived daily blow drying, hairspray, dry shampoo, gels, wet hair, dry hair, soaking to remove hair products and lots of traveling. I love this brush. It fits comfortably in your hand and works well in thick or thin, curly or straight, or young or old hair. Finally, after much abuse, I decided to replace my brush and ordered the exact same one. I love it.

  I have long curly hair that I have to brush out very carefully while wet and covered in great big gobs of leave-in conditioner.  I used to use a comb and pulled out so much hair that it was quite frightening.  Enter the Denman brush... upon recommendation of Teri LaFlesh and her book Curly Like Me.  The brush is every bit as awesome as she describes it.  It is sturdy and made of great quality hard plastic, the bristles are smooth and are embedded into a cushiony rubber base, but the very best part is that you can easily slide the rubber cushion from the handle, pop all the rows of bristles out and clean the brush in a jiffy.I am so happy with my Denman brush!It is a cinch to wash and to keep clean, it doesn't pull my hair out by the handful and even though my fine hair knots easily, this size brush works absolutely perfectly and is easy to stash in a carry-on.  I expected it to cost around $45 but it was extremely affordably priced.You cannot go wrong with a Denman!

  The denman brush has completely changed the way I style my curly hair. Nothing distributes product as well as a denman brush. I get comparable definition when I use the denman as when I would when I finger curl. Instead of finger curling or just scrunching, I brush and twirl with the denman, which saves time and reduces frizz. It is very easy and quick to do. I like how you can customize the brush by popping out rows of bristles, and that you can take the brush apart for cleaning. I read that the bristles are vinyl, which is why they are so smoothing to the hair. 100% worth the money.

  This has got to be my favorite and best brush I've ever used to detangle wet curly kinky hair. Also fast and easy to detangle and dry hair with a blow dryer. The bristles also feel great on your scalp not too hard or iritating. Love the beautiful color I chose as well.

  After years of straightening my hair, I've gone back to my curly/wavy hair. I'm getting so confused on products to use, the curly girl method, etc. I didn't think it was a good idea to BRUSH your curly/wavy hair, but this is a miracle brush for me. After watching YouTube videos, I found the correct way to use the Denman brush and my hair is curlier than ever and keeps a curl. LOVE this brush. Well worth the price. Love my curls now.

  I had purchased another Denman brush prior to this one and I was extremely disappointed, the bristles kept falling out one by one and I was upset because I paid quite a bit for it. This one though! It works extremely well with pulling through my hair and untangling without any hassle and in fact gives my hair a great curl pattern

  I saw so many curly girls raving about this brush! Of course it was a must have for me; although, it is a very durable and well made brush I don't see how it really differs much from any other brush.  I used to brush my curls out in the shower while conditioning with a wide tooth comb and feel like I had the same results as I do with this brush. Nothing too spectacular really about it, but it is made to hold up keeping it on the shower so that's a plus!  I gave it 4 stars, only because I don't see how it really is any different from any other same type of bristled brush. Good quality and shipped super fast. Even though I may use it every now and then I still use my wide tooth comb more often.

    Best curly hair styling brush
  
",5.0,Marisa M,"Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2019","









  
  
    
  I'm a curly girl with 3b curl type. I use the Denman brush after I have detangled my wet curls and applied cream or mousse and gel. I stretch out the curl with the brush and scrunch it. The curls dry bouncy and shorter after using the brush and the curls look really defined. I was recommended this brush by another curly girl and it was so much fun to try this method of turning the brush under the curl, stretching it out and then letting go and shaking the curl to recoil. This is one of two brushes that I use (the other being a gentle wet brush). I would not use any brush to detangle curls, I use my hands only as per the recommendation of the curly girl method. I am very careful to not damage my hair. Would recommend this brush and method!

  I have used these Denman brushes for about 30 years, got my first one in England many years ago. Glad to know they still make them like they used to. Other brushes in stores look similar but the Denmans I think are just better feeling, nicely balanced in the hand, the correct spacing on the rows, just perfect. They are a little hard to find in stores in California these days so great that they can be had on Amazon. I bought two and still have my 15 year old one. The rubber gets a little stiffer after that long but I still like it. I would have one suggestion: I drill a large hole in the end of the plastic handle so I can hang it on a hook on the wall. It would be nice if it came with a hole already.

  This product I have to say was just okay. After hearing all the excellent reviews about it I wanted to see for myself. I heard that this brush was perfect for better curls on curly hairstyles. However when using this brush, it completely wiped out my curls. I feel like you have to have a certain hair texture in order to get your curl to pop, and maybe mines wasn't the right type. I am a African American female with natural kinky hair. After detangling my hair and adding product I used this brush and my curl pattern was completely gone. This brush was also super heavy weight which I was not a fan of. You have to be super gentle with this. Overall this product gets 3 stars as it did not work for me :/

  I've been using Denman brushes for at least 20 years. I had purchased this exact item and thought the price was too good to be true but thought I'd give it a shot. This is definitely a fake. The bristles were not smooth...they scratched my scalp and tore some of my hair out and the rubber started to come apart with the first few uses. BUYER BEWARE! Paying for an actual Denman brush through the Denman store here on Amazon is worth the expense. I know my next brush will last another 8+ years.

  This brush is amazing! As a woman with thick, long, curly hair I typically avoided using a brush on my wet hair, and definitely never dry. However, after watching a several videos on YouTube of people trying out the brush I figured I would give it a try. It's so cheap, it's worth the investment. I have a 7 row brush. The Denman brush is now a permanent part of my hair washing routine. I use it during my shower, and after to brush my hair styling products throughout my hair. This brush works so well to ensure I fully detangle my hair before it dries. After brushing, I get big beautiful curls, and don't have to worry about any knots, or kinks ruining my hair style.

  This brush is a dream come true.  The bristles do not fall out as do the cheaper versions.  My hair is thin, fine and tangles very easily.  Wet or dry, this brush just glides through my hair addressing the knots painlessly and effortlessly.  The expensive boar bristle brushes never felt like nor were they going through my fine, limp hair as well as being too short to touch my scalp.  I purchased one to use on my doodle and poodle and it does a fantastic job and the dogs are so much happier with it than the wire brush.  I do not tend to write reviews unless a product is excellent, terrible or can be used in a way that can become a choking hazzard for pets and/or infants and toddlers.  For me to write this brush is excellent is  really saying a lot!!!

    Defines Curls beautifully and minimizes frizz
  
",5.0,MHerman,"Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  I absolutely LOOVVVEEE this brush!!! It defines curl clumps incredibly. As you can see from my pics above, it makes a huge difference. The first pic is just using my regular wet brush which gives nice curls but they are frizzy and less voluminous. The 2nd pic is with the Denman brush and the curls are way more defined, shiny, and virtually no frizz. The only difference in my hair routine for both pics is just slightly more gel in the 2nd pic for more hold, so the brush definitely is the reason for the major improvement. The brush is also really cool cause you can remove the bristle pad from the brush and take out some of the teeth to experiment with the size of the curl clumps but I love the result as is. If you need suggestions for styling naturally curly hair with a Denman brush, I highly recommend @manesbymel or @jaymejo on youtube. Hope this helps!

  This brush lives to it's weight description. It feels well-built and feels comfortable in your hands. The ""smooth, round-edged pins"" are not so gentle on my scalp. I can't comb my hair using the handle as that puts too much pressure on the pins which press into my scalp. Instead I have to hold the brush by the head and use it that way so that I can adjust the pressure while combing. The pins are really stiff if you're looking for a stiff brush...Overall, I will continue to use this brush, but I think it's just okay.

",5.0,J. Wall,"Reviewed in the United States August 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  I would never have thought that I would spend almost 20 bucks for a hairbrush, but after seeing so many curly girls swear by the darned thing for wet brushing leave-ins and curl shaping, I had to try it and I’m really glad that I did. I feel that this was a great investment, as it is sturdy (I was on my 3rd brush of my former favorite brand, after having dropped them and the plastic handles broke off). This brush has only hit the floors couple of times because my hand was slick from the leave in conditioner. How you run it through your hair determines the volume of your curls. I have a flat spot on the crown of my head, and wet brushing it straight up and then shaking it out, I have volume I hadn’t achieved before.I’ve been using this brush religiously since early April and don’t have anything bad to say about it. If you are getting into embracing the beauty of your natural curls, I recommend this brush highly! It is built for the long haul!

  Buyer Beware! I struggle to even call this a genuine Denman brush, as I grew up using them all my life. I purchased this 7 row and after I pulled the rubber out to modify it, it WILL NOT go back into place. I've done absolutely everything I could, even had my husband do it in case I was just losing my mind over nothing. Nope, according to the denman website, we were doing everything right. I looked at YouTube tutorials, and read every instruction I could. Not a single thing on this issue. Everyone seems to be able to slide the rubber back into the plastic brush handle except for us! We wet the rubber in hopes that it would slide easier. It got halfway in with a full body weight of pressure! We tried so hard to push it in the rubber bowed and flew out of the freaking thing! All our hard work, undone. I was so upset. But as stubborn as I am, I didn't give up. My last resort was to apply coconut oil to both the rubber and plastic ledges. After more carefully applied body weight pressure, and 38 minutes of it might I add, it is now ALMOST all the way in. Forget the last inch. This literally got ONE use and is complete garbage now bc the exposed inner plastic of the brush handle will catch on my hair and break my hair if I try to use it the way it is. I'd give this 0 stars if I could. And possibly the middle finger.

    Amazing brush!
  
",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2018","









  
  
    
  To start off, I’d like to say that this brush is amazing. It has changed my hair completely and I use it in curly hair routine almost every single day. I have very thick, course hair that I have find trouble finding good products for, so I am happy that I found out about the Denman brush. The purpose of the Denman brush is to, “define curls, detangle, and smooth the hair,” and I can confirm that the description is accurate, and this brush successfully does what it’s supposed to do. This is gentle alternative of detangling curly hair than a regular paddle brush, which is a big NO for curly girls because paddle brushes can cause damage and breakage to already naturally dry curly hair. The Denman Brush has made it easy for me to get big knots out of my hair without causing split-ends. It also causes my hair to clump together and I love how defined my curls come out because of this brush. There are seven rows on the rubber pad and these rows can be removed to create bigger or smaller curl clumps depending on how many rows are kept in. I love that this brush creates such beautiful curls instead of stringy looking hair. I used to have trouble with my hair never clumping together and it would basically look like “Ramen Noodle” hair, but this brush solved this issue. The Denman brush also smoothens my hair and create a uniform sleek curl and prevents my hair to frizz up. The description also says that this brush is, “ideal for creating tight curls, root lift or for shorter hair,” and I’m happy to agree with this statement as well. My curls do look tighter and have more of a coil when I use this brush in a certain way. I’ve noticed that a lot of people don’t know how to use a Denman brush to create coils and will quickly give it a bad review, but there is a specific way to use it. To achieve coily curls, I brush my hair from underneath and start turning the brush to make a spiral. In other words, I coil my hair around the brush. It’s basically the same process as curling your hair with a flat iron. It also does cause my roots to be more voluminous and prevents my hair from becoming flat and sad. I highly recommend the Denman brush to every curly-headed girl out there because I strongly believe that I will become your best friend and make your curly hair routine way easier.

  I heard so many of the natural hair girls on the Internets talk about this brush when i first went natural, but didn't think it would be effective for my hair type. Since purchasing I have used it to detangle a few times and it gets through my kinky 4c hair pretty well. It doesn't rip my hair out, which I chalk up to both the brush and patience when detangling kinky hair. I wish there was a better grip on the handle though. I have sent it flying across the room a couple times when the amount of product on my hands made holding it comically difficult.

  This isn't the quality I expected for a twenty dollar brush. The edges of the rubber are ragged, and the rubber itself is so soft that I'm afraid to try to slide it out of the handle like you are supposed to be able to do. The handle itself feels sturdy, but I don't think the rubber part of this brush will last very long before the top tears away from the sides that hold it in the handle. I'll be returning this.

  There simply isn't a better brush on the market. It's tried and true.  It stimulates hair growth, decreases static and frizz in the hair because of the red rubber material, great for the toughest of tangles. The very best features are it's construction. It's ingenious! My mother has had the same denman for over ten years. It's basically indestructible. Unless you torch it lol! Every single piece in this brush is removable for sterilization.  I'd mourn greatly if denman ever stopped making this brush. I use the heavy duty one as my hair is very thick; that one is black and white but this is perfect for medium thick to fine hair. Get a denman. Every house should have one, especially mixed race children. Parents you'll bless the day you purchased it!

  This brush was good for detangling my 2b hair. I hate washing my hair because it is such a pain to detangle it afterwards. Tried this after reading some curly girl articles. I agree with many of the reviews that this may not be authentic. Seems very plastic and poorly made for a real Denman. The 7 row is still too small, and my hand hurt before I was done combing through my wet hair. This is too expensive for the quality. You can get a knockoff Denman at Walmart for a couple bucks.  I may try ordering one from the Denman website.

  So if you have a curly lions mane you NEED this brush!!! I get the definition, the volume and bounce i want without frizz! It distributes your product like a champ but it is not to be used as a detangler whatsoever!!! It will pull chunks out like an angry high-school girl fighting over some feels! I did remove two of the rows of bristles to allow an easier brushing experience. The handle is a little slick and hard to hold, just make sure you have all the product off of your hands before brushing. And for technique support check out YouTube! Hair goal life changer!

  I bought this brush for my daughter who has very thick and curly hair. On the 2nd use of the brush, all of the rows of bristles fell out of the brush. It is very cheaply made. The only reason I resorted to Amazon for ordering a Denman brush was because Sally's Beauty Supply was sold out. At Sally's their Denman brushes are the same price I paid for this one. Please visit your local beauty supply store and try purchasing a Denman brush from them first before resorting to this particular one. I only put 1 star for ratings because there was not an option to leave zero stars.

  I have thick, shoulder length, curly  hair that I initially detangle in the shower with the Tangle Teezer.  After I get out of the shower, I apply detangler/styling product and then distribute that though my hair and continue to detangle using the Denman brush (7 rows).  This brush works really well for these purposes.  After watching several YouTube videos, I've learned how to use the brush to form more defined curls and am quite pleased with the results.  The brush itself is very sturdy and well made and seems like it would hold up well over time.  I'd recommend the Denman brush for a gentle and effective post-shower detangling and styling, especially for curly hair.

  I own 2 other denman brushes and wanted to replace them.  None of the beauty supply stores here in Massachusetts and in New York (where I frequently travel) carry them, so I went to Amazon.  The brush is great!  The bristles are stiff rubber which works well on my hair when it is worn natural as well as when I press it for a straight look.  It is especially good for wrapping at night.Only thing, I prefer the fuller sized brush but the 7-row is especially light-weight and works great when wrapping.

  I do love this brush, it helps with static and is a dream when brushing through wet hair (bc of the rubber base) esp when I’m doing some kind of treatment and don’t want residue in my brush. However, I have 1b hair so this brush isn’t really necessary for my type of hair. I’m considering getting the 5 row to see if I like that better since the only problem is really the width of the brush. Fine haired girls will know what I mean when I say it kind of goes right through my hair to my scalp so I don’t get the best resistance when brushing. Not that I want much. Like I said, I have the 7 row so I may just try the 5 bc I do like this brush A LOT.

I have extremely thick hair, and I usually keep it pretty long, and this brush goes right through it. My 3 year old also has thick hair that tangles badly if you look at it wrong, and it gets her stubborn tangles out easily.

They last a very long time , are easy to clean the hair out of the brush and are such a great value because once you use it your hair will just glide through it when wet and conditioned and you get so man uses out of it for styling . I usually only buy it at Sally’s Beauty Supply but I didn’t feel like going to the store and hunting one down so instead I came to Amazon and ordered it here. I was a little nervous because I wanted it to be the exact same product and not a dupe & I’m happy to say it is the exact same product  !

  If you have curly hair you absolutely need this brush, it has been a godsend! I have very thick curly hair and I stumbled on this brush when searching for products to help with curly hair and I am so glad I did! It brushes through easily but helps retain all the beautiful curls while getting rid of the frizz. My hair hasn’t looked this good in forever!

    Mom's new favorite hairbrush
  
",5.0,Jeff,"Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2017","









  
  
    
  My mother has been using her same hair brush that her beautician sold her in the 1970s! It had an acrylic wood-grain handle with this same red rubber spine backing, and 9 rows of pliable black teeth (the kind without the balls on the end). Well, after decades of use, the rubber finally cracked and split enough that she has been looking for a replacement. Guess who's in charge of finding it. ""Well, Mom, they don't make those anymore, so you'll have to try one of these."" She tries them, although indignantly, and settles on two. She has medium-short, thick, wavy hair, but I really don't think that part matters as much as the fact that she's never had to try anything different for 40 years. After receiving this one and another product from Amazon (you'll probably find a similar review there), she's decided that this one is now her everyday brush. It has the weight and feel of her old one, but I doubt it is made to last another 40 years (I know my mom isn't). For all 3 of you who are still using their 1970s hairbrush, and are nervous as to where to find a close replica, she recommends this Denman brand. I recommend living a little.

  Ok so this item is definitely a fake.... the quality is too shotty to be a real denman... I decided to try it anyway and it actually helped define my curls a lot! I still think I may return and get the real denman but I would venture to say it probably works the same.... only you can buy “fake denmans” for only 1-4 dollars..... very expensive for a fake.....I would buy direct from denman.... notice the “denman store” has no phone number.... I like the results but I’m pissed about the price and it being fake I feel ripped off and now have to go out of my way to return it to kohl’s.... I think I’d rather just keep it.... hoping it doesn’t break on me....

    Only Somewhat Useful For Short Fine Wavy Hair.  But I tried it!
  
",3.0,Susan466,"Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  Watched all the videos and then twirl brushed my hair in the shower following shampoo and conditioner.  Pulled the upper layer up and went around my head twirling the lower layer.  Then did the upper.  I applied Leave in after by gently smoothing it over and then squished.  It DOES make your hair curlier.  My hair came out quite curly when it dried, more so than usual.  The first 2 times I missed spots though and that was a problem as the rest of the head was curlier.  There really is not a way to fix that.  On the third try I got the whole head curly.  I wash every 3 days.  I kept randomly twirl brushing it all over after going around once to make sure it was all involved.  My issue is that it did not overnight well.  My hair is short and I sleep with it in a Buff, which preserves the curls.  But this kind of styling was not well preserved all over.  Again I ended up with one side still curly and the other not.  Therefore I will only use it for a special occasion on the Day Of.  It looks great the first day if you need it for that evening, but it's too much trouble for every day, and it does not last in short fine wavy hair.

    Good brush for curly hair
  
",4.0,Elena Rogow,"Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2014","









  
  
    
  This is a really excellent brush.  I had bought this because so many curly-haired people were singing it's praises, and it's true - this is a great dry-detangling brush.  I use it prior to every time I wash my hair.  It's both gentle and effective; I lose far less hair than I did with my drugstore paddle brush.  However, I wouldn't advise brushing your hair when wet - I did that once when I misplaced my detangling comb, and it was a little too rough on my scalp and hair follicles.  Also, although Denman advertises this as a brush you can take apart for cleaning, the brush arrives with no instructions on how to do that, so I'll have to youtube it or something when I want to deep-clean it.  On the other hand, this is such an affordable brush I don't think it really matters.Note for other women with curls: I am caucasian with corkscrew curls (think of Shirley Temple) and hair that reaches my shoulder blades.

  Although this is a very innovative brush with the option of pairing down the rows from seven rows to any number of rows in between, it just wasn't the brush for me.  I tried seven rows but wasn't able to detangle easily, so reduced the rows to four.  It still didn't provide the results of ease in detangling.  It was too rigid for me and the handle was too short.  (There is an option for additional $'s to purchase a long handle version.)  It came down to personal preference.  I prefer a much less rigid brush.

  This brush is so versatile and effective - I can't say enough about it.  It looks like an ordinary brush with plastic teeth, but it's different somehow.  It really does coat every hair with whatever you are using - conditioner, mask, gel, or even hair color.  I use it in the shower and out.  When doing the final run through after applying gel, I brush my hair in small sections out and away from the scalp, and my hair is very fluffy, curly, and bouncy.  This is one of the best hair tools ever.

    DENMAN: WELL-MADE YET FRAGILE...
  
",4.0,Nidus Productions,"Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2017","









  
  
    
  This Denman brush is absolutely awesome for detangling multi-textured afro hair, and any hair texture less curly than that. The Denman brushes I have purchased have worked better than any others I have used for this in the past. No beat-up, bent bristles from all my hairstyling abuse. Lol. However, with this new brush I more recently received, it appears as though they've changed the plastic that the handle was made from, and it seems to be a bit more fragile than the one I had before it. They've also updated the shape of it. In my inescapable clumsiness, and with slippery products on my hands, I dropped the brush on the hard, tile floor twice within the first week and a half of using it, and it, now, has this huge crack on the back of it from hitting the floor in the same spot (see photo). I am purchasing another one, just in case that crack decides to get any bigger. It isn't moving down any further, at least, but it is widening on the top the more that I use the brush. Btw, the gold logo on the back was there when I received it, but washed right off in the shower, hence the reason for its absence in the photo.Confound it, Denman! Why did you make such a fantastic, yet fragile ""heavyweight"" product? I am purchasing another one, because I love how well the brush does its job. I will just make sure I have an unreasonably firm grip on the handle while using it to prevent this from happening again. It said ""heavyweight,"" yes, but this apparently did not mean ""unbreakable."" It can take on death-defying feats like getting the tangles out of my unruly ""wool,"" but I guess the ""heavyweight"" part would only apply to the fact that it doesn't feel like a feather in the hand.Anyway, this brush works like a dream, but treat it like porcelain. Hopefully, the designers will return to the drawing board and, next time, use a plastic material that is a little sturdier and more suited for this application.

  I bought this brush on the recommendation of a family friend whose stylist-friend recommended the brand.  I was looking for a brush to use on my 10 yr olds thick, straight hair as she wasn't doing the best job of brushing it and getting the knots out.  When the brush arrived, it looked good, had a nice weight to it and comfortable handle.  I gave it a try on my own thin, straight hair and was immediately disappointed.  This brush pulled my hair quite a bit and frankly, hurt. I didn't give any opinion to my daughter when she got home from school - just told her that her new brush arrived.  She tried it and immediately cried out and declared she wasn't going to be using it  I was not surprised.  I'm not familiar with what many reviewers describe as the ""denman of old"" so I can't speak to how this brush compares to previous models, but taken by itself, I was disappointed. I'm also surprised since many reviewers commented that it worked great on their curly/ thick hair bc again, this hurt my thin straight hair.Since this brush can't be returned, I'm stuck with it, but I'm going to buy the wet brush which was recommended by a number of moms I know (saw those recommendations after I purchased this one.

  I had this style brush for over ten years and finally replaced it with the same.  The bristles had finally starting wearing out (lots of heat from the hair dryer).  I have a lot of wave and body in my hair.  I like using this brush for straightening my hair without it being stick straight.  I love that its rubber, it seems to hold up better compared to the plastic bristle type brushes.  I also like the weight of it for handling.

  I wanted to like this brush. I tried multiple times becauseof the glowing reviews this brush received by other Naturallykinky textured ladies on youtube. I thought maybe the brush washelping to release shed hair, until I switched back to my largewide-toothed combed and experienced less hair loss. Tried again,and again, to only experience painful breaking and pulling of my hair!I have a super mixed range of hair, mostly 4b/4c, however withinthere are 3c and 4a hair textures, and well as just some spots ofloosely textured ""frizz"" with no curl near my forehead and crown.I tried removing every other row, I tried only using 3 rows, I tried 5,and the results stayed the same. Hair breakage. I tried using it in theshower with soaking wet hair and conditioner, damp hair with leave-in, butNOPE! This wasn't the brush for me.  I'll stick with my wide-toothed comband finger detangling and keep my hair. Ultimately, after 9 months of attempts,this brush found itself in the trash. And it was a really expensive brush.I do have to say it is a sturdy brush and it cleansed easily because of the removablebase and rows. However, this brush just wasn't for me.:(

    Won't fall out your oily hands... for ETHNIC HAIR 💁🏾‍♀️
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2019","









  
  
    
  I love this brush because I can apply oil to my hair and comb it without it falling out my hand! I've had so many other detangling brushes, but this one has the longest bristles, and the best grip ever. You can lather up that conditioner, use that oil, have it all over your hands and still have a firm grip on this brush. The plates are removable (but are really locked in place) so that you can clean it (watch a Youtube video on this for reference).As for detangling, it does a good job on wet hair but not the best on dry hair. You would need some water to dampened but it does detangle better than that blue detangling brush (Michel Mercier Detangler - Detangling Hairbrush for Thick Hair) on thicker curly 4-type hair. The bristles are way longer and on better angles. My hair doesn't get caught in it even if I do not pre-comb it out, but I use conditioner as my slip.I would recommend, however, this is NOT a miracle worker. If you have matted or knotted up/abandoned hair, you will still struggle with detangling using any brush. If you can not part your hair with the tail end of a comb, you need to work slowly and with LOTS of patience. But once you have the bigger kinks/knots out, this will really help you with your future washes (should you not go too long/months without washes your hair). I hope this helps and good luck :)

  I'm very familiar with the Denman brush, as I grew up using them, but this one I received is problematic. For starters, the D D pieces at the top of the brush are misaligned and have literal gaps between them and don't look like they fit together so it looks like cheap crap. Additionally, the 6th row is missing a bristle at the top. I don't mind paying $15 for a hairbrush if it is quality, but this is most definitely not.

  I bought a $20 hair brush, and I don't regret it. I use it right after I shower after adding product, and again after it's 2/3 dry as a touch up. My hair has been looking fantastic since I started this routine. (Caucasian hair, chin length when dry, moderate curl [2?] ). I could have gotten one of the knock offs since my hair isn't too demanding, but I opted for the name brand anyways and I really like it.The keys is that the spokes are linear. They are lined up in such away that it's like passing your hair through a series of parallel combs. It orders all the the hairs, reduces frizz, and helps curls clump more readily.

  Re-purchased this brush after the rubber on my former Denman fell apart after many years of use.Pro's of this brush:-  Good for removing loose hair.  Some brushes I have tried to use don't collect loose hair adequately, so  end up with loose hair on my clothes, which looks sloppy, especially on dark colored clothes or work clothes.-  Easy to clean.  Some brushes I have used are difficult to remove hair from - with the Denman it's easy.-  Doesn't pull my hair.  I am able to use this even on my wet hair after showering before blow drying it. Don't know if it matters but I have naturally straight hair so that's what I am using this brush on.Con's:None

  I’m not exactly sure if this brush is real or not but there are many signs leading towards it being fake, or if it is real... Denman’s stepped down quite a few notches on the quality. The pic on the left is one that I’ve had for at least 10 years and has lasted me that long up until it broke a couple of weeks ago. Bought the one on the right and only after a few uses, the bristles are already looking as if it’s just as old. Additionally, the crowns above the “D’s” are not located in the same place as my older brush 🤔.  The quality is horrible (see pic). Really not happy with this but I’ve already used it so it’s no sending back.

  I bought this Denman brush because curlies kept speaking so wondwrfully of these brushes, but this specific denman brush is of horrible quality for my hair type. Too fragile. The thing keeps falling apart each time I try to detangle my hair, and instead of detangling my hair it tangles it!! Might be ideal for thinner, not-so-curly hairlies. Perhaps for girls with wavier hair rather than 3a and above. 3b girls, don't waste your money with this specific brush.

  This brush has been with me for my whole big chop and I love her, I’ve had all 7 rows of teeth for the whole awkward length stage and I’m finally down to 4 and it’s been amazing so far. My curls are so defined and it all thanks to this brush. It was very easy to use as a detangler when my hair was shorter, but now that it’s gotten longer it takes longer to do with the brush so I use my fingers and finish off with the brush. However, it’s kinda slippery to hold onto when my hands are covered with product so there has been some slips and tugs but nothing I can’t handle. At first it was really hard to pull out the rubber part but after i had a couple times it got easier to slide in and out, I think mine had just been cut weird or something.

  I love that the bristles don't have little balls on the end that get stuck on knots. We are still learning about the right way to care for my daughter's hair. This brush definitely helps. I figured out that if I hold it so the brush is pointing up instead of down or right at her scalp (so that just one edge of the brush is touching her hair, and it is basically upside down), then I can finally brush her hair without any risk of snagging knots. It takes time, and lots of conditioner, but I wouldn't be able to do this with any of our other brushes.

  Completely satisfied. Didn't even realize I was ordering the 'heavy weight' model, but I'm so glad I did because that was the exact reason I was ordering another denman; because the handle on my previous one had broken off. Although this model is a little heavier than the regular 9-row denman it is well worth it if you have really thick, curly, Afro textured hair. I often use my denman on wet hair which clumps my curls together, putting significant more strain on the brush. This brush is holding up well. Highly recommend.

  When I starting detangling my hair for wash day using my leave-in for the first time with this brush, my immediate thought was: “This is incredible.” The Denman brush is absolutely fantastic for curly hair. I experienced no painful tugging. Just an easy, super nice feeling of the brush gliding through my hair while getting the detangling job done. Additionally, this brush really accented my curls than with a wide tooth comb. Definitely use when your hair is wet or damp and use a leave-in or defining cream for an even spread through your locks. If you have lots of hair, section your hair too for an easier time. I use this brush all the time now; for wash days, reset days, and refresh after wash days.I have multi-textured hair ranging from 2b-3c curls, high porosity and high density. I found the Denman 7-row brush to be the best detangler for my hair.

  We have been using it to comb through my daughter's fine, curly hair after washing and detangling with a Wet Brush.  I divide her hair into vertical sections (like they do on youtube) and brush with the Denman, then let air dry, and it does leave her curls more defined and springy.I've used it to detangle here and there on wet hair but would not use it for that primarily. The pink and purple combo reminds me of the 1980s in a good way and is very cheerful. We are happy with it.  Also happy it was made in the UK.

  This is specifically a styling brush. If you are holding it horizontally to detangle you are wrong. Hold the brush vertically to detangle, or use a brush designed for detangling. Use the brush horizontally to define your curls and/or clump your curls. Definition works best if you work in small, relatively thin sections or “panels” of hair. ManesbyMel  is a good resource on YouTube for how to use the denman brush for styling/curl definition.If you hate this brush, one of the following is probably likely:1. You are using it wrong2. You are trying to get hair that won’t curl to curl (damaged or not curly to begin with)3. Your hair is too weak to withstand the brushing so it is breaking offNone of these are faults with the brush itself. There is a little bit of a learning curve and the brush may not be the best option for everyone but it is a good product for what it is designed to do!

  If you have curly hair, this brush is MUST have! I use it in the shower when detangling my hair and it leaves my hair super soft and easy to manage. I have 3c/4a curls. The only issue I have and this might be because of the thickness of my hair, the brush slides apart a bit.

    Great brush, works as stated
  
",5.0,Dria,"Reviewed in the United States September 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  This brush works exactly as described. I used the brush to detangle a 12-inch curly human hair wig. I completely wet the wig with a spray bottle of water, and brushed through the tangles starting at the bottom, then working through the top. I was able to brush through the hair without the brush snagging or any bristles breaking.  I flipped/ twirled the brush throughout the hair to create curls. The wig looked great after it dried. I didn't use any curling product on the wig because I wanted to test the brush without it. Using a lightweight moisturizing curling product would probably help the brush create an even better curl pattern. I was skeptical about the brush after reading through the Amazon reviews, but did further online research, and read more positive reviews. I'm glad I purchased this brush. The key is to completely wet the hair. If you use this on African  American natural hair, I definitely recommend using a good moisturizering conditioner, and section your hair before carefully detangling, then brushing through each section and creating your curls. I don't know my curl pattern to list it, and suffer with alopecia, but, my hair is a tight curl, dry, and fragile. The brush worked on my natural African American hair too. The brush is easy to use, sturdy, and it really detangles and curls hair. Ordering was seamless, and the shipping was fast.

  I expected the brush to be much smaller.  It was advertised as having a longer handle so that is why I bought this one  with 5 rows over the 7 rows because I thought it would be easier to control with a longer handle... but overall it is a very petite brush so the handle is actually not long overall.  Hard to explain but hope that makes sense.  I am still using it for curl definition... learning the technique and getting some success, but wishing I had bought the one with 7 rows as I think it would give me more control overall.

When I start brushing I have to stop myself because it feels so nice.  This type of brush also works well on my niece's naturally curly hair.  It's a great detangler and gives defintion to her curls.  It doesn't snag or pull out large amounts of hair.  It's strong and won't break on you.

  I just started the CGM, and saw that many youtubers raved about using a denman brush. Let me tell yo0u, this is actually magic. I was skeptical of whether or not its authentic based on other reviews, but it seems to be authentic (i've never had one before). This 9 row brush has made my curls more curly and defined with results lasting six or seven days until I wash again. It definitely controls frizz too. I have long curly thick hair and this works perfectly, but if you have thin hair it might not be so great, as it does slightly tug on the hair when brushing it wet. I've been working on how to gently pull with it, but it is a sturdy brush (which i like!). The rows are removable, by pulling the back up then out and pulling the bristles out--but it is a very well made brush so pull hard on it to adjust the rows. I love this!!!!

  I have fine hair and my style is a disconnected undercut.

I thought maybe it would just be against my preference since this brush has so many high reviews. I gave the brush to my mother she doesn't like the feel of it either. She said the bristles feels as if they were scratching and leaving marks on her scalp. The comb is fine it self for separated strands and what not, but the overall feel of the brush just feels off. Feels like the comb is too rubber. I will have to go back to using those brushes with thinner bristles and with the small balls at the end of the points.

  ...or the quality has gone down greatly.I have several REAL Denman's that I've had for years, but wanted a second D3 to keep at the gym. Ordered this one and immediately felt something was off. I've shaved my head bald and the hair is just now growing back (about an inch long) and this NEW 'Denman' can barely get through it. Whereas my old/original Denman (same type, D3) was a beast in getting through my hair even when my 3c/4a curls were down to my shoulders. This new one is bendy and feels cheaply made. But since I can't prove it's a fake, I'll just have to suck up the loss of the money as this is going in the trash, and in the future I'll stick to buying from the place I bought from before.

  So when I received the brush there was no marking of an authentic made Denman brush and instead has a gold sticker with Chinese lettering on it. I then noticed the red plastic with the bristles that you are meant to be able to pull out in a real Denman brush is glued shut into the brush, as well as the bristles and quality just really not being the same. I bought a Denman brush directly from their site and could immediately tell the difference in quality and production. Trust me y'all, much better to get it directly from the site when you know its authentic. You won't be wasting your time or money

The Denman brush is totally worth the hype. I don't like hair typing but I have 4C curls. I mention this only because others with similar hair types have said this brush pulled their hair out. I used mine strictly in the shower while deep conditioning/detangling. When I tell you this brush glided through my hair, I can honestly say I mean it. I think it works best on 4C with tons of product or on wet slippery hair. It also made my curls pop! I am only disappointed that I did not trust my instincts enough to buy one sooner.

It would be almost impossible to get my curls defined without getting back in the shower. With this brush, now all I have to do it spray my hair with water, put product in it, and comb it through with this brush, and my curls are poppin'! My image shows before and after use of the brush about 30 minutes after getting out of the shower. The brush is also very sturdy and you can take rows out if you want a looser curl!

  I have modified the brush to have every other row and it's perfect. I shed very little hair using this brush. I also purchased the mini version for my baby girl and with the same modification works well for her. Great for detangling and smoothing hair without undue stress on your hair.

    The Best brush ever!!!

  Denman brushes are the best brushes ever made. The classic is the best. I've used them from the late 90s, and that one I used until I got my new one about a year ago. So cheap it is not. It does not fall apart. I had long (to my butt) curly hair for years and it never let me down. They must be buying some cheaper one to save many, cause they are wrong about the Denman. Best brush and only brush for most of my life.

  Bought this for my daughter to detangle hair when wet. It did not work. The bristles move too much which makes it ineffective for detangling.

  I love my denman brush. I have been using it for years and still going strong. I prefer to use this brush to detangle my 3c/4A textured hair than a wide tooth comb. It is also easy to use and hold

  I haven't used a brush on my curly hair since I was a teenager, for anything other than blowing my hair straight. But, when I saw YouTube videos of women with my type of hair using this brush to style their natural curls, I had to try it. I like it, it works great for separating your curls. Hair looks almost as good as when you finger curl it and can be done so much faster,

  I began my curly girl journey at the beginning of COVID-19.  I have tried a multitude of products as my hair is more wavy than curly. I was getting frustrated bc I have witnessed some curls but lately even my waves our flat. I have used this brush one time and I have some full curls and the best waves I have ever achieved! I also used less product and a lot less effort at trying to scrunch to create more waves! This is a must for anyone on a curly girl journey-if you actually have more curl instead of waves I can't imagine what this would do for you with a lot less effort!

    GREAT BRUSH FOR BLACK NATURAL HAIR!!
  
",5.0,Yeshua's Beloved,"Reviewed in the United States February 27, 2016","









  
  
    
  This brush is fantastic!!! It works wonders on my natural hair. I am a African American woman and I have 4a/4b/4c natural hair. Yes, I have a combination of all three curl types. This brush makes detangling my hair effortless and it reduces the amount of hair that ends up in my brush, once I'm done styling my hair. I used to use a regular paddle brush from just a simple drug store brand and it was always full of my luscious locks everytime I used it. I watched this video by Whitney White, aka Naptural85 on Youtube: [...] At the end of the video, she shows how to properly ""modify"" a denman brush for curly natural hair. Her video inspired me to buy a Denman Brush and give it a try and I love it. I find so much less of my hair in my brush and on my bathroom floor!! Praise Jesus for this hair brush, now I can detangle my hair thoroughly, quickly and gently! I love this brush and would recommend it to all black women!

  If you purchased this brush to de-tangle your hair, unless you have short to medium, STRAIGHT and fairly FINE hair, you are going to be drastically disappointed!  Try taking out a few rows of pins and it might work ok as a de-tangle brush.  OR, better yet, skip this one and get yourself a proper paddle brush (or wide tooth comb) that is specifically meant to tackle wet tangled hair.  Enough said about that, onward to my review why I purchased this brush.I have 2B-3A curly, dry-ish hair that always could use a boost of product and styling methods to make it curlier and to have the style last.  This brush is perfect to STYLE your wet curly hair (once it has been de-tangled).  I would say I have fine to medium density hair (but tons of it) and use a light leave-in AND then a styling cream (some use a hybrid creamy gel if it has some slip)  to style my hair with this brush.  You need some SLIP or it is not going to work.  What the brush does is distribute your product (styling cream) evenly, helps to separate the strands, and because of the half round shape, can put a nice bend to your hair.  All of that helps your hair clump and curl much better than using your fingers alone.  Think of it a bit like finger coiling without all the time and effort.Depending on your curl type, you can get anywhere from nice loose waves to tight ringlets.  I suggest checking out YouTube for some pointers on the different methods of use for this brush.  Also, ""seal"" your styling with a gel; it will help hold it for a few days.My last ""tips"" are what brush to purchase.  I have layered hair and my shortest hair (on the top of my head) is about 3 inches long up to bra strap length hair and the D3 works best for me on my longer hair.  I feel that the D3 is a bit big for my shortest length hair and I have been experimenting with the D33 and D14 .  So far, I think the top of my head is too short to get much benefit from any Denman brush so I do a combination of finger coiling and twisting the D33.  Unfortunately that is also my ""straightest"" hair and hoping with time and the Denman I can train it to curl a bit better.If you have very long hair, you may prefer the D4 as there is a bit more surface area to make your styling go a bit faster.  I have seen styling of the D3 vs the D4 and the end results are not that noticeably different.  The D5 is similar  but a heavier brush but I have never used it to know of any difference in styling your curly hair.And finally the D14 and D33 are best for shorter hair.  I find they work ok on layered hair, but I would suspect either would be absolutely perfect for a single layer bob.One final note if you have very thick hair.  You may wish to remove a row or two of the pins or else you might never be able to get the brush through your hair, no matter how much of a slippy cream you apply.  You could also try the D41, or Free Flow.  They come with less pins to start.Hope this exceptionally long post has been helpful.  Good luck on your curly girl journey!
