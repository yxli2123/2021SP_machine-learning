  I own an electric guitar and tried to learn how to play it, I thought it was okay to learn first. But, I learned from a friend at work that acoustic is/can be better for beginners. I don't make much money so I bought this one, cheap and quick to learn more. It works like any guitar would. I have found that when it was brand new, every day I picked it up to play it, the string were out of tune after I just tuned them the night before. It seems that they just aren't tight and need to be tightened a lot, they are new strings. After retuning it for 2 weeks everyday, it doesn't seem to come untuned again. Still, pretty good bang for your buck.

  Just as it has stated, I got all. Got 4 stars because each time you want to play, you have to tune it. All instruments have to be tuned. My pitch pipe is malfunction but  can tune the guitar using app on smartphone.

    Beautiful Starter Guitar!
  
",5.0,Alicia Moulton,"Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  I love my guitar! üòä I bought this guitar a year ago after deciding on a whim that I wanted to learn guitar but not wanting to spend too much money. I was looking for a good starter guitar and this was exactly what I was hoping to find! While you can tell looking closely that this beautiful guitar is cheaply made (for example, the rosette and sound boards are both stickers rather than being built into the guitar. They don't fall or peel off so I don't mind that, but that's one specific difference in quality compared to more expensive guitars), it is good quality for the price, has good sound, and still looks like a serious guitar. (It is a bit smaller than the standard size.) As some others have mentioned, it falls out of tune very quickly, but that felt easy enough to me to resolve with the tuner (included), pitch pipe (included), or by tuning it to a guitar tuning video on YouTube. This also comes with an extra set of strings, 2 different-style sound boards (you choose which to install/put on), a pick holder that you can attach to the guitar (I love this!), a set of picks, a strap, and a case. The case is not padded at all, so be careful, but I've still been able to use it to transport my guitar and am really happy that this guitar came with it because I wouldn't have wanted to spend money on a separate guitar case at this point. The case opens at the bottom and has an adjustable strap and pocket. I haven't used the separate guitar strap because there wasn't something to attach it to the guitar on both sides, but I could have figured this out if I had tried harder. I think there might have been instructions in the other reviews.Oh also, another perk of this guitar is the strings and fingerboard are very comfortable--at least for me. I tried playing a friend's guitar after playing this one, and the strings were spaced a little bit higher above the finger board than this one, meaning it required me to press on the chords harder to play. Playing this guitar was much more comfortable to me by comparison.If you are an intermediate guitar player or more serious than I was about your long-term commitment to guitar, you might want to get a more expensive guitar set.But for someone like me who wants something beautiful and functional but cheap, I leave this with a very definite 5-star review! I am thoroughly satisfied with this guitar set! I love that it is a complete set with everything I needed to get started and an excellent value for the price. I may upgrade someday, or I may be happy with this for my whole life as an amateur guitar player. I highly recommend this guitar. ü§©

  The guitar looks very nice and my son has been really enjoying learning to play it. I downloaded an app that is teaching him how to play songs. I am very happy that he is developing a new hobby. This guitar is great for beginners. It comes with a tuner, but I've found that the app I'm paying for tunes it easier. It also comes with a carrying case and pick. Great value for the money!

    Does _not_ fit electric guitars/bass well
  
",5.0,Gabe Robinson,"Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  As other reviewers have said this stand is very sturdy and packs up very well. Fits my acoustic guitar reasonably well. Padding and feet are well crafted and functional.However, this doesn't fit my Strat or P-bass at all. the slight asymmetry of the bodies won't line up well with the cradle arms. If you align the body in the arms, they lean to the side. You can adjust the width of the arms but the top pad is anchored to one of the arms, so that becomes oddly aligned with the legs at anything other than as wide as it goes. The cradle arms are welded to the frame which (I think) is the design flaw. If they were free to rotate, they could be adjusted to hold the instrument upright with one arm wider/narrower than the other to accommodate slightly asymmetric bodies. Note... I have a Strat and Fender P-bass. These aren't exactly Gibson Explorer profiles.Does fit my acoustic, so I'll use it for that .

  I paid around $55 for this beginners guitar.  I'm into my 2nd year of playing and wanted a travel guitar to take around with me and not be concerned if it got dinged up a bit while traveling. This was way better than I expected and cheaper than those practice fretboards that you see around.It was well packaged and came with the following... - a dust cover - extra pack of strings (it was already strung but not tuned) - a pack of 9 guitar picks - a pick holder with adhesive backing to stick it onto your guitar (or strap I guess) - a pitch pipe - an electric tuner that attaches to your guitar - a guitar strap - an adhesive backed plastic plate  for the front body where you would normally get scratches from strumming (I don't know what it's called) - knobs for the strap already installed on the body and base of the neckI was able to tune it out of the box (although I'll give it a few days to acclimate to the temperature and humidity of our place) and it holds it quiet well.  I purchased the coffee finish which actually is lighter than the photograph (it's more of a cognac color) but is still nice to me.All in all this was an excellent purchase for me. I actually wonder if they just had a warehouse full that they needed to get rid of and threw everything but the kitchen sink in just to clear it out! (I don't think so though because nothing was dusty!)For what I got with it, the instrument quality and the price point I give this one 5 stars.

  ¬†In the beginning the guitar isn't so bad. It didn't play amazing but it's cheap so I wasn't expecting much anyway. But it did not last. The neck cracked I don't know if just mine was defective. It's very hard to play. Not worth it just buy an 100 dollar guitar. You can't learn how to play guitar on a cheap instrument. It will just frustrate u that u can't sound good and In reality it is the guitar. The tuning doesn't hold anymore I have to tune it after every song.  The paint just keeps on chipping. And it looks horrible. I'm giving it 2 stars cuz it was only 45 dollars. What guitar do u think  ur gonna get for that price anyway? It has a really warm sound and it could be a good guitar just very hard to play cuz it's made so cheap.Ps.the video that I posted doesn't sound so good because the guitar can't stay in tune anymore

If you really want this guitar, but a good set of nylon strings. Steel strings will not stay in tune. The body isn't reinforced enough to handle the tension. On the other hand, if you have nylon strings it sounds great and is beautiful.

  First time playing guitar ever was a perfect purchase for me -- it comes with everything you need to get started, minus perhaps a stand.The ring around the hole is a sticker and the pick guard is also stick on, but playing it for an hour everyday for over a month has not caused it to come off or have any trouble.The only thing its really missing is the fret markers, so I used some masking tape on the side to mark the frets. Its not the greatest guitar ever but for $40 its absolutely amazing.

  Its better than a 2 star rating, but not quite at a 3. I bought this over a year ago as my first guitar to learn on. Something nice and cheap just to start out on. And it does exactly that! Each time I pick it up I do have to retune it as it won't hold a note for more than a day at a time. I also had to file down some of the frets myself as the strings would rub when they shouldn't. Overall I think this is a good guitar for the price, and great for beginners. The sound is pretty decent. I figured I'd finally write a review for this as I'm getting my second guitar, now that I've learned how to play somewhat decent. If you're looking for the best bang for your buck in a guitar and have the extra money, check out the Ibanez AW 54 OPN!

  Okay i know it is very cheap for a guitar but its basically trash. It was missing a knob to hold the strap, the tunner fell apart as it was being taken out of the box, the guitar wouldn't even tune. I saw other bad reviews that it was cheaply made but my little sister is a beginner and i thought that it would be perfect but she cant learn on a guitar that cant be tuned. Just a waste of money.

  I bought this guitar as a beginner and at first, you think it's a really good value because it looks good, has a ton of stuff in the box like a tuner and picks.but as you peel back the layers you find out it's not what it seems to be...first, the 1,2,3 strings are weak and broken (out of the box), and while the box did come with replacement strings as a guitar 'for beginners' who is going to replace there own strings, on top of that the ones included are roughly the same quality as the broken ones and I bet won't last.secondly, most guitars have dots along the frets (the metal bars) to help beginners to learn the different frets and get more used to hand placement, this guitar has them but very faded/the same color as the body and almost non-exsistantthird. the included tuner is terrible and not accurate so I had to use a third-party app to tune and one would think a beginner guitar would be already tuned because beginners don't know how to tune but out of the box it is far from itover all don't recommend

    Cannot Keep This Flimsey Balsa Stick in Tune

  What a disappointment.  I know that $55 shouldn‚Äôt buy much, but I think a $10 kids toy would stay in tune better than this junk.  If you tune one string, by the time you get to the others, they will all be out of tune.  In addition, the way the strings are positioned above the frets so high, it will be a severe challenge for anyone to hold a chord/note.

  I bought this guitar about a month ago to learn to play. For a beginner it's great to learn how to play on. The tuner works great and it's comfortable to hold and sit with. I'm short and have small fingers so he size is perfect for me. I do notice that when I am playing and I am strumming a bit too hard the strings make a humming sound (yes they're in tune I always check before beginning to play and make sure my fingers have correct placement as well) but if I strum just a bit softer the buzzing goes away. That's really the only negative thing I have to say about it. Other than that it's a pretty good guitar to learn with, for the price it is.

Replacing the strings with quality ones we've used on other guitars, after repeated stretching and tuneing, we discovered something wonky in the raised fret bars that cause vibration and note distortion. This thing's junk. Don't waste your time or money...or blood. Unless you want a derpy looking wall decoration, because that's all it's good for.

  This guitar is beginner-friendly in that you don't invest a lot, but you do have to know how to tune it. Tuning mobiles apps are available and accurate, so I will recommend using an app and instead of the tuner that is included in the pack.This review is written 3.5 months after I brought the guitar, since which I've been playing for half an hour almost every day. It's great in combination of a YouTube course to help you navigate the learning curve.

  When you buy this product, you are not just buying the guitar itself. You are buying the digital tuner, extra strings, travel case, guitar picks, etc. This is basically the perfect kit for anyone with zero experience with a guitar because you don't have to worry about going out and buying these individual items.Some people are hard about the sound that the guitar makes, but to me it's very beautiful.The biggest pro about this item is that it ships in a way that protects the guitar during shipping. The guitar is packaged in a box inside a bigger box to protect it.

    Great for open chords. Not great for barre chords.

  This is great overall, however, when I tried fretting some barre chords no matter how many adjustments I made to my fingers the sound wasn't very clean.

  Comes with a bunch of crap that you don't need. The design is a nylon string guitar, yet the manufacturer put steel strings on it (which will damage the instrument). Once you get proper strings on it, it sounds okay, but if you're looking for an actual beginner guitar, pay a little more for a better instrument. Your experience will be much more positive if you do.

  This guitar is even more beautiful in person! I haven beber played guitar before, so I will be a big time beginner but my nephew plays and when I showed him it turns out he has the same one and he said it‚Äôs a good guitar. I can‚Äôt believe the price! Definitely a good purchase!

    So far so Good

  It is a begginers guitar, nothing fancy, the strings are ok, you might want to get new ones (do remember that new strings are always going to need tuning every time you are going to play, that is not a guitar's fault, it's basically the strings adjusting themselves to the tension).Let's be honest, it is a cheap guitar, when you hold it it does fell cheap, like it's going to break at any time. I've been using it for almost a week, and I'm concerned it's going to break, and eleven though was cheap (money wise) it still money invested and I dont want it to break.Sound (with the strings that comes with it) it's ok I do advice getting new ones.It does have a paint smell, specially the cover, but after a day or two it comes off. (The cover might need more time)The picks are nice, different thicknessThe tuner it's good (even though I don't know how to use properly, which is my fault)
