    Water comes right through this tent
  
",1.0,Kieran Scanlon,"Reviewed in the United States May 1, 2017","









  
  
    
  I set this tent up in conditions that ranged from misty to steady rain that lasted 12 hours. As soon as I set it up, I noticed that the rain was coming directly through the walls. I put the fly (sold separately) on and that helped stop rain from coming through the top, but the wall leaks persisted.We had four of the EXACT same Coleman 6-person instant tents set up and mine was the only one that leaked. I assume the factory missed the waterproofing step.MAKE SURE YOU TEST THE TENT BEFORE YOU DRIVE FIVE HOURS FROM HOME TO USE IT.

  Tent seems durable and was set up in seconds. I set the tent up in the back yard to make sure everything worked, it started to rain and almost instantly I noticed the seams of the tent were leaking water. I’m am really disappointed as this tent is supposedly rated high for being water proof. The more frustrating part was I had to speak to 4 different Amazon representatives to coordinate an exchange, they were finally able to accommodate me and get a new tent sent. We will see in a few days if the new tent is also defective. Coleman is usually a quality brand and this product had really high rating but I am very disappointed thus far.

  Huge and ridiculous -- obviously not for backpacking -- but my husband and I love it. We throw a queen air mattress in here when car camping and we feel like Kings. It's so easy to set up and take down; set-up is doable with just one person (possibly of a certain height, we are 5'8""+), take down is easiest with two to help stuff it back in the carrying case.We had it set up in the midwest when a tornado-y thunderstorm rolled through; we sought higher ground till it passed, when we returned, she was safe and sound and still in the ground. Not completely waterproof, but we only got a bit of dew/sweat on the interior walls, and nothing on the floor.The only ""con"" I have to note: I wish there were windows on all sides, so when you are inside you can enjoy the view from all angles.

    Comfy car camping cabin

  It's comfortable for a full size plus a twin sized air mattress.  It sets up and takes down very easily - sets up in less than two minutes with one person, and less than five minutes to get it stuffed into the carrying bag.  It fits in my subcompact car.  It stayed dry through 5 straight hours of heavy rain.  Too heavy to hike any real distance with, but excellent for car camping with kids.

    Being a cabin style tent it does have good stand room in the center
  
",2.0,Deadstick,"Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2017","









  
  
    
  I have a standard 4 person Coleman dome tent. I purchased this tent because I take many camping trips alone and my other tent can be a bit of a pain to put up by myself. Had it out this last weekend to give it a try. As advertised it was very quick to set up. Took a little more then 60 seconds just because I had never set it up before. Being a cabin style tent it does have good stand room in the center. I stand 6' 1"". There are some thing s about this tent I will have to get use to. The door, unlike my other tent, is not centered. It is off to the right. My wife went with me and this caused a little stumbling over each other trying to get out. The door has two zippers which were a little difficult to get open in the dark, early in the morning. IT has two windows up front, two large windows on the sides but, no window in the back. With only one little vent in the top ventilation was questionable. The window flaps could be rolled but they could not be tie and secured out of the way. Over all a nice tent.Took it for the first time on my own. Again was easy to set up. This trip it did rain. Rain fly is useless. Unless you have the windows zipped all the way up, you are going to get wet. Then windows up, no ventilation. Got hot inside real fast. Door is a real pain at night in the dark to get in and out of. Don't be in a hurry.

    Disappointed

  Disappointing. I've been an avid supporter of Coleman products for many years due to the affordability and quality of their products. I've owned a 4-person dome tent for nearly 15 years that has never leaked, never blown over, never given me trouble. Me and my wife just got a little older and decided we needed something we could stand up in and use a cot in. So we bought this. The design engineer missed the boat on this and so did quality control. I've tried different methods to try to get the tent to be taut and tight on all four slopes, but I just can't do it. It needs at least one more connection to the corner support poles on each corner because it bags and sags three quarters of the way up the corner. This causes a sag on the interior that reduces space and helps worsen the leaking. It has a loop for a stake midway between the corners in the front and back but not on the sides. It needs one because you can't keep the floor taut without them.Leaking, Leaking and more leaking. Amazing that this didn't come with a rain fly. No, not amazing, ridiculous. Where didn't it leak? This was not a hurricane - just some simple showers. It leaked at every corner floor joint. Every window leaked even when zippered completely shut. The door leaked. Who designed the door zipper? Fire that person. The zipper on my dome tent is perfect - why did someone think that needed to be changed? The windows all leaked along the bottom seam. Why? Because the side slopes can't be made taut, it rains down, water runs down the sides and collects at the bottom of the window. It has no place to go but in the tent - it's as if someone designed it that way!! The only way to prevent that leakage is to install a second shelter - or tarp - over the tent with sides, back and front that extend beyond the bottom of the window. I looked at the rain fly you can buy for this tent, and I don't think it does that. The leaking seam at the corners and where the floor connects just seems to be poor quality workmanship. I gave it a second and third coat of seam sealer and it did reduce the amount of leaking, but didn't eliminate it. I brought the tent home, set it up and let it dry out real good, then gave it a fourth really heavy dose of seam sealer at all seams. We'll see if that helps. I also designed my own rain tarp out of an old shelter frame I had that I will put over the tent next time. That's ridiculous to have to put up a shelter to put my tent under. Ridiculous. Why am I even giving this a three???? I guess because I can stand up in it, it goes up quickly, and it fits my queen-size cot with room to spare.Update:I've decided to get a new tent. Not a Coleman. The engineering and quality of this tent was just horrible. I've coated the tent inside and out with at least 4 applications of silicone spray and several coats of seam sealer on all seams. I even caulked the floor to wall seam with clear silicone caulk. I noticed in the pictures that there are 5 pole to tent clips on each corner. Mine only had 4, so I added tarp clips on the corners where it was sagging. The walls sagged so I added tarp clips on the sides to tighten the walls and floor. See pictures. I bought the rain fly. It rained tonight and the interior is soaked. Water leaked right through the walls and especially at the base of the windows. I'm leaving next Sunday for a week camping in the UP of Michigan. I hope my new tent gets here in time. Really, I recommend you do not by this tent!

  So we were a little hesitant on making this purchase after reading the 3 star and below reviews.  However, some close friends and camping partner family own this tent.  Here is what we did:Step 1-  Order the tentStep 2- Order TENT SEAM SEALERStep 3- Order Rain Fly (no brainer people)Step 4-  When tent arrives excitedly open box, and set up in the living room (optional, and be sure to check with your spouse first as this did not go over well with mine)Step 5- Take down tent from living room and set up again outside....Use the seam sealer around ALL seams inside and outside the tent liberally (or follow directions on sealant product)Step 6- Put rainfly on tentStep 7- Connect garden hose and prepare leaf blower for weather simulation testing.Step 8- After waiting desired time for sealant to set, simulate various types of rain storms from gentle drizzle to driving hurricane force rain (do this at your own risk and be sure to roll up windows  on your spouses car when aiming simulated rain in that direction)Step 9- Now using your leaf blower blast your tent with simulated wind levels from gentle meadow breezes to Hurricane Level 4 winds if you have a 4 speed leaf combo snow blower (again, do this at your own risk)Step 10-  Stake down your tent THEN redo step 9, then apologize to your spouse for crushing her flowers.During all the simulated test I found that the tent is NOT made for 50+ psi garden house spray down at full forces.... However, there was minimal leaking, and I think that was from spraying right at the zipper.  When using in a true rain fashion there was no leaking after a 10 minute soaking.  The blower was a little over the top, but even after rolling my unstaked tent into my wifes flowers the tent took all I threw at it.  I was going to repeat all the test and make a video to attach with this review but was advised (told) by my wife that I wasn't going to do that....Argh!Thanks Coleman for a great tent!  Set it up in less than 30 seconds and take down was just as simple, and I had a blast with my homemade weather simulation testing.

  This tent is fantastic for camping solo or with one other person.  Super easy to put up and take down.  Remember all those times you got home and decided you didn't want to set your tent back up and dry it out, only to regret that decision next time you went to use the tent?  That is not an issue with this tent as its so easy to pop up, you won't mind letting it dry out.I'm giving 4/5 stars because this tent leaks water when there is a heavy rain.  Nothing I can't deal with, but the seams at the top and sides allow water to come in.  Being totally honest I did not waterproof the tent so had I done that, it may have solved the issue.

   When I bought this dark room tent, there were no reviews on it, only reviews on other Coleman tents. So, while we haven’t camped in it yet, we did throw it up in the front yard to make sure everything was in good shape. I wanted to put this review out there for anyone who is as curious as I was.Straight off, I’ll address the main concern I had, and that was the amount of light the tent lets in. It’s hard to describe, but it definitely blocks A LOT of light. It’s difficult to see inside the tent with everything zipped up, even in the middle of the day (although we did not do it in direct sunlight). It’s as dark as my baby’s room during the day, and he has two layers of blackout curtains over his window. I’ll share pictures, but they really don’t do it justice. It’s very dark. I approve!The downside of that is the tent is probably going to be warm during the day. It is sprayed with a coating to give it the dark room effect (no bad smell, BTW), and that also acts as insulation. That will be great during cold nights, but maybe not great for baby’s nap time in 90 degree heat. We bought a battery operated fan to push some air through one of the screens without having to have everything opened up during our son’s naps (if he naps at all—we’ll see).One thing I don’t love about the tent is that the zipper on the curved hinged door is a pain to open and close (although the door itself is super cool). The flaps that I suppose are there to keep rain out are sewn in in different directions and it snags on those. Plus the zipper was a tad sticky. I hope beeswax will fix the problem. It wasn’t bad enough to make me not love the tent, though. It is still worth every penny!Looks cool too!The tent is huge and we can comfortably stand up inside. It was very easy to set up. We didn’t even have to look at instructions. One downside to this type of pop up tent is that it’s heavier than a traditional pole tent. Worth it for sure, though.Another thing some people will love, but I don’t, is that there are entrances on both ends of the tent. Because we have three young kids, we want to be between them and the door. We’re planning to put a small padlock on the zipper of the back entrance, that way nobody will easily get in or out on that side.We thought found this exact same tent at Costco for $20 more than Amazon. We actually bought it because we weren’t sure if the Amazon one would come in time. When it did come, we compared the two. There was an obvious size difference (Amazon one was in a much larger box), but the tent dimensions were the same. It was a puzzle to us until we opened it up and figured out that the larger one (this Amazon one) is an instant pop up tent and the smaller one from Costco is a quick set up tent, but is not an instant pop up tent. Mystery solved.That’s really all I can report on so far because we haven’t camped in it yet. But since there were no reviews on it, I wanted to get this up here with some pictures. I’ll update this review after our camping trip coming up!If this review was helpful, please hit the “helpful” button so other people can find it too!

  I cannot recommend this 4 person cabin more. Its not to be used backpacking only out of vehicle camping. My gf and I set this up in no time. Make sure to purchase the rain fly and tent kit for the mallet and upgraded steaks. Held up to a thunderstorm all weekend in grand canyon the very first time we used it. Fit a queen bed with about 2.5 feet of free space left on the entrance door side. I even put big coals in my solo stove and and the tent was 70+ while it was around 30 outside at night. Ventilation was great even in the rain with the fly.  highly recommended for expedition vehicles i will surely have this for years.

  Leaks like a sieve!  I have had several of the instant tents from Coleman, two of the larger sizes and one other in this size.They were all superior. they never leaked one drop of rain and they were very wind resistant.  the first thing I noted after I set this up on a chilly autumn day, was how drafty and cold it was compared to my other tent (the same tent) just a few feet away.  Then it rained!  while one tent remained warm and dry, this new tent was cold and soaking wet. standing water on the inside. The walls covered in water drops in their entirety.  I cannot return this tent because I bought it in 2016 and had it in storage until  my original one wore out.  It was the fall of 2018 when I set it up the first time.  I will reorder a new one because I love this tent.  But I imagine I will have a 50/50 shot at a weather proofed product.  Other reviews are saying the same thing.Shame on you Coleman for selling faulty tents.  And for saying that they have a special weather tec design, your faithful customers are getting soaked in the tent and in the pocket book!

  I purchased the 10 man green and teal version and couldn’t WAIT to set it up for my first night!! After making sure all of the poles were extended and locked in position, I staked it down as instructed. Definitely a two man/woman job.  Immediately, the entire side caved in.  I tried closing all of the windows and that helped... for a brief second, but collapsed again.  No point in buying this tent unless you live where is there is no breeze.  Wind was around 20 mph which shouldn’t have brought this tent down.  Poles seem flimsy.  This review gets one star because the size was perfect and tent was roomy.

  Very happy with this tent so far.  I haven’t been able to set it up and use it in rainy weather yet, so I’ll have to report back later on weatherproofing.This tent set up just as quickly and easily as my previous instant tent did.  It takes a little getting used to the “solid/hinged door”, as it relies on a pole system on the outer rim that zips up in the door.  Once figured out, all was good, but it sucks having a second zipper running along the outer edge of the door, as this can get confusing as myself and one other person already mistook it during first use as a regular zipper to open the door.PRO:  because of the dark nature of this tent, it seems to be a thicker material and did a good job cutting down wind on a breezy and chilly night.  Something not advertised in the ability of this tent.To say that it cut down on the amount of light coming in would be an understatement.  There’s nearly no light let in and most of it that does come in comes through a zipper or two that you haven’t fully met up on the doors or windows.I will keep this updated once I get a full season out of this tent!  Hopefully!

   This is a good tent under most weather conditions.I have used this tent for nearly 2 years at scouting campouts. Our scouts tend to be rainstorm magnets and this tent has endured quite a bit. I have never sealed the seams or done anything extra to the tent. I've used it and the rainfly straight from Coleman. The tent and I have endured rain and wind and faired very well. Once I had to sleep in the center of the tent because of the way the wind was blowing the sides of the tent in, and there was some water around the edges, but we survived--until this last weekend.We had a day of high winds and an evening of storms with continued high winds. The clips attaching the rainfly to the tent were unable to hold the fly on, but the guylines kept it from blowing away. (See attached video.) (In illustration, port-a-potty was lifted off the ground and tipped over.) During that extended straight line wind, after a day of enduring the wind, the stakes gave up and my tent with cot, foam tile square floor, rubbermaid storage containers and everything inside, began rolling away. We chased it down and it took 3 of us to drag it back, but the tent survived.We restaked the tent and tried again. This time, the stakes held, but the tent did not. The tent legs broke free from where they were attached to the base of the tent at the corners causing the tent to collapse. (See attached photo.) One tent pole was bent under the pressure. At this point, I went and slept in my truck.This tent has endured some pretty intense storms before and done fine. This one was just too much. A friend with a similar tent was able to tie his tent to a fence and he faired much better.All-in-all, it's a great tent. After rolling away and later collapsing, I believe it only has one damaged tent pole that I will look into replacing. We will continue to use this tent, although, I will look for a lower profile tent for campouts with thunderstorms in the forecast.

  It’s a fine tent, and I gave it 4 stars because I think that’s fair, even though I wish I hadn’t bought it.I also have the 6-person version, which I really love, but I bought this 4-person version to use for camping when it’s just my wife and I. It seemed more sensible - I mean, a “4-person” tent should be plenty for 2 adults. Right? Well, not really.In the 6-person version those adults can stand up! Not so, in this 4-person version. Also, it is very, very difficult to get in and out of this tent when someone is sleeping on the door side. If it could zip open on either side, that would be ideal. The getting up in the middle of the night to “go” situation is what makes me really regret having purchased this tent.One more thing to know about these tents... When put away, they are much much larger than a regular tent of similar size. Concern about storage and transportation was the main reason I didn’t just get another 6-person of the same type.Considering that the price difference between the 4 and 6-person versions is so tiny, I’d only recommend the 4-person for kids. Adults, who tend to use inflatable air mattresses or cots won’t be as happy. While they technically fit, it’s just to awkward to move around in there.Now, for a single adult, this tent would be fine.

  Very disappointing. This is the second Coleman tennis we’ve bought in 3 years. The first one was a 8-10 person and it was unmanageable for me to open it when it was wet (post rainy camping trip). I’m 5’3” and pretty strong but I couldn’t get it open. Poles stuck and thevtebt kept flopping over. Too heavy to open and prop up to dry out. A pole snapped at a bending point and that was the end. It lasted 5 camping trips.This 6 person tent we used for 2! Again it got wet, 1st time I had nothing problem opening it to air out. Now the 2nd time after airing it out (another rainy camping trip)I tried to close it carefully and a pole snapped right at the top center point inside. I also noticed a screw was missing that bolts one of the plastic brackets to the top on another pole.  I’m beginning to think these tents aren’t made so we’ll no matter what size you buy.

   The support pole was on backward. If I did not have a small Phillips on hand for another reason, I would have had a much worse experience. The black coating that is supposed to block light is full of holes that let light in. The knot used to hold tension on the guy line was too small and easily slipped through. It was easily corrected when I set up the tent for the first time but, I am not being paid to assemble tents. That is what I paid Coleman to do. I made a video to further illustrate the details.I do not trust this coating to last. I do not trust the quality system at Coleman. That means that I do not trust the people at the top that create the priorities they have established. That means that I will not be purchasing Coleman products. There is a Coleman factory in our area. I would like to support the home town team......

  If you are looking for a roomier tent that you can stand up in and to blockout the early morning sun this is the tent for you.We are a family of 5 with three boys 9,3,2. I bought this tent because we wanted one that was easy to assemble, block sunlight for those times when we need to put the kids down for a nap or earlier bedtime or to sober up with a nap mid day. Our tent was up within 3 minutes with two adults. I do recommend setting it up once or twice before camping because it is a bit confusing if you’ve never had an instant pop up tent.We camped in the Colville National Forest in WA next to the lake and there was a thunderstorm our second night camping we had already sprayed the tent with water resistant spray and I would say the tent help pretty well. There was a few leaks but it’s to be expected with any tent mostly at the corners the walls were damp to the touch but it did pour rain for about 10 hours so I can’t complain. If you are experiencing rain I recommend spraying it first and don’t put anything in the corners of the tent just to be safe.We had two queen air mattresses could easily fit a 3rd but I prefer a twin for the 3rd mattress to there is still enough room for clothes bag and changing area.My favorite parts is that while all the other campers were awake at 6-7am we were still sleeping because of the blackout affect my kids didn’t wake up till 9am! And the door has a pole that allows it to be closed but not zipped so my kids are messing up the zipper each time they go in and out durning the day only zipped it up for bedtime.Our tent was the tent to have. My brother who has a fairly new tent and is 6 3 was like I need this tent like now and he camps more then me and had a brand new baby. Would recommend to all my family and friends who love to camp.I will post an update after our next camp trip with more visual pictures and possible improvements for weather protection.

  I just got this tent today, so of course I haven't actually camped in it yet, but I went right out and set it up. It went up so fast, and it was almost accidental...just by handling the poles, it almost set itself up. If it took a full minute, it didn't take a second more than that, and I wasn't even trying to see how quickly I could do it.Because the tent doesn't come with a rain fly, I also got a 12x14 tarp to go with it, and I hung that over the tent when I set it up today. With guy lines holding the tarp nice and snug and draped down over the tent, it looks like I will be able to keep the windows halfway down in a rainstorm and still be fine. That's a lot better coverage than the official Coleman rain fly for this tent.I wish it had a floor vent, but with four huge windows and a ceiling vent, I think it should be more than fine. I have a standard issue U.S. Army cot that will fit inside with plenty of room left over (I'm using this tent to solo camp).Do yourself a favor and buy some good quality tent stakes. My tent didn't come with any stakes (and I'm not sure if it was supposed to), but I've read a ton of reviews that said the Coleman stakes are garbage, so I ordered some good metal official issue Army tent stakes. If I end up bending those, I must be talented.The tent is very roomy inside, and I love being able to stand upright in it - that was one reason I chose this model. It's called a six-person tent, but don't kid yourself. Six people would have to really, really, really like each other to squeeze into this tent. I do think it could fit four without their gear, or fewer with some gear. Two people would love this tent and have plenty of room. Since I'm camping solo, it's like a small house for me.Recommended? Absolutely.

Had read other reviews about purchasing the rainfly and sealing the tent before use to make it extra water proof. So I did. Sealed the tent and separate rainfly (both seam sealer and spray on sealer) not only once but twice before our trip. So I did 2 coats of sealing. The first night of use we had a short down pour.... LEAKED.... walls on the inside were wet and dripping from the storage nets inside. Second night.... a steady rain and we woke up with saturated pillows, sleeping bags, and you could literally watch the rain running down the inside of the tent. I am not an inexperienced camper and have owned multiple tents.... this is by far the worse tent purchase I have EVER made.  We wound up driving all the way back home to switch out this tent for the smaller Ozark Trail tent that we had been using for 3 years (without ever sealing mind you!!!!) and  drying our pillows and bedding. WE left this tent in the dumpster at the campground...... DO NOT BUY THIS TENT...... worst purchase ever!

    The WORST. Zero stars. Not worth the standing room.

  This tent is awful. I don't usually write long reviews but I need to for this one because this was so bad:Good:It's meant to have standing room so it does a better job of that than dome tents.Looks good.Easy to set up.Bad:Door: the door opens only on the right side and only half way, so if you sleep on the opposite side, you have to crawl everything and everyone to the zipper, then crawl over everyone to get out and the same to get back in. The door is also difficult to close because there is tension in the top corner so you literally have to pull the door up towards the wall for the zipper to close. Insane.Small inside: My version was for ""4"" people, there is no way 4 people fit in there. Barely fits a queen inflatable mattress for two people and their stuff. The floor space is severely limited by the door design, maybe that's why an equivalent dome tent would feel more roomy.Heavy and very bulky: It is very heavy and very bulky, even for a ""small"" 4 person tent. I have another tent that is a dome tent and it's about 2 feet across and a radius of a bout 9 inches when packed. This is about 3.5 feet across and a radius of 1.5 feet across. It is gigantic, even when packed. Furthermore, after unpacking it for the first time turns out that it doesn't pack back into the same bag!!! Knowing this, the bag is designed to be ripped in the middle in order to expand it when packing it back up! WHAT?! So when you leave for camping it takes up X amount of space, but when I came back it took up 2X amount of space in my car...Awkward windows: there are three windows which all unzip down, but they are not under a rain cover, so you are exposed when they are open. So much for standing room.Lack of ventilation: if the windows are rolled up the only ventilation you get is a small 6 inch slit in the top, no air goes in or out.Material absorbs moisture: I don't what this material that they use, but it absorbs condensation overnight and then whatever is touching the walls is wet. My pillow was wet. My clothing was wet. And this is camping in very dry woods in the middle of the summer.Does not come with a rain cover: it didn't rain when I was camping, but the sloping sides and open windows would presumably just let the water completely in. So if you are in rain, you have to completely close all the windows. If you do that you are in a sauna.Summary: don't buy this tent. However, my friends have the 6 person version, and for the two of them it seems to work a bit better, because no issues with door access and cramped spacing.

    Not Even Close to Water Resistant
  
",1.0,Robert J. Golde,"Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2019","









  
  
    
  I purchased this tent in June 2016 specifically because of the ""video"" showing only a microscopic amount of water entering the tent during a simulated rain test.  I have used the tent 3 times.  The first two times I was in the desert during the dry season.  The tent was great!  The third time I used the tent was in Big Sur, California.  This time my wife and young son were with me.  I knew it was going to rain the first night, but I had no worries because of the video.  I assured my wife; all would be good and that any rain we experience will be far less intense than the simulated storm in the video.  I told her “no water would get into the tent.”  The first night, as forecast, it rained.  The rain was not intense like in the video, but it did rain consistently for many hours.  By morning, there was well over a gallon of water pooled on the floor of the tent.  The rainwater did not come in through a hole or seam in the tent.  Rather, it permeated through the entire surface area of the top and the walls of the tent.  Fortunately, we were on cots and tall air mattresses.  If not, we would have been drenched in cold rainwater.

    Meh. Awesome tent setup but....
  
",2.0,James S.,"Reviewed in the United States April 29, 2018","









  
  
    
  I really wanted to like this tent. The setup is amazing! It’s super impressive. But... first time out  a window zippper broke. They are super cheap and flimsy so I’m sure it won’t be the last. The points where the tent connect to the frame are already splitting, they will won’t last.One that really got me was this IS NOT a 6 person tent. Not even close. MAYbe six small people shoulder to shoulder with absolutely no gear. My petite wife, seven year old son and I were cramped - with three day packs for one night. I’d go so far as to say this false advertising - very misleading.And yes putting it up is great! So easy!  Even the mechanisms that hold the bars at the top are super solid and well built. But unfortunately it’s pretty much a gimmick because of taking it down. There is no easy, clean way to do it. I felt like I was surely going to rip a side as I squeezed poles together and crammed it into the bag. Unless you know how to pack a parachute, it’s a mess. Better hope your site is pretty clean.Oh, the fly. I had to buy a fly separately! Come one man, that thing probably costs a buck to make.If this tent had heavier duty zippers, reninforced stress points at the pole connection, and a more effective way to pack it - it would be an incredible purchase. But I guess it would cost a ton more.If ya do a trip a year in good weather, by some ductape and enjoy. Otherwise look elsewhere. I think Coleman should stick to stoves for now. Oh or sleeping bags. My wife loves hers!Disclaimer, I just got back from our trip and just set the tent back up to dry it out completely from condensation - and attempt to pack it up neatly - currently frustrated because I just can’t get it.

    This Is An Awesome Tent That I Highly Recommend!
  
",5.0,Arthur Senior,"Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2019","Tents come in many shapes and sizes, each have their positives, and their negatives. Some tents are cheap, while other's, really expensive. The best tent for you, is going to depend on what you need from a tent, and how much money you are willing to spend. Most people who like to camp in the summer time, will probably be satisfied with a tent like this one. While other's who camp in extreme cold temperatures, might be inclined to go with one of those super thermal padded tents.

PACKAGING: Coleman loves to double pack these tents. When you receive your package, and open it up, it reveals the Coleman bag as seen in photo 1. If you unzip the Coleman bag, it reveals another box! Once you open up that box, finally, you will be able to pull your tent out of the box to begin deploying.

DIMENSIONS: The dimensions of the tent are, 10 feet long, by 9 feet wide, and 6 feet tall. I chose a tent this big because I wanted enough space. However, they always overstate a tents capacity. It may fit up to 6 small children. But in reality, this tent can only house up to 4-adults, and up to 2-adults comfortably.

PITCHING: Pitching the tent, is not as quick as the company says, which should be no surprise to no one. If you had 2-people working together, you could perhaps do it in 60-seconds. However, I pitched it all by myself, and it took closer to 2-minutes. When you compare this design to a dome tent however, you will take much longer to set one of those up. All you have to do, is stand the spider column (as I call it) upright, then unfold each leg, until the tent is flat on the ground. Then begin extending each leg of the tent, until the button snaps through the slots. Again, it will be a bit cumbersome for 1-person to do, however, still faster then setting up a dome tent.

Once the tent is pitched, and you've stretched all the legs outward, then begin setting up your guidelines. If your tent is on earth, you can use the included stakes they give you, to stake the tent down using the guidelines. Additionally, if you plan to camp on days where it will be raining, you really need to waterproof the tent with the optional rainfly accessory, model 2000010331. The rainfly is nearly impossible to put on, via 1-person, once the tent has been pitched up. I recommend 2-people to install the rainfly. The rainfly secures to the tent via plastic C-clips. And the rainfly comes with its own stakes and guidelines, to secure to the earth.

INGRESS: The tent has only 1-entry point, the front door. And unlike most tents, which the door spans the entire front half of the tent, this tent's door, only opens 1/2 of the front opening. I would have liked to have seen the full width being used. There are instant popup tents that are larger in size, that do use full width doors. As typical with all tents, it is double zippered, so you can close and open it from within.

WINDOWS: This tent is fully loaded when it comes to windows! There is literally windows on every side of this tent, all of them have 2-zippers per window. Each window has a mesh screen to keep bugs out, and each can be rolled down and secured with the knobs they provide. The reason they didn't use the full width for the door, is because they wanted to put a window next to the door as well. So rest assured, if your camping in the summer time, you are going to get plenty of ventilation.

VENTS: Now this is where I can be a bit nit picky when it comes to vent locations. On larger tents, they often put the vents close to the bottom of the tents, usually located in the back, or on the sides of the tent. But they chose to put the vents on the top of the tent on this model. I guess if your camping in the summer time, since heat rises, having them on the top makes sense. But if your camping in the winter time, its only going to let all the heat out. And if your running propane heaters, such as the buddy heater, you really want it to intake air from the bottom of your tent. Also, if you close the vents, there is still no way to make them seal in their closed position, so they will still vent when you don't want them to. The vents also come with zipper meshes, as well as the velcro strap that keeps them open.

MATERIAL: The materials that this tent consist of, 150D Polyester, and Taffeta 150D. They use taped seams, inverted welded seams, and use rugged polyguard. I'm not an expert on tents, so I can't tell you the values of these materials, or how they are constructed. What I can tell you, is that no integrated weathertek system is going to completely waterproof the tent without the rainfly accessory. However, for a super light sprinkle, you can get away with it.

For the most part, this tent feels like quality to me. A lot of times, companies will cheap out on the zippers, but these ones seem pretty good. The material makeup of the tent seems fairly solid, and the aluminum legs also seem pretty good. The spider column was fairly easy to work with when setting up the tent, so I think it is durable enough as well. Do I think the materials would hold up in winds up to 50MPH or more? No, absolutely not! But who's camping in stormy winds?

ACCESSORIES: The tent comes with several accessory points that I like. Outside the tent above the door, there is a loop where you can hang a lantern, mosquito repellent, etc. Inside the tent are two mesh pockets, one close to the door on the side of the tent, and the other on the back half of the tent, on the other side. These mesh pockets can be used to store cell phones, keys, lighters, emergency supplies, pretty much anything you need small pockets for. The tent also comes equipped with a lantern hanger. But if your lantern only has a handle instead of a hook, you will need to use a carabeener to attach to the lantern hanger.

EXPERIENCE: Most of you are going to use a tent to go camping. While I would love to go camping personally, I no longer have a vehicle, so I have no access to camping sites. Instead, I am thinking outside the box, and solving a problem I have. I lease my workshop, therefor I do not own the building. When you are leasing, its illegal for the renter to make changes to the building, its up to the person who owns the building to do that. The sheet metal roof of my workshop leaks when it rains. When it snows heavy, snow also falls in from the ridge cap. And since my shop is not insulated, it gets mighty cold in there during the winter time, there is just no way to heat it.

NOTE: Absent T land owners are not fun. They don't consider you important, and they refuse to fix problems. But they love to go numerous vacations every year all over the world, with the money they make from your rent payments. Capitalism at work fellas.

To solve this issue, I bought this tent, I knew that it would solve two problems for me. First, keep the rain off of my most important machines, and provide heat to keep the freezing cold at bay. Also, I wanted a space where I could do work in warmer temps. As you can see from the pictures, the tent fits the available space I have in the shop quite well. I ran an electrical cord up through the top vent, so that I can have power to run a light, space heater, and a charger.

I used a 32-WATT LED worklight as my light source, I just used a small bungee cord wrapped around the light's frame several times, then put both the hooks onto the lantern hanger attachment. While it may be crude, it works, and thats all that counts. I run the space heater on low, its set to 65 degrees F, and it oscillates to move the heat around. When I am not working in the tent, I store my 2-best mowers inside, and a scooter. The mower closest to the camera, I actually bought on Amazon!

I use an outdoor wireless thermometer to monitor the temp inside the tent, thats how I dialed in the heater. Also, to protect the tent floor from tearing, as I am moving heavy equipment in and out of it, I chose to line the floor with cardboard, and taped the cardboard together. And since I unfortunately do not have carpet material, I chose to just staple some blankets to the cardboard. If anybody has any knowledge on where I can get carpet to line this square footage on the cheap, please let me know.

When the temperature is in the 30's, I am able to maintain 54 degrees F with the heater on low. (750-WATTS) When the temperature is in the 40's, I am able to maintain 60 degrees F. If I through the heater on high, (1500-WATTS) I could easily hit the mark of 65 degrees F while its in the 30's out there. But I don't want to use that much power on my bill, so I chose not to. For those of you who plan to use a propane buddy heater, make sure your vent is open, otherwise you will burn up all your oxygen and become asphyxiated. A propane heater generally puts out more BTU's of heating power, but at a price of consuming propane.

CONCLUSION: I am known to do things in unique ways, and this tent is no exception. While this tent is a very simple solution to a larger problem, it is both cost effective, ingenuitive, and it just works for me. Nobody can wait on absent t owners to handle things. And there was no way I was going to spend 1000 dollars of my own money to insulate the workshop and fix the roof leaks. I really love my tent, it works really well, and I think you will love it too, if you choose to buy it. Despite a few of my nit picks, I am going to give this a solid 5 out of 5 stars!",Style: 6-person

    A Good 10-person Dark Tent
  
",4.0,Brando,"Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  My wife and I camp upon our lake property every weekend.  We use this Coleman 10-person Dark Room Cabin Tent to suit our needs for the last 3 months of use...PROS: It fits a Queen Sized Air Mattress and end tables quite well, plus a camping chair and storage totes.  The floor is made of tarp-material, and has held up well to constant dirt, foot traffic, and dragging things along it.  The Dark Room tech is great!  I get to sleep in when the sun comes up, however, it's still a tent and the material doesn't block the sunlight as much as a dark, thick curtain would on a window.  The rainfly is great too because not only does it latch on to the tent stake-down points, has its own lines to stake-down, but it also connects itself to the tent poles too using velcro.  And what more, the seams are already sealed for you.  I also like the zippered hole for an extension cord, rather than folded tent material or velcro.CONS:  We've survived a severe thunderstorm in this tent already.  I used weatherproofing spray (Kiwi Brand) and Coleman's own seam sealer; and not a drop of rain landed on us.  However, water did slowly drip in through the bottom seams of the windows, and where the tent material meets the tarp floor, were some leaks too.  End result was a few tiny puddles of water along the sides of the tent (not even a cup-worth of water), but otherwise the tent held up like a champ to a very harsh and long downpour with a bit of wind too.  Also, the tent poles tend to twist and bend sometimes making extending the poles a bit tricky to do, or folding the tent up hard to do.  Which you will not be able to get this tent back in the bag so easily.  The main tent stakes are good and strong, the rainfly tent stakes are weak and I recommend replacing those.  Lastly, the pole for the door broke on us.  It's supposed to bend as part of being the door, but I guess not strong enough to withstand constant use.CONCLUSION:  Great tent!  Very pleased with the product.  Just make sure you waterproof the tent and rainfly, and you'll be okay.  Lastly, we've had some cold nights at the lake (upper 40s, lower 50s temps) and this tent does not hold in heat due to the mesh top, protected only by the raised rainfly.  Recommended summer-use only.

  This tent took on more water than expected that became a bit burdensome having to deal with removing it every few hours.My son and I just returned from a 3 day camping trip in the snow up at Buck Creek, which is at the base of Crystal Mt.There was a good foot of snow whe we arrived, but was fairly clear under the trees.It snowed mildly on the first day and we did add the rain fly when we erected the tent.The 60 second erection time is no joke. I just wish it had lived up to its other expectations.I placed a tarp on the ground and folded the exposed edges under the tent as is standard tent protocol. Within the first couple hours my son noticed drips at almost every seem running down the side while we were inflating our beds and rolling out bags. I placed towels there to collect the water at the bottom edges and moved our pads away from the walls.We left for a few hours to unload the truck and set up our camp area.I sent my son back to the tent to grab something and he yelled for me to come there quick.When I got there I had noticed that the towels were now soaked and water was leaching way from then.I rang them out and replaced them.The snow increased on day two and we got about 6 inches overall.Luckily for us the temps dropped and froze the water overnight. We woke up to a bunch of water around and under our pads in the first morning after sleeping in the tent. And had to deal with water intrusion all day until the temps dropped.I will be reaching out to Coleman because I have feeling that perhaps my tent was a manufacturing defect. I've had numerous Coleman tents in my 43 years and never had an issue like this.I gave this 3 stars simply based on my experience with my particular tent.Also be known that this was a brand new and first time use experience.Because of their history of quality tents, I'm going to exchange it and give it another shot.We left after

  My experience:It was about 7 PM when we got to the campsite and it IMMEDIATELY started raining.  I had the tent maybe half-way up when the ranger decided now would be a perfect time to take care of check-in.  As we discussed the rules and regulations of the camp site, it rained harder and harder.  Finally, after about 10 minutes, I was able to finish the tent.It already had water in it as the rain fly was still not attached but my wife and I powered through it.  That's when it REALLY started raining.  Couldn't get a fire started, realized the jacket I brought wasn't water proof, gave up on the rain tarp to cover food and equipment.  We all huddled into the tent.It must have rained heavily for about 3 hours.  And when it wasn't heavily raining, it down poured until about 4 AM. When we woke up the next morning, there was about 2 cups of water total in the tent.  We learned if anything is touching the sides of the tent, water would easily come through.  If nothing was touching, it did pretty well.I would still give this tent 5 stars as I had seam sealer and water-proof spray......In the car.  If I would have sprayed beforehand, I don't think a single drop would have made it in.  For the price of this tent, adding sealer and water-proofing spray is a REQUIREMENT.  I got the Kiwi Camp Dry, it'll take about 4 cans.I also added a sunshade/rain fly to the entrance.  When you step out of the DARK tent, the sun can take a little time to adjust to.

  So this tent seems to be a love it or hate it affair for people on here. I can see how some people would like it but it really was not for me and it does leak some and gets you wet with condensation in any case.I took this tent to Maine as we were car camping and then day hiking Katahdin.Pros:1. The tent is huge. You can stand up in it and the floor space and vertical style walls make it feel very big.2. The tent does set up in 2 -5 minutes.Cons:1. Water Water Everywhere: You get wet. The first night camping it was going to be cold so I closed the windows but left the top vents open. I was awoken an hour into my sleep with cold wet water dripping on my face. I immediately sprung to action thinking i needed to start sealing the tent up as it must be raining. Well it was not. The tent is so airtight that I was having the condensation from the roof dripping on me. This occurred with the top vents open and with only 2 people in the tent. I then half opened all the windows. This made it quite cool and still did not solve the condensation issue it continued to drip all night waking me periodically. The next night we were hit by a rainstorm. There were several leaks that I had to fix. I also had nearly a cup of water dumped on my head but was quick and caught it. On the top of the tent near the vents a puddle had begun to form I was able to guide it to the side of the tent before it came through the vent screen. Since it was raining all the windows had to be closed so I still got very wet from condensation. There are several hooks to hang things inside the tent on the center of the walls, these seemed to wick water in from the outside.I therefore cannot recommend this tent based on the fact that no matter what you will get wet. But wait there is more...2. Weight and Size: The tent is very heavy and the bag it comes in quite large. You could have trouble getting this in some vehicles.3. Breakdown: While set up is breeze breakdown is not. This took almost 20 minutes to break down. Also make sure you open all the vents as this is a big plastic bag and if you don't you will never wrap it up unless you reset it up climb inside and open them. It took 3 people to do this task and we still had a hard time getting it back in the bag.Overall this was just too bulky, too wet, and too difficult to pack and travel with. I learned a lot from this tent.My tent advice:1. Get something smaller and lighter. Even when car camping set up breakdown and packing your car will be easier with something smaller. Plus you can take something smaller on a hike as well.2. Get something that breathes. There are tents that keep the rain out and don't drip condensation. A dome with a rain-fly will allow humidity out through the mesh onto the rain-fly and then down the side of the rain-fly. This is a better design than a one for all ""water-proof"" tent like this.3. Set it up and break it down before you need it at home. This was you know all the ins and outs ahead of time. It also allows you to test for missing or broken parts.

  We love this tent! For our family of 4 + Bernese Mountain Dog, it gives us all of the room that we need and then a little extra. It’s perfect for us for our rare 2x a year camping excursions and also for movie nights in our backyard. The darkening feature + size was a major selling point for me as I don’t typically enjoy sleeping on the floor outside and waking up when the sun wakes up. When this happens, I’ll let you know how I feel about it. However, I can tell you that it is so dark and much cooler in there even during the day (so much so that I’d definitely enjoy a peaceful afternoon nap in there). Can’t speak on the waterproof/weatherproof aspect as I’d simply refuse to ever go camping in the rain. So from a glampy mom who sleeps inside while her husband camps in the backyard with the kids, I would highly recommend this tent to every quarantined Mom with age appropriate children looking for a peaceful evening inside with a bottle of wine while she catches up on Bravo television.

  So this tent was okay. Like other photos I've seen, it appears they have sealed the corners with... duct tape? I don't understand that but.. I would recommend putting a tarp under your tent, plus get a decent thermal tarp to put on the floor inside to help insulate and provide additional water proofing.I did use a Mr. heater buddy inside the tent and got mild condensation around 20-30F after running the heater 3-4 hours. Wasn't ever enough to drip on me or build up on the walls, mostly found it on the corners of the floor maybe a few tablespoons worth.Ventilation is great, has a good two zipper door system, and the doors have windows you can unzip, with two large side windows with strong dual zippers, and one full wall, also has a a top vent that is so-so.Final thoughts, if I had a family I would get the 6 person instant tent not only for the room but the extra height. My 4 person I can almost stand in but its only 5' tall so I have to hunch a bit, 6 person has I believe more than 6' of head height. Oh, also get the rain tarp that is sold separate, its much needed and keeps heat in.

  We wanted something easy to set up and this tent delivered. It’s so easy that my wife set it up by herself in about five minutes. It’s also lighter than anticipated so you can carry it for short hauls to the campsite. It has lots of windows so it’s well-ventilated but you can also totally close the tent up. My kids didn’t have any trouble with the zippers. My family of four had plenty of space for sleeping and we were able to keep our spare clothing in there as well. The pockets on top and the sides are nice for LEDs. The included metal stakes are too short, smooth and thin to be used for holding down the tent although we were able to use them for the foundation tarp that we use underneath the tent. For windy conditions you’ll want to buy some real stakes. Thus far we’ve only used this tent in mild weather so I can’t attest to its performance in wind, rain or cold. An 8x10 tarp fits perfectly inside the tent. At $129 this tent is tough to beat and we’re very happy with it.

I searched and researched Kelty, Ozark, REI, Eddie Bauer, and Coleman. REI was the next closest, but their easy set up tent was not the right size.Pros:•SO EASY to set up. I did it myself in 1 minute, 50 seconds (not including the rain fly or staking).•The floor seems solid and water proof. We left it out all night on a damp evening and of course it was wet on the bottom but there was no moisture inside.•The door zippers are well covered by flaps keeping dirt and rain out. (Photo)•The roof/ceiling opens and has a screened vent for humid or hot climate. (See photo)•We can stand in it. I’m 5’10” and I have a 4” clearance. (Photo)• Plenty of room for two people and their stuff.•Lots of ventilation and big windows.•Pole corners have padding on them so as not to tear the rainfly.Cons:•Does NOT come with a rainfly. Don’t forget to order one.•Took a lot long to take down and was difficult to get into the bag.•Came with webbed straps that were tied around the tent and don’t have buckles and will never fit again. Had to get themon Amazon. Poor planning when the rest of the tent was so well thought out, Coleman.I don’t know about rain resistance but will edit later if we come across it.So happy that I can set it up myselfQuickly.

  We wanted a simple but good starter tent and this fits the bill well. Very good quality, I particularly like the WeatherTec system that seems very solid and should keep us dry in the event of rain. Costs a few dollars more than some similar tents but has the quality /features to be with it. Very roomy easily fits 2 adults and 3 year old with room to spare.

  Good:Only positive note about this tent is the setup.  Once it's taken out, setting it up is a breeze.  Unfold the legs and extend all fours and it's ready to go.Bad:Bulky and heavy.Definitely not waterproof or whatever this Weather Tec claims to be.  I had the rainfly on, tarp underneath, even applied the sealant around all the stitchings but did not hold up against the rain this weekend.  Other tents around me got minimal rain inside, this one did not hold up well and puddles in all corners and by the entrance.  My older tents held up much better in extreme weather.Trying to put the tent back in the bag is also a very daunting and challenging task.  I am usually good rolling the tents up tightly but this onewas definitely not easy with the frame/legs attached.  (and did i mention it's huge already?)Overall, i'm not impressed with this tent if i could return it, i'd do it in a heartbeat.This will only be used knowing 150% there is no rain in the forecast.

  What a fantastic and quick tent to put up literally under 60 seconds!I have a very bad back and am limited, so I was in desperate need of an easy tent to put up by myself & I finally found a great one that is so quick and easy.I also liked the fact that the top is solid material and not the typical mesh top, so this prevented any breeze from coming in & helped me stay warm in 26*f & 15*f  temps in the Sierras in October.There are 4 windows that unzip so during the day I was able to open them up so I could get airflow.The 6 person tent had plenty of room for my double high queen air mattress, a side table, a stand and my portable heater, as well as my belongings and I was able to stand up straight in it. (I’m 5’6”)Only 2 pet peeves about this tent and the first was that even after staking down the corners of the tent and back, the floor was not taught and had some buckling, (My Coleman Montana 6 person dome tent was nice and taught), so that was a bit awkward, so I had to spread out my belongings along the bottom of the walls of the tent to push out the buckled material of the tent.The other part that really does bother me is that the tent once taken down, (just as quick as putting up), does not fold up as easily as a dome stake tent and this was extremely hard for me to put back into the bag it came in.I struggled hard the second time and due to my back I gave up. (I have yet to get it back in. :(

  I'm not a tenter!  I used to have both a van set up for camping, and an old Dodge Champion motorhome.  I'm too old to mess with a tent!  However a bluegrass festival came up that I did not want to miss, and my Coleman tent trailer wasn't available so I took a chance and bought a Coleman 6  person tent.  First off, this tent would comfortably hold no more than FOUR people.  I can't imagine 6.  Secondly this tent should NEVER be purchased without a rain fly!!!  SHAME ON COLEMAN AND AMAZON TOO.......for letting this happen.  That's the reason for the four star rating.In the tent's favor, it really is ""instant.""  A fellow camper insisted (curious about the tent,) on ""helping"" me set the tent up.  The tent was up BEFORE EITHER OF US KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.  True!  You take it out of it's carrying case, spread it out on the ground, and as soon as you start walking around it and erecting the tent poles.......the tent just sorta......happens, no kidding.  This tent went up so fast, I'm still not sure how it sets up, but it does.Come time to take it down, it also was easy.  One tip I got from reading another review, was to half open the windows, leave them zipped half way and tuck the flap between the tent and the screen mesh, in order to let the air out, when rolling the tent up.  Worked for me.We had weather.......unbelievable!  Up in the mountains, in upstate New York's Lake George area and one minute there'd be sweltering heat, and the next minute a HUGE dark grey cloud would show up, and a DROWNPOUR would happen.  At one point, I ran to check the tent and the water around it was shoe top deep!  No kidding!!!  And, nothing and I mean NO WATER AT ALL, inside........except for a corner of the window I'd left down, unfortunatley close to the air mattress, (not good,) but all in all the tent did fine.Wind......incredible wind!!!  Thru all of this, this tent stood up very well, the only water inside would come from condensation because NO WAY could you leave a window open even the slightest!  Water would run down the sloping side of the tent and RIGHT THRU THE WINDOW SCREEN, and this.......is the reason I think it's a shame this tent is allowed to be sold without a rain fly.  I just ordered mine!  I'm hoping that with this tent fly, I'll be able to at least partially open the windows if it's raining.  This along with that clever top vent should help a lot.Hope this helps but again, this tent should never have been sold without the rainfly.  Shame on you Coleman.

  Excellent Tent. I give it a 5 Star review on the Tent alone. But, a 4 Star rating just because it doesn't come with the Rainfly. I should have read the description better. You have to turn around and spend approximately another $30.00 for the Coleman Rainfly that, in my opinion, should have been included. I have never purchased a tent that didn't have one included. Hey Coleman, I hope you end up reading this Review and take care of that issue. I KNOW that I am not the only person to say that, or even think that.

  I haven't taken this camping yet. I'll use it for real this weekend. But it arrived today and so I took it out back to set it up and make sure everything was in order.It does go up as quick as they say it will, and without really needing to read the instructions or anything. It seems to be well made, and it has the features you would expect a tent to have. Not a ton of bells and whistles, but that's not what tents are for.BUT, for as well made as this seems to be, and for as easy as it is to set up, the take down is unacceptably difficult. Not really the take down itself, but the packing it away. Getting it back into the carrying case is... not going to happen for a lot of people unless they exercise a lot of patience, which sort of undermines the whole point of having a quick tent. However easy it might be to set up, putting it away is a hundred times harder. While a traditional stick and pole tent will take 10 to 15 minutes to set up, and 10-15 minutes to take down and put away, this might take 1 minute to set up and 30 minutes to put away. The instructions also offer no insight whatsoever into how to fold the fabric to get it small enough so that it goes back in smoothly.To compound that problem, the carrying case is SUPER cheap. If you force this tent into the bag--which you're going to have to do because there is no other way, you're going to break the bag sooner or later. Probably sooner, it's super cheap.To me, this is unacceptable. They could have offered instructions on how to fold it precisely while taking the tent down so that it fits back into the bag easily, or they could have just included a bag that was 30% larger and it wouldn't have mattered.Anyway, it does feel like a solid tent, and it IS easy to set up. But, it's so abusively difficult to get it back into the bag, and the bag is so pointlessly tight and cheap, that this tent lost 2 stars.It's probably a fine tent, but just don't be fooled by the ""instant tent"" branding. realize what you're getting yourself into. Putting this thing away is a nightmare.

  The tent is great.  First time taking it out of the package, it took about 5 minutes for me to assemble because I'm a guy that thinks it is a crime to look at the instructions, otherwise it would have been about 60 seconds.As others have mentioned, there was some condensation on the inside of the tent when I woke up in the morning, but that is because Coleman couldn't change the laws of physics.  If it is humid and cold, water will condense on most types of matter.I bought the rain fly tent combo.  You should definitely not do that.  The tent rain fly combo is for a 6 person tent and a 4 person tent rain fly.

  I've had a regular tent my whole life and never knew any different.  On a recent camping trip my cousin joined us.  He got one of these used at an auction since he knew he needed a tent for this trip.  He had no idea what he was buying, just a tent.  He never bothered to even open it up to try it.  My buddies and I laughed at him when we read the 60 second set up on a tent he never set up before or learned how to use.  He opened it up and yes it may have taken him 120 seconds but there was no laughing only impressed faces looking at the heaps of canvas and poles that were our tents and he was going inside his.  I never even bothered to set mine up, I just bunked with him.  The 6 person was just right for 2 big guy and all their gear for a week.  We camp heavy. Needless to say, I had to have one before this years trip.  I gave my old traditional tent to my son. LOL.  I saw the Coleman darkroom version of these but I don't want a dark tent.  I want all the light coming in.  I'm not sleeping all day and don't sleep late.  I would really love it if they added the soft hinged door to this like some other Coleman tents offer.  The hinged door is so worth having.  One of the other guys has that on their old fashion tent.

  Bought this and set it up. After two hours of rain on it the seems along the windows started drip water as well as the seem on the roof which then dripped from the lantern attachment which of course is right above where we were sleeping. I'm sure they'll say it doesn't leak with the rain fly but if that's the case why does the description say that it doesn't leak without the rain fly and why is the rain fly sold separately? I gave three stars for the weight as it is a reasonable weight for car camping tent. Obviously not a backpacking tent. Set up and tear down were super easy and stows away great. The only problem is it leaks even in light rain. Good by if you're not planning to for it rain at all.

  Overall, this is very easy and fast to set up, so much so that I could do it alone. That's about where the good ends. We watched countless videos with this Coleman tent blowing about a storage facility with rainfall. I'm here to tell you, this is not accurate. We awoke to morning dew penetrating through the closed windows, creating quite a bit of water underneath us. As far as we could see, the seams were not the issue but rather the breathing material on the sides of the tent. For $100, there are other, better options out there. We also sprung for the separately sold rain cover and still had water in the tent. We are going to try to spray a weather protector such as neverwet but this will be reserved for warm dry weather and we will continue to be on the hunt for a better tent.

  We got this tent to car camp with our toddler and baby.  It’s spacious enough for a queen bed which we share with our 3 year old, and a pack-n-play for the baby, with room at the foot of the bed for luggage as well as plenty of entrance space to the tent which we also used as a play area.It’s very easy to set up and only takes a minute!  Also very easy to put away, but takes a little more time to roll it and get the air out so it’ll fit back in the bag (leave the windows open to make this part easier!)I know this has a “built-in” rain fly but we went ahead and bought the “real” rain fly as an accessory.  I’m glad we did- We had a lot of rain our first night and it held up remarkably well!  I wish they just included the detached rain fly with the tent.No leaks in the seams, and all of the seams have a plastic clear seal over them that you can see.  No leaks around the zippers!It’s a little big in the bag, but we were able to fit it in the back of our Prius with spare room for our other gear and kid stuff.We are very happy with the tent so far!

  It is as easy to set up as advertised.  We like the size and it has plenty of windows to let the breeze in.  The only issue we had is that the first time it rained, we had a large amount of water come in the sides (several gallons by morning), even with the rain fly on.  We have had many Coleman tents in the past so we knew this was not normal.  I would recommend this tent, but make sure to order the rain fly with it and check the waterproofing before going on a camp out.  I have noticed others that had the same issue so it seems that there are some manufacturing issues from time to time.

  Bought htis in April because the tent I had was tight for 4 people. Took it on its frist outing in June.Pros:The Setup was easy A+""Darkroom Technology"" is excellent, reall keeps light out and the tent interior did seem cooler during the day but this also has more than adequate venting.Hinged door is awesome  definately a benefit and the room divider is greatHad a little weather during the 3 days I was out and the tent handled it well. No leaksCons:10 peson tent? not quite. Not sure how they figure the measurments to get that number, 5 people comfortably.Durability, Out of the box one of the corner poles very hard to extend/ collapse. looking at it set up it appears to have a slight bend ( I am going to inquire id there is a replacement or if this is covered)while the floor seems durable the walls do not, at some point during mu drip the wind kicked up slightly and something like a small stome punchtured the tend wall a few inched abouve the floor seam. I can't imagine what would happen in a fall camp out where you can get real windIt is an EX-up but not so much an easy takedown for packing it all up.....I get that they put thinner material to keep the tent light but people using a ten person cabin style tent aren't looking for lightweight. the wall fabric needs to be a little thicker to make it more durable.Only one use and 2 issues, not major but still irritating. I don't envision getting more than a few seasons before this on has to go.Update: 07JUL20  I removed another star aside form the issues listed above the back this gets packed away in blew out the seam on one end so quality issue with the tent and the bag. only 2 uses and this many issues disappointing product from Colemen

  I am slow brained at mechanical things and my first Coleman tent I bought a decade ago took way too much time and frustration from my vacation in the great outdoors to figure out and it had too many pieces so I had to keep referencing the manual.  Plus I had to buy a duffle bag to keep it in because no average human could refit it in the case it came in.  Looks like Coleman too was slow brained, but now it's the opposite with this tent.  It really did take just a few minutes my first time setting it up.  I'm sure my second will be 60 seconds or less.  And afterward I was able to fit it in the carrying case, though I wish it were just a little bigger because I needed help squishing the sides together when zipping...like me now at size 14 trying to get into my wedding dress of 30 years ago.  I'm so glad I can put the tent up by myself.  I use an extra long cot from Walmart and had to set it on the diagonal to fit and even then it's poking the tent fabric a little on the outside.  There isn't much room left on either side of the cot's interior.  I'll keep this tent, but I wish I bought the tent for six people, even though I often camp alone.  I like having space to set a little desk and walk around.  I haven't been in rain yet, but I did spray the outside with water repellant.  I looked all around at the seams and didn't see the seam irregularities some here complained about.  It looks really pro.  In the middle of the day I went inside to take a nap on a day that was about 80-85 degrees.  It was pretty warm even with all the windows unzipped.  The sun was beating down directly overhead, so I'm ordering the rain top even though it doesn't rain much in So CA.  I'm thinking and hoping that maybe that rain top will deflect some of the heat from direct sunlight.  If you too are slow brained, I'd strongly suggest watching some online videos like on YouTube to see how people set up this tent before you begin.

  I've been using this tent for a few years now and love how easy it is to set up.  It's roomy and has lots of windows, as well as roof vents for a little extra circulation.The big problem with this tent is how terrible it is in rain.  I've seam sealed the all seams ,  sprayed waterproofer on it, and even purchased the separate rain-fly.  The side walls that sink inwards when they get wet.  The extra weight from the rain causes water to pool up on the seams near the floor, and then it simply drips inside.The odd part is there are tabs in the middle of the front wall, and back walls to pull everything taught, which allows the rain to simply run down the sides of the tent to the ground.  Why they didn't include these on the side walls just baffles me.overall great tent for dry weather.  but if you're going to be dealing with a few hours of rain get a large tarp.. this tent will not keep you dry.

  My tent requirements are:1. To stay dry2. To be able to stand up and change clothes3. To be super easy and fast to put up and downI really loved our Sundome 6, but the corner was ripped off of it (married to the Hulk) and I decided to try something different.I found the perfect tent on Pinterest, but it’s a Coleman only sold in Australia and I couldn’t afford the shipping to the US (more than the price of the tent). Australia and Britain have WAY better tent designs than we get, but they cost more.Don’t get me wrong- I really like this tent.  It goes up in 30 seconds, down in 60.  You can stand up in it.  Plenty of windows that roll up easily.  The door doesn’t swing (such a shame), but it has two separate door zippers (bottom zipper and top/side zipper- not one continuous zipper) so if you only unzip the side zipper it doesn’t flop in all over the floor like a traditional D-shaped door.  It does NOT have an e-port for your power cord, so it goes in the gap of the front door zippers.  Great tent overall.  But be prepared to buy these additional items:1. Gorilla Waterproof Tape- Black (for the floor)2. Gear Aid Seam Grip Seam Sealer (for the inside seams)3. Gear Aid Tenacious Tape (for the tent walls)4. Atsko Silicone Waterproofing Spray5. Ultralight Backpacking Tarp6. Flex Tape Clear (for your inflatable mattress, etc.)I don’t know where these tents are made, but my 7th grade Home Economics class could sew better than this.  There are several places where the stitching is crooked.  The seam sealing tape from the factory was put on crooked as well, leaving many stitch holes unsealed.  You can see through them.  No wonder the tent leaks!  The bathtub floor has places that look disintegrated, like it spent too long in a hot warehouse.  Why didn’t I return it?  I did!  This is the second tent.  I gave up and decided to fix the brand new tent myself.  I love the instant cabin concept, but don’t pay extra for the name Coleman, because that doesn’t mean anything anymore.  Plenty of other brands make instant cabin tents, even wallyworld, and they can’t be any worse than this one.  You’re just going to have to waterproof it yourself.  The rainfly (not provided and overpriced) doesn’t even cover all the seams, so I went with an ultralight backpacking tarp, which I rigged up with bungees and does a nice job.  The carrying case came with a rip-out piece to expand the size of the bag to get the tent back in.  Which it does- barely.  But my zipper promptly fell off, so I’m holding it together with straps until I can find a duffle to fit.In summary: great tent, but be prepared to finish the job.Line the interior seams with seam sealer,  patch over any obvious holes or worn spots with the appropriate medium, and then silicone spray the outside of the tent liberally.  The Flex Tape I’ve used for both air mattresses and the lining of the bottom my swimming pool- it holds up great and will stick and seal even when wet.You can use any kind of tarp, but I like ultralight because they feel like a taffeta rainfly.  This tent needs a rainfly, but not the one they sell.  That’s a joke.  The issue is if it rains- because of the shape of the tent- all windows must be zipped shut or you will flood out.  There is a rooftop vent, but it’s not enough and it gets too hot and downright miserable.  The goal is to be able to unzip the side windows and let a breeze through.  So the rainfly gets staked wide to keep rain from coming in the side windows, and then it’s comfortable.I eventually borrowed (stole) the rainfly from my Coleman Montana 8 tent and added pins to the front two feet to accommodate the pole.  That way I get a vestibule to step out into the rain (and not let rain fall in the front door).Why go through all this trouble?  Compromise.  My husband detests putting up and taking down tents, and I can do this by myself.  Once I got a notice on my phone of a straight line wind storm headed our way and I was by myself.  I was able to take down the tent (including rainfly, stakes, and ground cloth) and throw it inside in under 5 minutes.  Which was great because I don’t know how it would have handled the 85mph wind gusts that came at the 7 minute mark, but I doubt any tent would have survived.It’s not a perfect tent, but after all the improvements it now suits my needs.  Maybe I need to start designing my own tents?

I had to spend time searching their website to find the link to submit a warranty request.I provided 5 photos displaying the defect and wrote a description. They responded by saying I needed to take a picture with the reference number next to the logo. I did this and they responded that the reference number needed to be written in silver marker next to the logo directly on the tent. Who has time to hunt down a silver marker?? I didn’t have one and had to go to the store to buy one. This was very likely the most tedious, bureaucratic, time consuming and senseless process I’ve ever had to go through with a product under warranty. This tent would have likely been great without the defect but I’m so disappointed with Coleman’s horrible customer service!

  So it appeared easy to put up, but one corner did not snap in because the poles were assembled upside down from the manufacture. So after an hour to locate a Philips screw driver from another camper you had to remove screws at tent base and elbow rotate 180 degrees and put screws back in. Tent then worked fine was sagging on one corner it leaked about a 1/2 gallon of water during a thunder storm. So here where it gets worse breaking the tent down noticed the corner that was sagging all week was another pole assembled upside down but was some how locked in place I could not get the pole to compress or go in if that makes sense (there are little push buttons and pole collapse) so after a 2 hour setting up and an hour of trying to get pole in so tent would fit in the bag. I had no success I had to THOW IT AWAY. I had no room in my truck to bring a big pile of tent with all my other gear. I had no other choice WASTE OF MONEY. Colemans Quality control SUCKS ASS x1000.  DO NOT BUY

  Save your money!!! We have used this tent 3 times & there's definitely some design flaws along with poor craftsmanship by Coleman with this tent. Pros: Its easy to set up, dark technology is great - you could sleep during the day if you wanted because it is so dark inside & at night you can barely tell there is a light on inside, spacious but would not try to put 10 people inside. THE CONS: NOT WATERPROOF! even after coating the seams with a seam sealer and spraying the entire tent AND RAINFLY with the Coleman waterproof tent spray 2 x's we still had water pooling inside. Rainfly does not cover the windows. The door has a curved pole that has snapped in a few places (only on the 3rd set-up) & of course Coleman can not help with replacement parts, Coleman customer service is a joke!!! There are pictures online of a rainfly that goes all the way to the ground and covers the windows for this exact tent but it is not available in the united states at all, only in Australia. Ugh! So if you are not dealing with any rain this is a great tent, however if you are then I would recommend looking at other brands.

    Leaks badly
  
",3.0,Joel Hammer,"Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2019","









  
  
    
  I just bought it. Set it up on my lawn. Easy. Bought a bottle of Coleman's seam sealer. It only was enough for the roof and part of the walls. I did not waterproof the seam between the wall and the floor. This seam is several inches off the ground and with the seam turned in it is not exposed to the outside. I did not think it would leak.Last night we had high winds and a light to moderate rain. No downpours.This morning, there was a LOT of water all round the sides of the inside of the tent. The roof did not seem to have leaked.  I did buy the extra fly but I did not have it over the tent last night. This tent is advertised as having an integrated fly and that seems to have worked. My conclusion is that the high wind just blew the water into the seam between the wall and the floor.So, off to REI to buy some seam sealer. I was unhappy with the Coleman seam sealer since there was not much in the bottle and it had a pathetic applicator.I will update after I seal the floor seams.EDIT: I brought the REI seam sealer. Comes in pathetic 2 oz bottles like the Coleman sealant. It was like thin Elmer's glue. No smell. It ran a lot and the applicator was far from ideal.  The bottom seam is a nightmare. It is tucked in. So, which of the three resulting surfaces do you waterproof? You have 32 feet to work on, x3. I did the outside tuck and the seam inside (which has two surfaces.)  It still leaked, although not quite as bad as before after a night's rain. But, it did not rain as hard as the other night.  The entire seam on the inside was damp and water was inside the tent, but less than without the sealant. Now what? I am going to buy more Coleman sealant and repeat this process, since this Coleman sealant seems to have been successful on the roof of the ten. What a sham. Coleman should be ashamed of this tent.  Tucking in that bottom seam and not waterproofing it makes the consumer do triple the work to seal this seam.

  Do not buy this tent. Not sure what's going on with Coleman as they usually make a high quality product. The first tent I was sent had holes in the screen. The second tent leaked from almost every seam! Luckily we were camping close to home so we could drive the kids home. There were puddles forming in the bottom of the tent!! There will be no third tent.Also, be very careful with return windows. My first conversation with customer service left me with the understanding that I would be getting a full refund. When I contacted back to arrange pick up my estimated refund was about $40 shy. It took another contact with customer service before I had a written promise at a full refund. So I guess you need to spray your tent with water for about a half an hour or more if you cannot create a rainstorm on command.

  I haven't camped since I was little so this is my first tent as an adult and I am so happy with this purchase!  It's lightweight and so much more spacious than I thought it would be.  We had a queen and twin airbed in there with room for our bags and accessories.  It has two interior pockets that was handy for the flashlights, my book and some earplugs...with room to spare.  It also has a hook at the top center for a light, which was super handy.  I love all the mesh windows which all zip up at night!  It's perfect for 3 people.  I know it says 6 person but for it to function for us and leave room for bags and a little walkway between the beds, it fits 3 people very comfortably.  If we had a fourth we would have gone with the 8 or 10 person tent.  But I like size because it a smaller footprint so it fits into smaller campsites and you can still stand up fully in it.  The set up was a breeze!! It has this sort of ""pop up"" center that makes quick work of it and that's why I bought it. I'm too old (and lazy) to be messing with inserting rods and all that jazz.  The take down was just as easy...we took a small hand held broom and dust pan...swept the inside of the tent out and then as we collapsed the outside brushed off all the dirt and leaves before folding it all the way in. It's ready to pop up and move in next time.  We went ahead and got some cots for next time, to lift the air mattresses up off the ground, so we are not having to get up and down off the floor to change clothes and dress (remember, we're old!) lol and a little 3 foot folding bench for outside the tent door to take shoes on and off easier.  Pair that with a toilet tent and we can camp socially distanced quite well.  I love our little tent so much!  Highly recommend for a small family.

    Fits a queen air mattress w/ room to spare!
  
",4.0,J. Young,"Reviewed in the United States February 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've had numerous pole tents and decided it was time to move to something a little quicker to assemble.  The Coleman unit goes up in about a minute as advertised.  You unfold the supports from the center then extend each corner (there is a metal tab that locks into place once you've fully extended the poles) and that's it!I tested it at home first (pictured) and found setup and tear down to be very manageable.  I was even able to get the tent back into the bag (that's never happened)!Pictured is a queen air mattress that is 80x60x18.  You could easily fit a twin on each side but wouldn't leave much walking room.  I found the best configuration was perpendicular to the door in the corner (picture w/ the light visible) versus parallel to the door (felt a little cramped; 2nd photo).With the queen in place there was easily enough room to talk in, you could store bags/suitcases, and have a place to put your shoes.  There is even a hook to hang a light/fan and some storage on the walls/ceiling area.There are some cheap metal stakes  to stake the corners.  Some of the tents I've had included a tarp mat to put dirty shoes on that this didn't have.  It also didn't have a spot (that I noticed) to run a power cord.  Also doesn't come with a separate rain fly for the top but can be ordered separately (less than $20) if desired.  I ordered one just in case.Overall, happy with the purchase and quality/

  I recently got this tent because i was going on a solo mom and son camping trip, meaning no backup help if i couldn’t get our normal tent up by myself. This tent was so easy to put up, just extend the legs. Staking it down took the longest! First time not dreading setting it up again to clean and air it out. Might use it inside during the winter for my son!It ended up being a windy rainy weekend, and everything stayed dry for the most part (except the stuff touching the walls which was a “duh” moment for me ). However there was another site in our campground that did not have the rainfly and they had to tarp it down. So if you spend the extra $30 for the rain fly it’s a great tent !

Also I went camping with my three-year-old daughter and was worried about her getting out at night.  I figured I would zip the tent clothes and leave the zippers at the top so she couldn’t reach .  Unfortunately the tent only zips in one direction and the zippers have to be at the bottom . Also there’s a small gap where the two zippers meet and I found multiple spiders in my tent .I like how fast the set up was in doing it by myself was easy but for the size of the tent when it’s folded it still pretty large in comparison to other larger tent that collapse into a smaller size than the sta I like how fast the set up was and doing it by myself was easy but for the size of the tent when it’s folded it’s still pretty large in comparison to other larger tents that collapse into a smaller size than this tent.

Two people and gear would fit fine.  I would not want to try to sleep 4 in it unless some were tiny and also well-loved.  Good ventilation.  Good view from inside.  Sturdy even without guy wires. Good quality fabric.  Waterproof, tarp-like floor.  I used the rain-fly, purchased separately, and it was also very easy to put up and take down.  Have not experienced a rainstorm in it, but did camp in extremely humid East Texas swamp conditions, and there was condensation dripping from the top of the fly and none at all on the inside of the tent.  Door easy to get in and out of.  Handy pocket for things like cell phone, glasses, keys, flashlight; and a useful loop at the top to hang a lantern from.  The zippers worked easily.  Looking forward to more car-camping, with (just one) buddy, in this tent.

  Pro: This tent is super easy and quick to set up, like a minute!Cons: all of your stuff and you will be soaked if there is ANY rain!! Just awful! I even sealed the seams and it still leaked, I think through the windows that were zipped closed. I went from a 2 person Northface to this so tent for “car camping” and it’s awful!!  My Northface, never sealed, never let any water into the tent and it’s been in the mountains and car camping by the beach.  Very disappointed with the quality; rain should NOT enter your tent leaving several inches of water on the floor. Don’t waste your money if you camp with a chance of rain.  Wish I could return this, too bad I never tested it until recently.

    Best tent ever, but it leaks.
  
",3.0,Dusty K.,"Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2016","









  
  
    
  I bought this tent with full faith in the Coleman brand. There were some negative reviews, but I disregarded them. I bought this tent for a trip to Hocking Hills with my girlfriend, as well as the proper rainfly, which is not the 4 person rainfly they suggest. Along with the tent and rainfall I bought seam sealer and two cans of camp dry. The tent is extremely well designed and tall enough to stand and move in. All the internal seams have some sort of tape sealant on it so you won't need seam sealer. The zipper is flawless and is usually a 1 handed operation. I set the tent up for a trial run and sprayed it with both cans of camp dry for good measure. It rained at home and I went out to find water inside the next day. I really wasn't that concerned because I didn't have the rain fly on it and I figured it was necessary as some of the reviews said.It rained our first night at HH, for several hours, but slow enough that I could count the raindrops hitting the top. Rain began seeping in through the CLOSED window flaps, and only the window flaps, and grew worse the more it rained. It eventually escalated into steady drips all throughout the tent and standing water. I'm extremely dissatisfied as this is not a cheap tent. I have a feeling my tent my be a ""one-off"" bad quality, based on all the other good reviews. If it was waterproof I'd give it 6 stars, but mine was not.Other stuff:Can be assembled by one confident camper in a literal minute. Tied down in under 5.One of the plastic feet in the 4 corners that holds the loop for the stakes broke on 1st use. I was not being rough on the tent. It's just a shortcut in material quality, the rest of the tent and components seem great.Fits in bag without wrestling and even had extra room for a tarp in the bag. BUT the bag is huge. As a result of the quick and easy setup it doesn't break down very small. Probably 4.5"" tall and 9-10"" tall/wide. It's a knee banger if you don't wear it like a backpack.I'll be contacting Coleman to see if I can get some resolution on the tents quality.Update 2/12/20:Coleman replaced the tent free of charge with a larger 6 person tent. We have been using that tent for us and our two dogs for a few years now and it performs flawlessly. Faith restored in the Coleman brand!

  Honestly I wasn't expecting the quality of this tent, especially after hours of research, seeing 6 person tents in the 300-400 dollar range.The only con I can find with it, is it's size and weight.  Due to the robust attached pole system (the trade-off of having an ""instant tent"").  Maybe it could be pitched in 60 seconds with a couple helpers, but to carefully unpack and put it up took me about 10 minutes alone.The build quality is impressive.  Thick walls and thicker floor tub.  Zippers are neatly covered, the roof vents velcro into place and have ample coverage overlap from the mesh.  I love the side pocket and lantern hook from the ceiling, it feels sturdy.I don't plan to test it's waterproofness until I generously seal the seams with quality sealer (I plan to use Gear Aid seam grip and kiwi spray).  I waited till the last minute to order before my trip this weekend.  I brought a properly sized tarp which I plan to lay over and guy-line out if rain turns up in the forecast.Breaking it down was a lot harder than putting it up, as it takes some elbow grease to get this monster back in it's carrying case, but it was manageable.The most notable factor though was I left the windows all zipped up, and I literally could not break the tent down until I unzipped the entire door... the air was trapped inside.  This tells me the tent will hold heat from a buddy heater pretty well, and keep the wind out.  I wanted a tent that could be sealed up as much as possible for heat retention, and it seems like this will fit the bill.Warm weather shouldn't be an issue as all four large side windows zip down and the roof vents will let warm air escape.I'll update if I'm wrong about anything, but on first inspection this looks to be perfect for my needs.

  I am a 61 yr old male and last time I camp in a tent was at least 30-35 years ago. I hated it because it was almost like building a little cottage with pulling, pushing, yanking, stretching materials. Especially during summer those pipes were getting like fire after a while under the direct sunlight and burn our hands while constructing our masterpiece(!). Yet at the end it never looked like the ones you see in the brochures. You know, all stretched out perfectly without any wrinkle on it etc.,Anyways, then lately my wife and I decided to try tent camping again because we saw this specific tent and read about how easy it was to setup. So, give it a shot!Long behold,WOW!!! They were correct! Why nobody thought this years and years ago and made my life easier while I was younger.It literally took about 60-90 seconds to put it up, including the stretch it with stakes and all. Great Tent!!!Take down was even much faster than that. Probably 30-45 secondsNow, I see at some reviews people talking about internal conditions related to waterproofing, temperature control etc...We are a good weather campers. I check the forecast before I go to camping trip. If there is a tornado warning, heavy rain storm forecast or similar conditions WE DO NOT go camping in a tent, nor we are climbing to Himalayas with sherpas in tow. My only experience that we've had a strong 15-20 mph wind one night with gusts to 25mph and tent stood up very well in that conditions and we were very comfortable inside.To sleep on, we used a self inflating twin airbed which becomes 18 inch high off the ground and my wife and I and our 17 lbs Maltipoo were happy in the tent with lots of rooms for other camping gear too.We have 4 person size and it is plenty of room if you are 1 or 2 people camping in it. For a family of 3, even with a young child I recommend 6 person version of this tent.But if you are 1 or 2 adults camping this is a PERFECT tent.

  I love this tent. Practice at home before the trip, just so you know the mechanics.I've taken it camping three times, and it's been super easy to set up. I am usually the first one done, helping everyone else with their tents. I'm petite. It takes me less than 5 minutes to set up with a tarp underneath. Taking it down requires maybe 5-10 minutes just because you have to really decompress it to fit back into the bag.I mainly camp on the beach, so I purchased extra long stakes. I didn't buy the rain fly for this, and it's been fine with humidity.On one of the trips, there was an unexpected thunderstorm with 20mph winds, which lasted about 6-7 hours. I had no extra rain fly, and had not treated the tent with water repellant beforehand. Water started seeping into the corners of the tent after 4 or 5 hours, which I blotted with towels. But I mostly stayed dry. My family's tents were completely soaked that night. My tent also held up against the winds. Overall I felt that this tent did well on its own under extreme weather, without an extra rain fly or water repellent.I don't know how durable it is, since I've only had it for a year and three trips. But it does seem to be a great buy.

   I was excited about this new tent and initially, it seemed great! It went up in a matter of minutes and was nice and spacious. After the first night I realized that the placement of the zippers on the windows and the “door” seemed fairly impractical, but I could overlook it. Then came the rain. The first night it stormed, I didn’t have an additional rain fly, as it seemed unnecessary, based on the video about the tents resistance to wind and rain. The tent was leaking through the zippers, the corners filled up with water, and rain was dripping through the material itself. The next day, I woke up in a drenched tent and decided to put an additional tarp over the tent, making it difficult for air and light to get in, but I figured, at least, it would be dry. It rained a second  night, and managed to fill the tent with water, again. It didn’t “ruin my trip” or anything, but for lack of a better phrase, it sucked super bad.

It was windy this last trip and i could see the hinged tent legs moving and flexing with the wind. This seems to be a good design. Two person maximum for this size.

  I've delayed a review, as I wanted to put the tent through it's paces... it's been a year now... Here's the report...It's is argument free setup... it's quick and easy to setup. lots of head room and good ventilation (albeit, in the desert, it gets hot no matter what you do... but it also gets really cold at night; the tent does well in both extremes... here are some details (more than most will want to read)...I have some seam covering that is breaking loose in the corners at the top of the tent... Not sure how I will repair it, but I'm certain without the rain fly, it will now leak. though it hasn't leaked in the past... new seam tape will be necessary; and you have to make certain you understand how the zippers at the bottom need to be positioned to keep the water 100% out... so pay attention to the details of that little corner fabric, its there to keep the drips out...that said... It hasn't been rigorously put to a rain test... most of our camping is desert camping or high desert so not much to report. We've stayed dry in the very light rain, with the rain-fly attached.Now WIND... we just returned from Death Valley. Wind speeds reported at 25 mph (gusts 30) (seemed like much more than that when you're in a tent)...I had the tent staked down on the flooring using larger spikes than what comes with the tent (the tent pegs that come with it seem small to me). I also used the guy lines that attach to the tent canvas; here's where I think Coleman needs to rethink on the design. With the large gusts of wind, the tent poles were giving way and threatening to bend inward. The wind we faced came directly at us; that is full on the front door...(the wind was out of the south the day we setup camp; 2 days later it was out of the north). There's a top ""knuckle"" where the tent pole bends from the roof line down the extended legs... When the winds picked up and the front started to bend inward, I grab paracord and tied off above the ""knuckle"" and tied down from there with two guy lines on each of the wind facing front tent poles. This provided support on the tent pole directly. I used a steep angle on the guy lines directly into the wind; mostly out of necessity as I had an ""easy-up"" in front of the tent for shade (it required a number of new guy lines to take on the wind as well).  With the gusts, I half expected the tent poles to bend... but they stood strong.  It was a bit nerve racking... and we did loose a small 3 man Coleman tent that was for my 10 year old... he's a bit upset that his tent blew away... but that small tent only had tent pegs holding it down (no guy lines)... unfortunately it didn't hold up well. But this 6 man tent, with the extra guy lines held up well after a year of abuse at Joshua Tree, Jackson Flat and a few other places in between... it did very well.If faced with winds like that again, I'll tie down as I did this time... just above that ""knuckle.""  I've thought about making my own modification; but I don't want to weaken the tent poles in any way... the paracord did fine, it's both strong and flexible enough to provide the extra support.  Maybe the only new thing to add to the kit is stronger (and longer) tent pegs/stakes. (I really wanted 18 to 20 inch Rebar stakes)...To reinforce the need to use guy lines... this Death Valley trip was part of a Cub Scout group event... There were others with similar tents; however, they did not use guy lines (the reason given was 'the kids trip over them and the parents do as well')... they just used the included pegs at the bottom corners... Those tents did not survive the wind. The instant tents gave way under the strong winds (breaking at the hinge points) a few families ended up sleeping in their cars... a few others only tied down on the tabs on their canvas... those that didn't add guy lines to the tent poles, all bent... Some less than others... but there are more than a few that will be looking to buy new tents for the season. Sadly a few campers had a lot of money invested in their tents; but they didn't setup properly... if you're one that doesn't like to use the guy lines... I strongly suggest re-thinking... if you add a pool noodle that you can slip over the guy line, they become more visible and you're less likely to trip on them... trust me... I get it... I've tripped and fallen on a guy line in the dark because my headlamp went out... but guy lines saved my family from having to sleep in the truck. And the tent poles on this tent were strong enough to hold up to the winds of Death Valley at Furnace Creek... :-)

Fine, I can stitch it up when I get home. For now, a piece of duct tape will work.Head out of camp for the day and a storm rolls in. I’ve got my rain gear on and my brand new Coleman tent with “WeatherTech” waiting to welcome me when I get back. Except, when I open the door, I see water. Just a little puddle, so I figure it’s from the seam I duct taped. I clean it up with a rag and get ready for bed. Lay down on my sleeping pad and squish! Out comes the rest of the gallon of water that had leaked into the tent.Still I can handle this, the op of the pad and my sleeping bag are dry so I scoop out as much water as possible, mop up the rest with a rag, and lay down to get some sleep. Only problem is it starts raining again and soon I feel a drop on my face. And another on the outside of my bag. Then another on my arm, and pretty soon IT’S RAINING INSIDE OF THE DAMN TENT!!!Returned and NEVER purchasing another Coleman tent!!

  Ok so this tent has now been tried and tested on a few camping trips and I must say this is by far the sturdiest pop up tent I’ve ever owned. It really is very quick to setup and take down. Haven’t tested it yet on really heavy rain but it did get sprayed on and seams held up even before I put seam sealer. Plenty of room inside. We put a queen size air mattress in and you could still fit at least another queen air mattress and heaps of camping gear. The quick install is the best part. Specially when you have limited daylight left, you don’t waste time setting up. First time setting it up was actually pitch black and even then it was a breeze. Highly recommend this tent. I might actually get another one as a spare. Oh and it stays pretty cool in the SoCal summer heat too, plenty of ventilation. And even high winds it stays durable. Very impressed.

  Wonderfully easy to set up, durable floor (camped on a gravel bar), good airflow with the windows down, very comfortable with a queen air mattress and some room on the sides...But holy cow, the zippers SUCK! They like to get snagged and not clasp, forcing you to yank on them until you can get them all the way unzipped and gently and carefully zip them up again. My tent was fully staked out with the ""optional"" rainfly to provide adequate tension, and the window zippers on the sides particularly were a problem when an unexpected thunderstorm rolled through. I ran back to the tent to close the side windows (because the $30 dollar rainfly doesn't even prevent rain from hitting the windows) and I spent about 15 minutes getting smacked with rain in the face because the zipper on my brand new tent decided to stop zipping together for a moment and instead leave a large open zipper behind it. I ended up throwing a tarp over the tent while I worked on the zipper because I didn't feel like getting my bedding and clothes soaked.

  My girlfriend and I recently took this tent out for two nights in Atlatl Rock Campground in Valley of Fire and it performed flawlessly. We used it with the Coleman Queen sized camping cot with inflatable mattress. It was easy to setup and break down, however we did struggle to zip up the bag after it was packed.I do want to address the waterproof aspects. In the morning on our second day it rained for 2-3 hours with light to moderate rainfall. It could be 3 hours because the rain started while we were still asleep. I am happy to report that the interior was bone dry for us. I can't speak for everyone else but using the rainfly that we had to purchase separately we had zero issues with the rain. Although it was loud, it handled heavy winds which we experienced on our second night and the rainfly also remained secure the entire time.

  The Coleman 6 person tent. I like this tent I got a lot of complements on it  while camping in Moab Ut. Over the  memorial day weekend 2017. Easy to set up I didn't have a  reserved camping spot and it was kinda of a last minute trip. My son and I found a  primitive camping spot late in the day and the sun was starting to set never even pulled out of the box before set up and it was getting dark. My 10 year old who never been tent camping before helped and we got it up  literally from the box on the ground and set up in 3 minutes not counting the Guide ropes. It  would've probably been faster if I just did it myself but my son wanted to help and I showing him how the poles lock in place.  There are some bad things with this tent the zipper pull tab on the front window broke  first time use the window was open when I set it up and I was closing it and the tab fell right off but the zipper still works so I was like that sucks. All of the other zipper pulls looked ok and haven't broke yet. Also I can see in the other reviews that it leaked well I didn't have any rain there but I can see small holes in the seams of the  four large side panels  attach to one another  probably when they sewed the panels together I can light come through so some seam  sealer is order. So I gave it three stars I can over look something's and I can deal with it but some people can't and I can see why you pay for something and you want it to last. I'm going camping again at the end of June 2017 Buena Vista Colorado  I will add to this if I have any problems with it.Pros:Easy set up (fast)Lots of space in side and I can stand up in it I'm 6'1""Big windows that zip cooled it downPacking up was also fast all fit back in its bagThe WTF :/Zipper pull broke off first pullI can see some pin holes of light in the  four main sections of the tent where Sewed togetherUpdate:took it out again for a camping trip up to Buena Vista Co. for 4x4 event there.The first night we didn't have any rain but I had heavy condensation inside the tent and it was dripping a little but i felt that it was my fault because I didn't leave the two top vents open at night. The next night I did and was dry as a bone in there.Also when out on the trail we came back to a camp site that was hit by heavy winds my chairs and table where blown all around and some other peoples tent got wrecked But this tent did stand up and take it with no problems at all and we didn't have any trees helping to block the wind we were on a flat field. So I was happy about that (side note I did have heavy duty stakes at 4 main corners of the tent but i used the one that come with it on the other places all held down.

  I bought the 4 person for under $100 and think it’s incredible for that price. I did return it because I think I want the 6 person tent just to have some extra room. I was able to build it in my kitchen, super easy, good Coleman quality. I also bought the rain fly which is sold separately and found highly recommended by other reviews.Overall, it fit my ultra high large queen blow up mattress with room around the edges to walk a bit. And there was a good entryway to leave some bags. I don’t think you could fit a table or another sleep bag in there with the queen bed though. I want some extra space for my dogs crate which is why I think I’ll buy bigger. Also, I didn’t like that I couldn’t stand up in the middle of the 4 person which made me feel clausterphobic. I know a lot of tents are like this so it’s just my preference. Upon more research I saw the review I had been looking at was talking about the 6 person tent which apparently goes to 6 feet high in the middle which I could have been able to stand up in. So overall - quick, easy, good quality, decent price.

    Great tent, works as advertised ... but plan on buying a new storage bag
  
",4.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2016","









  
  
    
  First, let's get the bad out of the way. The storage bag is too small, even by tent standards. I ended up damaging the zipper trying to stuff the tent back into the bag the first time I used it. And as I've found out, the bag is not covered under the warranty. So just go ahead and budget $20-$50 for a jumbo duffel bag if you buy this tent.Setup was just as easy as advertised. The mechanism is similar to a pack and play. I was easily able to do the basic setup in a couple of minutes by myself. There are four cords you can extend and stake to the ground, but I didn't bother. I don't think you need them except maybe in windy conditions.The rain fly is not included but can be purchased separately. A thunderstorm rolled in before I had a chance to deploy the rain fly, so I was forced to put the tent's integrated rain fly to the test. After 30 minutes of heavy rain, and several hours of on-and-off light rain, the contents of the tent were dry. In the morning I did notice some water pooled near the door, but I think that was just from opening/closing the door several times while it was raining.Take down is a little less intuitive, but also easy (except for the bag being too small).We had one adult and two grade school kids this trip, along with a luggage and other gear. I think you could reasonably fit two adults and two kids as long as the adults were sharing a mattress. I wouldn't recommend more than that.Overall I'm happy with the tent and plan to keep using it. It is much easier to setup/tear down than my other traditional tents.

  I purchased this tent at the last minute for a camping trip with my mom.  I got the 6 person tent and my son bought the 10 person black out tent.  Both tents were fantastic. I had read a couple of reviews that said it didn't work so I was a little nervous especially since we rolled into camp with about an hour of sunset light left and we were at least two hours away from any major shopping.These tents are fantastic!  They can be set up with one person but it is easier with two and takes no more than a minute or two.  I didn't even need to put the stakes into mine once I threw all of our equipment into it.  The six person tent is perfect for two people.  LOL  As most tents go, we know 6 person tent means if they are all laying side by side in sleeping bags only with no extra room for bags or anything.The ten person tent is very room and was perfect for my son, his fiance and their large dog.  You can stand up in both tents.  The ten person comes with a rain fly but for the 6 person it has to be ordered separately.It was very windy the first night and the wind did not blow thru the tent at all.The only downside to these tents is that they are fairly difficult to fold and get back into the bag.  I can't imagine one person doing this.  Unless there is a learning curve and it will get better with practice.  Because the tent is all one piece everything tends to bunch up at one end and it took a lot of stuffing, cursing, cajoling and teamwork to reach a point where the tent was inside the bag with the zipper closed.

  I needed a tent that I could actually stand up straight in and change clothes, yet has the smallest possible footprint as I bunk alone with my large, oversize cot. This fit the bill.  First weekend out? Yep, it rained...and I also purchased the optional rain fly. Not only did it hold in the heat well from my portable heater, but it also kept me dry. No leaks, no problems and I was able to set this up and take it down solo.  We always rake up the tent area and always lay down an extra tarp under the tent for added protection from punctures.  I can't recommend this tent enough. 6 people? Well, not sure about all that, but I would say you could comfortably sleep 2 adults.

  We bought this one to replace our aging dome tent.  We got it and right out of the box (without any instructions) we were able to have this set up within a minute or so.  Super easy to get set up.  We planned on letting it air out and then I was going to give it a sprinkler test for water.  Mother Nature tested it for me.This tent is very light.  Make sure you stake it down. The wind was able to blow it around quite easily.  As for the rain, it did get a little water in it, but that was primarily because I wasn't ready for the rain.  The windows were down and the vent on top was open.  I closed them all up and it rained again and we didn't have any issues.  The seams were dry, the door was easy to open and close.  I did put the rain fly (bought separately) AFTER my test and it was even better.  Zero rain and water in the tent even with the driving wind at about 15 mph.Very satisfied and happy with the tent.  I am still going to wax the seams just to be extra safe but it wasn't needed right out of the box.

  These Coleman Instant Setup cabin tents are a godsend for speed and ease of use!  Simply invert legs to the sides, lift the middle, then start extending the leg extensions, adjusting the tent as necessary.  I can set the 4-person up by myself in 2-3 minutes (not counting staking).  I can set the 6-person up by myself in about 3-4 minutes (not counting staking).  The problem with being done so quickly is that you end up having to help all the annoying people who brought pole-tents.The tent offers great cover and lots of space.  It's relatively tall inside (the 6-person feels taller than the 4-person).  The zippers work great.  I never use windows in my tents so I can't say much about those, but they work if you want to use them.Now the bad - I've seam-sealed and water-proofed both my 6-person and my 4-person, and both leak in rain.  The leaks are fairly isolated to the windows, likely because the windows are poorly designed.  The screen of the windows is on the outside, and there's like a pocket/gap under the screen where the window connects to the rest of the material of the tent.  The water seems to have no where to go but either sit there or drip inside.  Definitely look into that rainfly accessory, it'll help stop water from dripping into those window pockets.Despite the leaks, I highly recommend this tent if you're a weekend camper looking to put up tents near your car.  Absolutely worth every penny and more.

  I bought one of these in 2015, so far very little leakage in the rain. I bought another one in 2016. The first had a dark gray floor, the newer one has a light gray floor, a couple other design changes, but basically the same tent. Took the newer one camping, rained a little, leaked from the top a little. Bought a rain canopy. Second trip, rained a lot, leaked more than a lot. You could actually watch rain almost go directly through the walls, like they were never treated with whatever waterproofing they use. Half the trip was spent trying to empty the giant puddles that formed every time it rained a little. The canopy kept the top from leaking, but the walls were about as waterproof as mesh. I like the setup, but what happened? My kid was using the tent, slept in the truck rather than deal with the flood.

  We bought this product four our yearly vacation the first night it stormed the tent leaked in the seams near the tarp bottom so our entire trip was wet from there on out. I also realized assembly was poorly executed when the top tent pole mounts were not sewn in symmetrically creating spots that pulled on the ten harder in some spots then others pulling at the seems excessively. Finally this door setup i was originally thrilled with has many functional issues including the flaps constantly getting caught in the zippers. the zipper pulls are so short they are difficult to see and find in the daylight much less in the dark during a situation.  do not open these doors quickly if you are trying to exit the tent quickly. Period they are terrible. The other entryway into the tent worked reasonably well. Sadly the rain fly is lacking and they geometry of the windows and rain protection make for a stuffy rainy day. Better than the original instant set up tent with no rain fly however still not pleasant. A simple option  like some overhangs  in the center of the rain fly would allow for ventilation with open windows.All in all Coleman quality has gone downhill dramatically since my previous purchases going back to my youth were you had Coleman you had quality.

  I'm liking this tent. I was able to set it up the first time in about 90 seconds, alone. It comes with the necessary metal stakes and has guy line attached to the tent for taking as well. As with ANY tent, you'd be best served by buying some seam sealer and covering every seam, top and bottom. I used about 2 bottles for this tent. Also, if you want to stay dry, make certain you purchase the optional tent fly and seam those seams as well. If you buy the fly (and you should), make certain you get a tent kit with it as you will need an additional 4 stakes.  A rubber-headed mallet also comes with the tent kit which makes driving the stakes into hard ground easy. It also has a tent dustpan & broom and a stake puller, a handy tool. Again, as with any tent, you will want a ground cloth. I used a 9""x12"" plastic tarp that I cut to size, and it worked fine. Without a ground cloth, water will likely seep into the tent during a heavy downpour.Keep in mind this is a relatively fair-weather tent. Dome tents usually have three sets of sleeved rods to help stabilize them in strong winds which can often occur in thunder storms. With only two sets of rods (integral with the tent), this likely would not sustain a good storm. It's profile is such that it would likely not do well in a heavy rain with winds of 20-30 mph or more. A similar sized dome tent (at much more expense) with a lower, more rounded profile, would do much better. Keep this in mind before you purchase.The tent has a plastic hanger on the inside roof for a light, but for safety-sake, employ a carabiner or velcro loop if using a candle lantern. I was using a battery lantern that weighs almost 3 pounds with no issue, two battery lighting is recommended. I gave this tent 4 stars because although it is as good as any Coleman or Eureka tent I've owned, it has only two mesh storage pockets. For a tent this size (6-person), it should have 5 or 6; two on each wall and another one or two the back wall. Lord knows, there is room for them. On the overall, I would recommend this item for the price. As well, the door zipper needs some coaxing to get around the curve at the upper right of the door. It just doesn't ""zip"" as easily as other tents I have had.

  I have had this tent over a year and put it to use mostly in the summers of the Pacific Northwest. Mostly in dry weather. Recently used it in a downpour. Here are my impressions.Pros: Large ten with lots of room. Good height for standing up in.  Stays totally dark when closed up. Stays dry in very light and short doses of rain. Doors at both ends allow for easy access. Set up fairly easy.Cons: Super heavy and really needs 2 people to set up quickly and efficiently. Walls stick out beyond rainfly. Totally useless in anything but lights scattered rain. The only thing remotely water proof is the floor. Water seeps in from the walls and pools in vast quantities.If you live in a sunny warm dry place this is a good family or festival tent.

  I can't emphasize just how easy this was to set up! Didn't read the directions and not a regular camper. My wife and I had this set up in about a minute, literally! Plenty of windows and ventilation. Roomy for two...we had two oversized cots and that was about all we could have in there and still move around some. It's not really a 6 person tent unless the persons are small kids and they only have sleeping bags.The height is good. Only around the edges was there any height issue, but again, we were limited in moving around because of the two oversized cots.The only drawback on this otherwise awesome tent is the zipper for the front door. Zipping around the rounded corner was a bit of a pain in the arse! In the middle of the night when you have to go answer the call of nature, it was annoying as all get out when the zipper wouldn't move around the rounded corner of the door easily. It was like that all the time no matter how anxious we were to get out.Also, keep in mind there is no rain hood included, but there is a cover over the ceiling vents just in case it rains. I wouldn't want to leave the windows open if it rained, without a rain hood, so you'd probably want to get one or take the chance. If you close the windows during the rain you'll stay dry from the rain, but it'll get kind of stuffy in there.Also, it doesn't get put away quite as easily as it was put up, but it was pretty straightforward once we paid attention! lol! It took about 5 minutes to get it packed away neatly. Still, that's nothing! I suspect the second time we use it, it will be about two minutes to pack it up!We love how easy it was to set up and how awesome it was! However, if you are a camper who uses an air mattress or cot and likes to have stuff in your tent, this is more like a good sized tent for two grown adults (if you value space), not for up to 6 as it advertises.Overall, this exceeded our expectations and we would recommend it to others to use, whether novice or seasoned campers.

  I really wanted to like this tent. It's roomy, and super easy to set up. There were some white spots on it that made me wonder if it was a repack instead of brand new, but I couldn't be sure so I set it up to test it. I'm typing this right now wearing jeans that are soaked through at the knees. They are soaked through because when I went out to disassemble the tent, I found that it was FILLED with water. It rained last night so I thought maybe water got in through the roof vent, but my air mattress and sleeping bag were dry so the water could not have dripped down from above--it must have come in through the seams. When I say filled with water, I mean it took me an entire brand new roll of paper towels to begin the drying out process. After I had gone through an entire roll I decided to not kill any more trees, and decided to use a bath towel to mop up the rest. It is now sitting open on a sunny, windy day to ensure that the inside is completely dry before I ship it back. To make matters worse, I bought and installed the optional rainfly. It did absolutely nothing.

Anyone who can carry it would have no problem setting it up by themselves in practically no time.Once seam-sealed, the tent by itself is waterproof enough for a typical afternoon thunderstorm.  For prolonged rain, you WILL need the rain fly.When fully staked out, it does a fine job of standing up to wind.The 'meh':It is heavy, and is quite bulky when packed up.The top vents did a reasonable job of preventing condensation, never had problems with droplets landing on us.

Its definitely not waterproof but like most tents you should go out and buy the spray waterproofing sealant and give it a blast especially around the seams areas, that's what we did. For the most part the tent was dry except around the stitching areas was leaking but it was so small it was not a big deal. But yes the black room technology is amazing and it kept the tent cooler than expected. The rainfly did come with this 10 person instant cabin popup tent which was also awesome. I just wished I would of gotten a new tent for what I paid for which was supposed to be new!! But even with that being said I'm still happy with this tent

  1.) Heavy not super heavy but this thing is a beast.2.) Awkward spider leg poles like to move on you so don’t set it up alone like I did. Unless you can stay vigilant on its movements.3.) be delicate looks like this will last a long time but the connector at the top of the tent is made out of hard plastic, the kind that breaks if abused or twisted too fast(see number 2).Other than that solid tent I wish the color was different I’m not a person for bright colors hence the purchase of a a BLACKOUT tent lol but whatever sleeping in on a cold morning is going to be heavenly.

  Everyone we camped with was jealous of this tent. We slept hours past everyone because of the darkness.It is easy to set up but it is heavy and I had a hard time lifting it in and out of the car.We used the flap door but it didn’t close completely and usually had a gap at the top. And when we didn’t have it zipped and just used the flap door the tent did get water in it through that door.Still happy with the tent!

I can get my cot, a chair, 2-3 tables to hold my coffee pot, crock pot, lamps, and laptop.  With room left over for a potty when I’m wild camping.The door zipper on my last tent lost several teeth when I got it stuck on my jacket last fall in the LBL while camped at Hillman Ferry campground.Finally got tired of clothes pinning the door shut and discovered buying a new tent was cheaper than getting a new zipper put in one.

Along with the rainfly, I was able to stay nice and dry during the rains. Plus, my tent stayed upright and in place during very violent winds on more than one occasion. While everyone's tents and structures went flying by, this one shook and had winds blowing all around it, but it stayed firmly in place, even in the craziest  60 mph winds. I was so scared, but I didn't need to be because my tent stayed in place. I was very happily surprised. Thank you, and I would definitely recommend this tent to anyone! :)

  Took a few tries to get one that was defect free. Had some zipper problems.Have only used it for one 3-day camping trip to a NFS hosted campground in NC. No rain or bad weather at all, so I can't comment on that. It did great and really does setup in under a minute. Maybe a bit longer if you worry about staking it down and how hard the ground is.Now that I'm old, I treated myself to a self inflating 18"" high twin mattress.  With this mattress and my stuff there was still plenty of room to move around.  With 2 mattresses or a queen sized one there would have been no room for ""stuff"". If my wife had come we would have needed the 6-Person model. We are into comfort after years of suffering when we camped with the kids. I can't believe I used to blow up a queen sized air mattress by just blowing!I thought I saw someone say it was suitable for backpacking. NOT! It is heavy and bulky.  It takes way more than a minute to take it down and get it back in the carrying bag.  The bag does have an expansion option that would make packing easier, but I haven't cut it open yet to maintain the smallest traveling package possible.

  Unfortunately, Coleman's quality control seems as leaky as their tents. We set up our tent and rain-fly on a rainy day... left to get a bigger tarp in preparation for the coming storm, and came back to a swimming pool inside our tent (before the storm arrived).More rain came in through the night (though this time it was due to our mattress touching the tent wall).Further testing with a garden hose once home showed water seeping through the tent walls (30 second water spray).On a positive note: this tent is very easy to set up and take down. One person can have this tent up in a minute. Take down takes slightly longer to get everything packed right, but it will fit back in the original bag. You can also expand the bag if you don't want to be too tidy.Inside it is spacious and can potentially fit two queen mattresses, though they will be tight against tue side walls which may cause further leaking. Even with two queens, there's still extra space for your shoes and gear, and two small pockets for flashlights, phones, etc.Unlike similar tents, this model does not include an opening for an extension cord. Rain fly must be bought separately as well.I returned my tent and fly due to the leaking.

  Just received my 6 person cabin tent..... I am very pleased with my purchase. Set up was easy by myself.  Took a little longer than 60 seconds but I admittedly I did not read directions and just jumped in.  It was VERY quick to go up compared to my 23 year old 3 person Coleman Dome Tent which is still in great shape.  Had it not been for the growing interest in camping from my two sons this purchase may not have happened.  Once set up I checked all seams, zippers, plastic connectors, mesh, Velcro, and everything in between to ensure there were no tears, breaks, missed stitches, or seals.... To my pleasure all was in order and the tent looks great! Can’t wait to use this as it is a significant upgrade.  I did purchase the rain fly because why wouldn’t you! I do agree it should be included just add it to the pricepoint.  I’m hoping I have the same luck I’ve had with my current Coleman tent as far as quality.

  The tent was delivered.  I said to my wife- Oh!  The tent is in! Let's set it up (here in the living room) she was confused and thought that perhaps I had lost my mind.  But NOOOOOO.  30 seconds later, the tent was set up in the living room.  She was dumbfounded and SUPER excited to go camping this weekend with the newfound freedom of simple camp set-up.I do have one struggle with the tent, thought it's NOT the tent's fault at all.  I also ordered 2 Coleman ComfortSmart Deluxe Cots.  Unfortunately, the cots are juuuuuust a bit too long to fit in the tent.  We managed, but it was a pain in the booty.  So I'm probably going to return the tent and get a 6-person tent.Oh, as is the case with all tents- rating something as 4 person, means it's about OK for 2 people. Tent makers are very standardized in this area. DO NOT expect to sleep 4 people in this tent, unless you think 4 people sleeping in a King sized bed is normal and comfortable.  (If you do, well hey- congrats!)The stakes included with the tent aren't really necessary, but they are also garbage which is again standard with all tents. Throw them out and go to Home depot and buy some 12"" nails for cheap and durable tent stakes.

  We aren't campers so maybe this is obvious to other people but the morning dew (and I assume rain) will soak through and wet anything touching the sides of the tent. Basically, you and your belongings are dry as long as they aren't touching the tent material. My husband took the kids camping and my daughter rolled against the side of the tent in the middle of the night and woke up with a cold, wet sleeping bag. She was not a happy camper (ha! see what I did there?) It's also a tight squeeze (plenty of room for 2 small kids and an adult (6'2"") but not so much room when you bring your bags inside (they had 2 small duffel bags). Not a big deal for except the bags have to be up against the side of the tent to make room for people and so... you guessed it!... their bags were damp in the morning.

Also bought the rain fly, which is not included.  I had no trouble with leaks, but the condensation does build up on the inside as others have stated, even with opening the top roof vent and leaving the windows open slightly at night.  Over all, this tent is good, but I would not use it for anything more rugged than state or national park campgrounds.  Definitely not for backpacking...too heavy.  Also walls are nylon parachute type material, so probably not for cold weather camping.

The video says their rain testing this was bone dry. Thats either false advertising or this item is defective! Not only did water seep through the fabric but also there are tiny holes in it everywhere it looks like the needle went the wrong way when they sewed it together and they just left it. (See the pics) for the price this is very unacceptable! If it says waterproof we should not wake up in puddles of water! I used the rainfly and that also didn't fit well and the clip broke right away. Is Coleman getting to be a low quality brand? It seems like it from my experience! I need a replacement or refund. Very disappointed!!! These pics show the floor and walls inside the tent the morning after it rained. Last pic shows how half of my pillow was soaked! If it was actually waterproof this would be an awesome tent as the size and height is great. And so easy to set up!

  This tent was a breeze to set up. I set it up previous to going camping and waterproofed, or so I thought, by sealing the seams and spraying the outside. First day, during a light rain it did well, but still leaked some around the windows. The next day, when it poured down rain, it poured in the tent. I am going to try waterproofing again, but have little faith it will work.A lot of money for a fair weather tent.

  Friend strongly recommend this Coleman 6-Person Instant Cabin tent do to ease of setup, break down, and roominess, and he was correct. This is the easiest medium size tent I have ever set up by myself. Pole system is designed for one-person setup. Extension poles lock in place, letting you walk from one side to the other extending the poles. Once poles are extended just pulled out sides and your done maybe 10 minutes or so. I had purchased tent pins but did not use them. Break down is very easy flowing.  Storing the tent in case is an art. Fits perfect with other camping gear in my ford flex. I had my service dog with me and one-fold out cot there was plenty of room for the both of us. Door access is wide and tall especially when you need to go out at night, widows are large and zip open and close neatly. Use it as a shelter in the day time with the windows open and a breeze it worked out great. For me there were no negative things I could think of. Oh, I was on San Onofre beach Marine Corp Base Camp Pendelton in California in February. There a heavy concentration of mist early in the morning I did not use a rain fly, but the tent held up great.

I never saw the tent again. This time, we set the tent up in about 2 minutes without the guidelines and we were quite pleased with the clear 3 step instructions.It was raining when we disassembled the tent. It literally took about 60 seconds to take it down and put it away properly.  I love that Coleman tents fit in their bags!So, why 4 stars? Well, the bottom of the tent already has a small tear in it and the tent has only been used once. Granted, maybe we should have put a tarp below it. Still, I think the flooring material must be weak to tear on the first use. The tent was on grass, not rocks.All in all, I would set up camp with this tent anytime.

  I bought this tent in April of 2017. I used it for camping over a long weekend in May of 2017. I thought it was pretty great. It goes up super easy. I bought the rain fly as well because sometimes we get some serious thunderstorms in Ohio.The tent without the fly seemed  pretty water tight over all. I could have possibly gotten away without a fly. It was roomy enough for myself and my campmate sharing a queen bed and having quite a bit of clothing and gear inside the tent.I camped in it again in October of the same year and then June 2018. When I was taking it down after the June 2018 trip one of the poles that's attached to the top of the ""instant up"" frame sheared off making it a not exactly cheap pile of trash.Because I camp at least twice a year I have already replaced this tent with a more traditional design tent, also from Coleman, that I hope will hold up better.I also have a Wenzel Klondike tent that I've had almost 3 years that is still usable.

  I upgraded from a tent I couldn't stand up in, to this.  A big improvement.  The one thing that this tent has which most don't, is that all the side windows have zipper panels that completely close off the screens.  This means that the dust of Burning Man won't come blowing in.I took away one star because for some foolish reason, the designers DIDN'T put a zipper panel that lets you close the two small vents in the top of the tent.  So you will get some dust in that way -- though you can also cover them with duct tape (or removable painter's tape) if you have to.This tent was not great at insulating me from the hot sun -- but a layer of shade cloth draped on poles above it worked wonders.I did not get rained on, so can't comment on whether it's waterproof.

  Our family went camping for the first time about a month ago.  I'm very partial to quick set up and break down, so after some research, I decided on this product for the 4 of us.I knew we had to get larger than a 4 person tent, as the person number estimate is never close to practical, and 6 person seemed to make sense.  In practical use, it was a bit small for the 4 of us, mattress pads, sleeping bags, and all of our other camping gear.  However, it might be hard to go with the 8 person model due to size (set up and stored) as well as the additional cost, so we were satisfied with the 6 person.make sure to purchase the rain fly that is sold separately, as this made a good difference for us.  It rained each of the two nights at camp, and the rain fly helped with the condensation on the top of the tent.  The sides had a fair amount of condensation, and if we didn't have the rain fly, it would've been unpleasant.

  This is a great tent for the price.  Easy to erect in 5 minutes or less.  Does not leak in the rain.  Keeps all the bugs out.  Well built.  A palace for one person.  Roomy  for 2 people...gets cozy with 3-4. Not a backpacking tent due to weight but great for car camping.  Windows on 3 sides.  Somewhat warm for summer camping and the breeze will not hit you at ground level due to elevated window level.  I use a fan in extreme summer. Taking it down and packing it takes a little longer but it does go back in the bag it comes in.I had to purchase a fly separately which is a must if you want to keep windows open while it is raining.  There is an option to purchase tent and fly together which is probably more economical.  Surprised I don't see this tent at any retail outlets.  I've used this tent on 6 campouts and at a week long summer camp and it performed admirably in all conditions.  The only thing missing is a vestibule.

    Tent is good, but rainfly combo is not sized correctly
  
",4.0,W. Walker,"Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2016","









  
  
    
  First off I ordered this along with the rainfly combo. The rainfly that came with the 6 person tent was for the 4 person cabin tent. I contacted Amazon and luckily they were able to send me the correct rainfly the same day at no cost. The rep couldn't understand why it was packaged with a 4 person rainfly either, so before you buy make sure it has been repackaged correctly - I don't think you can view it until you order it or at least put it in your cart.As for the tent itself, I camped with my 2 daughters in Monterey. It was super easy and quick to set up, and my 10 year old could do it by herself. The takedown is quick too. It takes more time trying to get the tent back into the bag (which I wish was just a little deeper) than to set up or take down. It was very damp the first night we camped with a thick marine layer. I wish the rainfly extended all the way to the ground because the insides do get quite a bit of moisture. The floor was dry, but the sides were wet. The second night it was not as foggy, but again the sides were very wet with moisture. On the plus side we had a lot of room for the 3 of us. I had a cot and the 2 girls slept on mats/sleeping bags. You could fit a full size blow up mattress in there instead, and I will likely get that for the future. Just keep your sleeping bags away from the walls if there's a lot of moisture outside or your bag will get wet. Plenty of standing room, and very roomy so overall we enjoyed the tent. The floor I hope holds up because it does seem like a stiff thin tarp. I always use a thicker tarp underneath the tent so that should help.

  I've been a prime customer with Amazon for the past 10yrs. And I have never written a bad review until now. Coleman should be ashamed of themselves. A tent should not leak at all. Yeah maybe one or two miner ones but The Coleman Cabin Tent with Instant Setup leaked at almost every seam. The tent arrived on March 13 2020 on a Friday. I set the tent up on Saturday and my daughter and I sleep in it over night ( good thing it didn't rain that night). I left it up so my daughter could play in it while on her spring break(so the plan was?). So its up Saturday thur Sunday. I go to work on Monday and it starts to rain. It rains heavy on and off for the whole day. To my surprise when I get home I find a small lake on the inside of the tent. Inflatable mattress, sleeping bags, tent mattress and table all soaked with water. At first I though there was a hole in the tent or that the windows where left down. That was not the case. It was leaking from ever seam in the tent. Ridiculous!!!! Same on COLEMAN... Planning to do some camping I purchased all kinds of accessories to go with this tent and not to mention the camping equipment that is now soaked with water in a ""WATERPROOF"" tent. This is by far the worst purchased ever. COLEMAN is misleading the customer with that video of quality control on their tents. The video shows a woman inspecting the inside of this tent checking for water intrusion after they simulate a rainstorm. BS..... That video is what convinced me to purchased this tent. It is now 4 days since the arrival of the tent and I've made arrangements to return it and all the accessories that I purchased for it. COLEMAN  is no longer a name you can trust. Buy beware!!!!!!! DON'T BUY THIS TENT. Would have been ZERO stars but Amazon will not allow it.

  I've used this tent a couple of times in the north Cascades. First of all, it sets up almost exactly as advertised. 60 seconds is like an EPA gas mileage rating: a trained expert in a laboratory setting could probably set this up in 60 seconds, but not the average person. Still, it sets up quite fast. You definitely need the rain fly, which easily snaps into place.I gave it two stars for light weight because this rig isn't light. Having said that, I don't believe this was really promoted as being light weight. It's for car/truck camping, obviously, which is exactly what I bought it for.As far as striking the tent is concerned, it takes longer than 60 seconds. It takes time for the air to seep out, as with any tent. My only disappointment is the carrying bag: you are not going to get this tent folded back like it came in the bag. It just ain't gonna happen. Even though the bag has a tear away expansion strip, that tent isn't going back into the bag neatly. I'm looking for a large duffel bag for storing it.On balance, this is pretty much what it purports to be. I think it's a great value for the money and I'm happy with my purchase.

  This is a very lightweight tent and easy to set up, but before we had completely set it up we noticed a plastic piece,  that slides down one ""leg"" pulling the tent taut, was broken. Whether that came that way or it happened when we set it up, we aren't sure. We bought the tent as an out-of-the-sun play place for our grandson, so will try to rig something or will contact Coleman and see if we can get the piece.  Buyers should just bear in mind that some of the pieces are plastic and take extra care opening the tent.

  We purchased this tent before going on a two week cross country roadtrip.  I particularly wanted a quick-setup tent since we'd be getting to camp sites late.  This fit the bit and was even easier than I expected!  My husband had no trouble setting it up within minutes, and I was able to help without getting frustrated over tent poles.  We did not purchase a separate rain fly...  The first night we camped it stormed very badly during the night!  The tent held up and didn't leak at all.  I think this is a ""6-person tent"", but unless you cram people in like sardines, this is a very comfortable 2-person tent, maybe 3-person tent.  We also were able to put a queen size air mattress in with no problem.  Love this tent and hope to use it for many summers to come!

  Great first tent for my 16 year old daughter.  We RV a lot and she wanted her own space so she asked for a tent.She put the tent up in a couple of minutes.  10 minutes later she was moved-in.  She lived in this for two weeks.It stayed dry in severe down-pours and stayed up in high winds..  The tent also held the heat from he portable heater in freezing temps.  Using the vents is a must as condensate can build up.Tear down is another story.  Once out of the box, it's very bulky and hard to put back in the carry bag.  I can live with it, just be patient.

  Wow. The easiest tent I've ever had to set up; truly. Just think of an umbrella; and how it collapses to fold down to close?  Same concept. The geniuses at Coleman!!  The tent is very large; even though it can easily accommodate 4 people in sleeping bags, I believe that for 2 adults and their belongings it is more suitable. And you may need another person to set it up. Even though I am an able bodied male; I still had a bit of trouble doing it on my own... just a mild struggle, but not impossible.The only downside is that it is NOT waterproof from the get-go. Yes, I tested it on a rainy weekend; and both occasions just a bit of water came through on the top/highest center point and some on the seams; just droplets, not deluges. But that was because we did not have the Rainfly that you have to buy separately. I can update you all once I try camping again in rainy weather with the Rainfly that just arrived this week!  :)Other than that, you won't be disappointed. I do wish that Coleman would include the Rainfly with this particular tent; as they did with my previous Coleman tent. But oh well. At least Amazon sells it!  It's a must have as most reviewers have attested to: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006GJ8NX0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

  I got this for a trip that I took last week, and I wanted another tent that I don't have to crawl into.I got the 6-person tent, and also bought the rain fly that was recommended. I thought there must be a mistake, and maybe I got the 4-person tent?  Nope. I'd hate to see the size of the 4-person tent!As stated in the reviews, the door on this tent is not easy to zip closed, but it works. There is a one inch or so gap at the bottom where the two zippers meet. Maybe meant for power cords? It's too bad that they didn't put the nice hinged door flap on this like some of their other tents.I didn't have any trouble with leaking during the brief downpour that we had, and it was easy to set up alone for someone with lots of tent erecting experience. When packed away it's heavier and 1.5 times longer than my Coleman Montana 8-person tent.I'm not super excited about it, but it's a decent tent that should last quite a while.

  We purchased this tent as a Christmas gift. Being that we live in the northern US, we waited until summer to go camping with our young children. When we set up the tent, the stitching was completely undone along the main seam on the front right corner. We immediately contacted Coleman and sent photographs, and they never responded at all. We purchased it again to exchange the defective tent, but this tent came with a stitching issue in the same area with several holes in that spot and more holes along the front above the door. At that point we contacted Amazon, and they were completely unhelpful...simply stating they can't (won't is more accurate) do anything about it. Can't replace it, can't refund it, can't contact the manufacturer/seller (Coleman) on our behalf since they won't respond to us. So we're stuck with a $150 tent with holes in it. Buy a different tent.

  Easy up is a breeze.  Fits two full size cots (maybe more) perfectly.  Our first use of the tent was a 4-day overlanding trip to Death Valley.  We experienced sideways rain and heavy gusts of wind up to 50 mph.  We staked down (we purchased heavier duty stakes) and tied off to our vehicle and hoped for the best through the night.  No leaks and no weak points -- this tent is structurally sound.  A member of our group had a similar off-brand easy up tent and it did not survive the heavy gusts of wind.  In fact, theirs leaked and one of the sides collapsed in the night.  But not our Coleman.Side note:  We originally purchased the smaller 4pp instant setup by Coleman but it didn't fit our cots.  We loved the tent but again it just wasn't large enough for our needs.

  I purchased this tent since my son is now in boy scouts and I am joining him on camping trips. I have the largest tent of all the dads, but I am able to set mine up quicker than they can. I wanted something easy as my son has to setup his own tent and I need to do this myself quickly. It is worth every penny to be able to put it up and take it down especially in the dark. When I got this I pulled it out and set it up in the living room to see how easy it would be. It took my son and I 2-3 minutes mostly because we had to work around the limited space we had. It went up easy and down easy though my son calls it a big marshmallow. It came a few days before our first camp out. Note that we do mostly car camping and this is really not a hikers tent as it is too heavy for that.We arrived at dusk. I got the tarp laid out and the tent setup in two minutes by myself. I found it is easier to stake a corner and stretch it out as you go around in order to set it up quickly. I also ordered the rain fly and found that I had to put it up 3 times in the dark because it was upside down. This took about 15 minutes total as a result, but still very quick if you are paying attention.  It rained, sleeted, and snowed for 2 days while on the trip and the tent held up well with the proper lines. I did not scotch guard it, but will be after the last campout. A little water came in where the sleeping bag had touched the side and where the snow had collected and I did not shake it off before melting. Nothing else was wet inside. It was easy to walk around inside the tent with lots of head room. There was room for us and our gear. I would say this is 4man max as you would have trouble getting 6 into the tent to sleep.My main reason for not having 5 stars is the door was VERY hard to zip. The zipper sticks in the curve along the top and halfway across the bottom as well. I had a tent mate since someone else's tent was broken. They could not figure out how to zipper the door leaving it open a lot. I expected a bit more here and was disappointed with how and where it caught, but as I looked closer it looked like I did miss a center stake for the door which may have resolved the problem. I replaced my previous tent because of the door zipper catching on the flap and shredding it. While this does not catch on the flap it gets stuck in the same place every time. I will update the review after I am able to verify in the next trip to see if this is either a quality control problem or simply setup error. It rained much of the time we were there and it felt a bit Closter phobic in the tent at times. My previous tent that came with a rain fly allowed you to open windows partially to see out and allow air in. This one does not. There is also no cover over the door when raining to get out. I think this was excluded for quicker setup on purpose which may be a good trade off. The windows did have ways to roll up the flaps if necessary, but I never opened them.When folding this up it was very puffy so it is better to partially unzip a few windows or the bottom of the door to let the air out. The tent collapsed and rolled up very easy and was back in the bag in only 3-4 minutes.  Quick setup and take down was key since I also had to dry out the tent when I got home making it easier. You also need to make sure you get the flaps on the door set correctly in order to prevent water from coming down the front of the door. If your tent is wet then it is easer to just strap it up and leave unzipped until you can dry it out. There are straps to tie the tent up when collapsed, but it would have been nice if they were longer and clipped together.Pros:Easy setup/teardownTall and easy to walk around ineasily fits in the bag it comes inCons:zipper designs on the door stink and are difficultOnly vents at the top can open when rainingSome ideas for improvement:The lines could be reflective to prevent tripping peopleBetter door zipperinclude the rain fly, I am not sure why they sell it without oneinclude clip based straps instead of just tiesAllow for windows to open to see and not let the rain inrain fly included could also cover the door better

  Very disappointing tent by Coleman.  I was hoping for this tent to work out because I love how easy and fast this tent is to set up, but it fails in the water resistant/waterproof category.  Water leaked through the thin fabric after an hour of rain.  Stitching at a couple of seams is terrible which also allowed water to leak in. Doesn’t come with a rain fly, which I bought separately which luckily worked and we had no water leaks at the roof.  Also came with a very small hole above the window area, which luckily was covered by the rain fly. Sadly Coleman products just are no longer made well, and it shows with this tent.  Amazon just needs to remove this product all together as a buying potion.  Will be returning for a refund.

  I read as many reviews as possible from different sites before ordering this tent.  I camp at least 3 or 4 times a year and the worst part of it is setting up and breaking down the tent. I don't need to go into detail about how easy this tent is to set up.  The videos speak for themselves.  I will say that if you follow the instructions and watch the videos that you will have an easy time.  Don't get in too much of a hurry though or you may damage something or pinch your fingers.  I will concentrate on the tent itself.  This tent looks like any standard cabin tent from the inside and the outside.  It is roomy and has no sagging due to the well-fit pole frame.  The windows all have sippers for screen ventilation.  There are two ceiling vents.  These are a great idea by Coleman.  The nice thing about the vents is that they can be completely closed or opened.  I did order the rain fly with mine so I can leave the ceiling vents open even when it is raining.  Although this is billed as a 6 person tent I would rate it at a 3 person if you don't want it to be too crowded.  There were 2 of us on our first outing in this tent.  It was very roomy for 2 of us, our mattresses, a small table and then room for our packs.  It is nice to stand up in a tent after years of having to crawl around in small dome tents when I was camping on my own.  I will now also take this tent to camp when it's ONLY me since it is so easy to set up.  Why should I put up with the cramped quarters of my backpack tent when I'm car camping and this tent is so convenient?  I will advise that I did waterproof this tent with silicone before using it and I always use a ground tarp underneath.  With the windows cracked and the vents open we had zero dew inside the tent.  It didn't rain on this first outing so I can't speak to how it would perform but I carefully inspected the seams and saw none of the tell-tale pinholes that might mean a leak.  This is a great tent for my purposes.7-10-14 - I have now used this tent for 3 camp-outs and it continues to impress me. It withstood a 3 hour rainstorm in the Smoky Mountains and was completely bone-dry inside. Again, it should be noted that I took the time to waterproof the tent before ever using it but I am can't imagine that this tent would have leaked.  Properly staked I can't see this tent even budging in the winds associated with a thunderstorm.  One added benefit of the rainfly is that it also has guy ropes to help further anchor the tent.  I always use a ground tarp under the tent, tucked under so water doesn't collect underneath the floor if it does rain.  This is a great tent.P.S.  My own touches - I use those interlocking multi color mats that you can by at Home Depot or Lowes inside the tent for padding and protection and I bought the longest nails, spikes really that I could find at the hardware store which I use for stakes.  They are inexpensive, around a buck each and they do a better job than the cheap stakes the tent comes with.3.23.15 - Have now used this tent several more times and I can't say enough good about it.  Remember that I did take the trouble to waterproof the tent with Kiwi waterproofing aerosol and I also use the rain fly.  It rained again on my most recent outing and we stayed completely dry while we heard those around us scrambling to avoid puddles or as in the case of one camper - just packed up and left.  The ease of setting up and fast setup proved even more useful during the last day of my most recent trip.  Not only could I pack up my tent quickly in the rain, but when I got home I could quickly set it back up to dry once the sun came out.  Now that I've practiced a few times I can set up and take down my tent by myself.  Bottom line- great tent that lets you enjoy camping instead of spending time matching poles or wrestling with inserting fiberglass poles into the sleeves of a dome tent.  Heed my advice though and use a ground cloth, get better tent pegs, use the rain fly and waterproof everything just to be on the safe side.  You can have your tiny 400 dollar one or two person tents for car camping but I will continue to enjoy my tent that is more like a house and lets me stand up and stretch out with all my gear. BTW I have an expensive Catoma one person tent that takes longer to set up than my Coleman Instant Tent.

  We were in need of tent that could comfortably sleep three-four people and one that we could stand-up in. After looking at several tents we decided on the Coleman 6-person instant tent. The tent truly is instant. It is up and operational in about 1 minute. The telescoping poles are built-in or attached to the tent, so one person can easily set up or take down. Quality is fairly standard - nothing fancy. Most of the connecting pieces are plastic, so I don't expect this tent to have a long life - we will see. The tent has large, zippered windows, zippered vents at the top and standard small storage pocket. My husband is 6' and can stand up straight and move around in the tent. The only real drawback for me, the tent is quite large when stored. Unlike our other tents that rollup fairly tight and store away in a small bag. All in all, we like it and I think if the plastic connectors don't break, we will get several years of use out of it.Other reviews stated the tent leaked - my opinion - I don't think the tent is made for extreme weather and only seems appropriate for summer or light weather. The tent did sweat some one night, but the windows and vents were shut tight (daughter was afraid of a bear attack - LOL). The second night we left one of the windows slightly open and didn't have any problems.

  I purchased this tent several years back, and initially I loved it, until we had rain one night. I actually thought it was a fluke that some of the rain filtered into the tent, maybe thru the seams. We just came back from camping out west and we used this tent again. Not only did we use it, we talked my daughter into buying the same tent in hopes it was a fluke that some rain came in our tent. The adhesiveness of the seams was coming undone as well. I had purchased a rainfly a couple weeks ago in hopes that it would prevent any additional rain from seeping into the ""waterproof"" tent, but it did not. The first night my daughter had set up her tent, it had also rained and all of their blankets and clothes ended up wet.  As you can imagine with temps in the 40's in the mornings, up in the mountains,  and all items wet, I am absolutely furious about the performance of this tent. I love the size, space, and ease of setting up, but what's the point when u smell must from rain that leaked in a tent.

We put a queen sized air bed in and it fit with a little room at the sides to spare. For my spouse and I, we need a bit more space but for our kids this would work well.

  Very disappointed in this tent. Set up could not be easier, but this tent is ANYTHING but waterproof. I sent this tent up and went on a float trip. During this time it started to rain. I was hoping to come back to a dry tent but that was not the case.When I opened the tent I found that the floor had standing water. Thankfully my air matress was an elevated model, or I'd have been sleeping in water.Later on it began to rain again and water dripped in steadily through the top of the tent. For about 5 hours I had to endure Chinese water torture as the water dripped on me all through out the night. I woke up a wet mess.A friend who had also bought this tent had the same issue.

  Easy to set up, roomy inside. Floor is nice and durable. Ventilation is good in cooler climates.Flaws: Need two hands to zip closed. Still tricky to zip, which is not good when it rains as water can get in the corner of you don’t zip it tight and make sure the flaps are in place.Corners leak when it rains, even with seam sealer. We waterproofed before using but water still came in the sides. Thankfully our campsite was sloped so we had puddles only at the bottom of the tent. Would have been a disaster otherwise.Rain fly can be purchased separately but it drops water all down the side, leaking into the tent. Through the lower section/darker half. Also, does not have adequate covering over the entrance so if you open while it’s raining, the inside gets soaked.Overall, we did not have major flooding in the tent but this needs a better rain fly and Coleman should do better inspection before putting on the market.

  We have used this tent for a 60 day road trip through the national parks. Worked great. I did apply waterproofing to all the seams (but you need to do that to any new tent and then as needed). Had every kind of weather on the trip: 90+ degrees, hail, winds 30mph, and woke up to 1 inch of snow one morning. In the high winds I added 2 extry guy lines half way up the legs on the wind side. 30 mph winds are pretty strong for a tent this size. Was always water tight in all weather. EASY set up. It literally does go up in 1 minute. By the time you set up guy lines and stakes you may have 5-10 minutes into it max. I bought a 2nd one just like it for my daughter and her boys. A great value for the price.

It really does go up so easily I as a woman with no muscle put it up by myself in the living room in under two min. This is for car camping or backyard camping only. Its too heavy to lug very far. We didn't camp where there was rain so I cant comment on the elements. I didn't see a rainfly to fit it so i just threw a tarp over it. I don't think it would handle arctic elements, but then again if you're using this tent you're not far from your car. So if the weather is bad just get in your car and drive home. :)

  Very easy to install quickly with just one person. Unfold and extend the 4 legs and voila you have a tent. The same can't be said about putting it back into a bag though. Why companies feel the need to use the tightest possible bags is beyond me that hold these things. This is not a dark room tent despite what some of the info says. It filters some light but unless you use a canopy or rain fly you'll never block out enough light to really sleep in if you're sensitive to light. As for the rain fly that's said to be integrated... It's OK at best. You can survive light rainfall but the problem is that while it technically blocks a bit of water the second you touch any wet side the water bleeds through and whatever is against the edge will be wet. That's annoying. If this had better light filtering and the material truly resisted water it would be an amazing tent and would be worth 5 stars. Instead it's just OK. BTW it Fits a queen mattress but if you have children they won't have much room to sleep. This is more of a roomy 3-4 person tent with standing room and no air mattresses. I don't think you can fit anything larger than a queen mattress through the front door, and yes there's only one door.

  I bought this a few weeks ago.  The day I got it we set it up in the back yard (it took about 20 seconds!) and blasted it with the garden hose all along the seams and set the sprinkler on it for about an hour.  No leaks at all.  Not a drop.The real test was taking it on a 6 day camping trip to the Florida keys.  The second night we were there a storm blew in with driving rain, 35-40 mile an hour gusts, thunder and lightning.  The winds scared the heck out of us and the tent billowed back and forth violently.  I just knew the tent would twist and collapse around us.  It held up like a champ and we stayed dry all night.  In the morning I saw the inside walls were all slightly damp but I don’t think it was leakage.  It appeared to be condensation but it wasn’t even enough to drip down the walls.In short, if my house ever catches on fire, I’ll grab this tent and run.

I tried to seam seal the inside seams first with Coleman seam sealer but some of the holes are rather large due to the difference in materials.  After a large thunderstorm yesterday there was a bit of water inside but I didn't measure it to find out how much.  I'd say it is within the amount of water from their video claims.  However, not liking the idea of waking up in even a small puddle, I used clear silicone to seal the outside seam and the bottom corners.

",5.0,Kelly Keefe,"Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2016","









  
  
    
  Have had the 14 X 10 Instant Tent for a couple of years and have loved it.  But since young son entered Boy Scouts and dragging it along for a year decided I needed something better fit for just the two of us. The Mom Unit will not go along and the 14 X 10 was just too big for the two of us.  This fits the bill nicely.  Plenty of space and headroom without being massive like the 14 X 10.  For novice campers, take the stated ""occupancy rate"" and half it.  That's reality if you don't want to be packed in like sardines (minus the oil) and, truthfully, I wouldn't even like to put three people into this, but you could, cheek to jowl.For the raters who said this is tough to get back into the carry bag, turn the bag over.  There is a sewn section you can remove to expand the carry bag.  We didn't have any problems when we did this.  It's still a bit tight, but it's do-able.Didn't have any rain, so I didn't use the rain fly I bought, but you SHOULD buy one.  Not just for rain, but to have some stand-off room to keep the tent cooler in the warmer months.  We're pretty much finished with the camping season for the winter, but come Spring I'm going to buy some seam sealer to further waterproof the tent.My only complaints is the lower part of the tent I got is black and I'd have preferred another color for obvious reasons and my experience with the other model is it's virtually impossible to get replacement parts from Coleman.DO buy some sturdier stakes though.  I'd suggest about 10 heavier steel stakes if you get the tent and rain fly, four at the bare minimum. Two more wouldn't hurt, just in case.Overall, pleased with it.  We'll see how well it stands up over time.  Nice for both or us to have some headroom and legroom to both be able to stand and dress or move at the same time with all the impedimenta in place.

  Used to be you could depend on Coleman for high quality gear, but no longer. Easy enough to set up, but as soon as you start to look at it closely it's obvious that the people making/testing these tents aren't being paid enough to care. The seams were sloppy and unfinished in many places, and the door was sewn with too little fabric - so much so that in zipping it shut the tent fabric gets pulled so tight the seams around the door started to tear the first time I set it up. A night of light rain (thankfully the test run and not our trip!) left the interior floor covered with several massive puddles. Sadly, I am returning this one.

  Coleman advertises that you can set up this tent in 1 minute. It took me 2 minutes, but I'm disabled. Taking the tent down and putting it into the carry sack took 4 minutes.

The tent does less well in wind. I suspect that anything over 40 mph might present a problem.Despite being a ""6 person"" tent, this really fits 2 people comfortably.

Next time when the weather conditions are better and nerves are a little more calm I'm sure it will go better.

My only negative is some small amount water from the sprinklers gets in through the windows or door every day because the closure zippers don’t quite overlap completely.

  I guess the 60 sec setup time is accurate...just so long as you don’t plan on staking this tent down, securing the guide lines, or putting on the rainfly (sold separately). Disassembly time however is less than that if you are sleeping in the tent and a gust of wind comes up. I used this tent for one night and we had 15-20 mph winds and the tent collapsed 3 separate times throughout the night, each time resulted in someone getting hit in the head by one of the pole coming down. Trying to set the tent back up in the wind resulted in every pole bending. Whoever decided that a normal set of tent poles were to complicated and replaced them with this stupid design should be fired. None of the elbow joints between the walls and roof lock and the connection point at the peak just allows the poles to rotate 360 degrees. Terrible and stupid design. I doubt you could even set this tent up indoors with a fan running on low speed and not have it collapse. My other complaint with this tent is that it doesn’t come with a rain fly. Who doesn’t include a rainfly with their tent? Coleman, that’s who. And the rain fly they sell separately for this tent is utterly useless except to determine which way the wind is blowing. Honestly I’d have been better off sleeping under a tarp. Save yourself the headache, literally, and buy a real tent.

  It does hold up to strong winds especially when laden with goods. It is also very roomy. I'm 5'3"" and I can stand straight up inside this tent. I was able to set it up myself with no prior tent setting up experience. The down sides: this tent does not keep the water out as shown by this morning's pics. In fact, it bleeds the water in especially at the seams.  It does not keep the cold out as I hoped it would but it does keep the breeze out. It gets very hot in spring and summer like climates but that is alleviated by exposing the netting, which lets air flow in. The netting, however, does not keep out mosquitoes or small flies. It does not live up to the hype but in moderate temperatures, dry weather, bug free and mild wind environments, this tent works great.

  This tent was easy to setup, but mine came damaged. They did not assemble the poles correctly, so it was hard to put up and take down, my husband had to reassemble the poles. There was also a small tear on the floor of the tent. I have reached out to Coleman, without any reply so far. Other than these issues, seems like it will be a great tent. Will update my review if Coleman replies.

    Leaks a lot of water in moderate rain; for fair weather camping only
  
",2.0,John,"Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2018","









  
  
    
  I bought this tent aware of mixed reviews as to rain resistance. I tested it last night in my backyard during a moderate, sustained rain. I carefully closed all the zippers and the roof vent.The tent leaked a lot of water, much more than I'd find acceptable while camping. It wasn't condensation as no one was in the tent during the testI feel that Amazon's description of the tent, which describes an ""integrated vented rainfly"" and includes ""WeatherTec system – patented welded floors and inverted seams help keep water out"" borders on misleading.Several reviews state the additional rainfly is not helpful, although some say that it is.In light of the delightfully easy setup, you might consider this for fair weather car camping. Definitely not recommended if rain is forecast.

    Overall nice tent, especially for casual campers
  
",4.0,E.,"Reviewed in the United States April 20, 2014","









  
  
    
  Overall nice tent, especially for casual campers.Pros:Convenient: Very quick and simple setup; 1 minute or less of setup time and you have a free-standing tent. I've even set it up at night with very little hassle.Sturdy build:  As long as it is staked down properly, it will hold up very well even in very windy conditions.Plenty of ventilation when you open up the windows, which are on all 4 sides, plus there's a zippered mesh roof vent that you can open or close from inside.Roomy if you accept the fact that no 4-man rated tent will actually fit 4 people and gear... this is really more suitable for 2 people max.  Fits a queen-size air mattress and that leaves about 2.5 feet of storage space to spare running the length of the tent.  Ceiling height is just shy of 5 feet.Cons:Waterproofing out of the box is not great, I would recommend sealing the tent prior if you are expecting any kind of precipitation. On the same note, it is ridiculous that this tent does not come with the rain-fly included.Only has one door flap, and it is fairly small when you consider the size of the tent.  Also, opening the door involves 2 separate zippers that meet at the lower outer corner of the door, rather than having one continuous run.  This leaves a gap that ants and other small insects could use to gain entry.Weight and packed size: The tent is necessarily heavy due to it's construction, and does not pack compactly. Folded down, the tent/poles package is a little over three feet long, the included carry bag is sized appropriately though, so getting it back in there has not been an issue.

  This tent is awesome. If you’re like me and don’t want to deal with poles and frames and nonsense setting a tent up...buy this. I didn’t even look at the instructions, took 90 seconds to set up. The only things that could be better - increase rain coverage...it didn’t rain on me and seems like it’d be fine in regular rain, but if it starts going hard...could be an issue. Then again, you’re in a tent, soooo.  Also the zipper could be a bit more accessible...add a little plastic piece to the zipper handle so you don’t need to search for it/only have the leverage of a small zipper. All in all though seriously, super super happy w this tent. Surprisingly happy. If you want an easy awesome experience, look no further, don’t waste time with other “instant” tents, this is the one you want. For one person it was like a suite in the woods. For 4, tight. For 2, prob perfect.

  When it comes to camping, my greatest pain in the ""you know what"" is set up and take down of the campsite. This tent makes it so simple and fast it is amazing that no one thought of it sooner. We just returned from a three night excursion in the desert and it held up just fine. What was even better was that I asked my kids to set it up at our second site and they had it up in about five minutes (if they weren't arguing, it could go much faster). Very simple and fast. It takes longer to stake it down than it does to put the tent up.We didn't have the rain (it was a desert) so I can't comment on the water ""proofness"" of the tent, but there was a continuous twenty plus mph wind with some gusts the first night. It got blown around quite a bit, but it didn't move, tear, or collapse from the strongest gusts.  (A neighboring tent had the old curved pole style tent skeleton from a brand sold by a big box store that doesn't even sell walls and their tent was wobbling back and forth like it was about to fall over)So it seems sturdy...but we did invest in real stakes as this comes with the typical little wire type. It is a big box though.  The bag it comes in is narrow, but long, and it is not very lightweight. Definitely a car camper tent. The tent folded up is about four feet long, so it does take up space even collapsed.  And I don't understand how you'd get six in there.  Three was great.  Four would be a little tight. Quality thus far seems outstanding.  I'm very happy with it.

  Completely ruined out camping trip and this tent turned it into a nightmare. First night it was only light rain and it leaked at every side so badly it was flooding our sleeping areas. This is even with the rainfly installed. Not at all water proof and very far from even water resistant. Bought it regardless of some reviews indicating theirs leaked because of the coleman advertisement with them testing it under extreme conditions of wind and rain. They don't test any apparently. Only test one from production and call it good and everything else goes out to customers with flawed products. DO NOT buy! Save yourself the headache.

    Faulty Zipper, Straight Out of the Box

  I purchased this tent back in December 2019, with the intention of using it during our summer months in Alaska. We finally have a weekend that's nice enough to go camping, so I just opened the box today and set it up in our yard to test it out. As soon as I closed the door, I found that the bottom zipper had come off its track. There appears to be several stitches at the end of the zipper that are frayed or missing, leaving us unable to securely close the bottom of the tent. With the amount of rain and bugs we have here, this defect pretty much negates the use of this tent for us. I'm hoping this is just a one-off, and that I can get a replacement sent to us. Otherwise, the tent was very easy to set up, and has plenty of room inside.

  This tent is the easiest and most lightweight tent out there.  It arrived quickly and every day I told myself we need to set this up before we use it so we know what we are doing.  Well every day came and went.  Life is too busy for a practice run for us.  We went on our vacation and packed it anyway.  We finally got to a place where we could use the tent, took it out of the bag and set it up practically without reading the instructions!  It was that simple.  The downside was, our queen size air mattress  had to be filled inside the tent because it doesnt fit through the door!  With that being said, it's probably in our best interest to find a smaller mattress as this one is nearly wall to wall.  There are literally just inches on all four sides.  But it was a good night as we did not get wet.

I am positive it was the condensation. I opened the top vents for the night bu it did not help. Still thinking if I should return it.Update,Terrible one and I had to change it to one star.

  Tent is great, way smaller than expected. There is no chance that this is for 4 people... Not even 3 honestly if you want to have your overnight bag near you. My boyfriend and I have a queen mattress inside and just enough room to keep our stuff next to us. We are pretty cramped unless we are laying down so we would strictly use it for sleeping, not to hangout in. ALSO! Tent is heavy so do not plan to travel with it on your back to camp somewhere.We are also dealing with a fabrication issue with the door. We have a hard time shutting the door and it seems to be because the material is too tight between where zipper meets the fabric. We have noticed it start to cause stress on the material and zipper is pulling from material. Might have to slit and sew in a new piece of fabric in order to levitate the stress.

  This is the second Coleman Instant Setup Cabin Tent I have purchased.  The first one was a 6 person and I loved it.  I added the second one for my expanding family.With each tent I added the optional rainfly accessory plus treated the tent with some water proofing and seam sealer before taking it to the mountains.  They have kept the elements off my head for a couple yrs now and do well against the wind.These tents set up in seconds, seriously.  I have had fellow campers offer to help set up the tents but politely said I didn’t need assistance.

  I can’t believe how far tents have come. I literally set this up in under a minute & take down was under 5 mins. Take down is longer because you have to get enough air out to get it in the bag.

They had plenty of room & said they could have easily fit a few more. I also purchased the “used” option for a pretty good discount & it was brand new, only the box had been opened.

  I purchased this tent several years ago. I LOVE it! For those who have complained about leaking, I would ask what they did about waterproofing. The first thing I did was set this tent up in my backyard. I used waterproofing on all seams and zippers, inside and out. I used a ground cloth and purchased the fly, which i also waterproofed. I used this tent for a solid month of camping on  my own. I was particularly interested in a tent I could manage on my own, I am a 70+ year old woman. This was great! During the month of camping, I had rain and wind, and this tent held up like a charm! I highly recommend it. For the $$, it's a bargain!

The seams and windows caused us to be soaked and cold all night. The fabric itself is not waterproof and still can have drips pour down from the ceiling.  All in all its very nice. I am 6'2"" and was able to stand in the center with just bending my head just a little bit which was nice. We had 3 full blow up beds and managed to still have plenty of room to store our things. Plus, putting it up and taking it down is very simple. It was a champ when we had close to 50 mph winds. Did not even have a stack rip out. Pretty durable when it comes to staying in place. I would say it's fairly reasonable, but if it rains go grab a tarp!

  We are the talk of the campgrounds with this Instant Tent. My husband can put it together by himself in about three minutes, and certainly in the 60-second range with my assistance.We have huge family-reunion style camping trips every year and every year our tent is the easiest to put up and take down. Even though the time we save constructing and deconstructing it is immediately spent helping other family members with their cumbersome tents, it is nice to have one less big thing to do when camping and more time in the long run enjoying the outdoors.I have had absolutely no issues with this tent. I have found that it also seems to do a better job keeping us warm in cooler weather. When other campers are talking about how cold the weather was overnight, we spend the evenings pretty comfortable. We don't tend to spend much time in it in the daytime, though, so I could imagine it getting pretty hot in there during a sunny summer day. That seems pretty standard for a tent though.Another note: bugs. I am COMPLETELY uncomfortable with the idea of a tent teeming with bugs. I can say that we have not had any issues with bugs getting inside the tent--as long as you keep it zipped up, you shouldn't have any problems. It's pretty bug-secure!As far as capacity, I think 6 people *could* go inside tetris style, but it probably won't be the most comfortable arrangement. I can imagine if someone had to get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, someone would end up getting stepped on. We have used it as a family of three and now a family of four. It is a pretty perfect size for our family of two adults and two children under the age of three.If you are in the market for a family tent you can't go wrong with this one.

The seams have started to come undone this year - prior I did not use seam sealer. The assembly is crazy easy. The inside is very roomy, you can easily stand straight up inside (I’m 5’6”) and have room above you - makes it easy to change clothing. All windows do have a zipper and ties. Disassembling the tent is easy but rolling it up and getting all the air out and trying to squeeze it together is a pain the a$$, especially when it’s wet.

  I purchased this tent mainly for the cabin style (the ability to stand up in all areas) and the easy assembly. The tent is super easy to set up and we love it! My husband waterproofed it further, so we had no issues with mild rain. we love all the windows and that its tall enough to stand. I'm giving this 4 stars for 3 reasons. $1- Its So hard to get back in the bag!!!! oh my gosh I wish companies would catch on that the tent will never fit into the bag again as it does when packaged. It takes my husband wrestling it and then straddling it so I can tie the rope until we can get it into the bag. Not a deal breaker,  but it's not pleasant.  Don't disassemble this tent alone or with someone you love unless you feel like arguing lol. It does NOT go smoothly! #2- I prefer a tent with a place for an extension cord to run through somewhere other than the door, All of our other tents have this. #3- Again, not a deal breaker,  but the zipper starts at the bottom. and there is only 1. It got annoying having to constantly bend all the way down to try and reach it to pull it up. I prefer either 2 zippers so you can choose,  or starting from the top so I can find the zipper when I'm not bent over sweating in 90 degree weather! :DAll in all we live this tent! Would definitely buy again!

  I bought this tent during the winter so I got a good deal. Went to test the tent out this week before we went camping to make sure the tent was ok to go. Opened the brand new box pulled out the tent and when my boys and I went to set it up one of the poles was stuck. Couldn't pull it out. Checked it and they put the pole in backwards.  Tried to see if I could return it and get another one before we go camping and I couldn't find my order number because it's been so long. So I decided to take matters in my own hand and try to fix it myself.  It took me over 2 hours to take that piece out and put it the right way. So lesson learned if your buying from Amazon be sure to check your item first. I was thinking this was a return and they just put it back on the self to resell it.

  Item arrived damaged. it would be way too much of a chore to return it because that involves carrying it to another place, and is tent is really heavy to shoulder more than a mile, and my bike is damaged, so I have no way of transporting it except by hand. The roof leaks, so I had to put a tarp over it and there's a hole in the side, so I will eventually have to use duct tape. I don't mind, but other customers might mind . Coleman or somebody should check the product before shipping it. Since the tent is so heavy, the people handling it during shipping probably drop it or something.

  Before last night, I had never been in a tent, and certainly never put one up.  I bought this tent because I currently cannot sleep in my house.  After watching the youtube videos, I put it up in no time.  Got all my stuff in it and settled down for the night.  Then it started raining !!  Boy, was I glad I had a tent!  There was no problem with any rain leaking in.  I love the big windows and the size is great for my bedding, a chair and my porta toilet!!  Have lots of room to spare.  In the am there was alot of condensation on the inner walls, but when I went outside, the humidity and the grass etc. was also full of moisture.  I'm in a tent, I don't expect to be in a hotel.  I love it so far.  Also, the price I got was great!! and it arrived very quickly.After several days use, I still love this tent.  However, we did have a heavy rain and though I did not see the rain or feel it, there was water on the floor when I awoke.  I have just purchased the RAINFLY on Amazon, and hopefully that will solve that problem.One more UPDATE.  I received the rainfly and it works great.  We had some really heavy rain recently and absolutely none got inside the tent.  (I even forgot to zip up one of the windows.  I am still VERY happy with this tent.

  It really needs a fly. the first night I used the tent it didn't rain but there was a heavy dew - in the morning I woke up with water dripping on my head - it seems to leak above the window - it looks like there was some attempt to seal the seams in the factory - but it's not adequate. The next day - there was a thunderstorm and heavy downpour - the tent stood up well to that without any water coming in - later there was a long soaking rain - which did show up some leaks - again - above the back window and front window.There is only one door and it's over to the side - it would be hard to use with two cots set up. The walls slope - I was using the Teton XXL camp cot which stretched from the back wall to the front. The cot level was just below the windows. With all the windows opened the tent is airy and invites every breeze - nice on a hot day or night - and very useful for drying the tent out in the sunshine after the rain.It is very easy to put up - takes straightly longer to pack down into the provided bag. When I took it down - I found there was a pool of water that had gotten trapped on top - not sure how that happened. The packed up tent is kind of long and took up a lot of space in the car.The floor of this tent is that thick plasticy stuff that seems to be like tarp material. I don't feel the need for a groundsheet. the bath tub design was good protection against heavy rain. the floor is one of the best features of this tent.So, in summary: easy to put up - needs a fly - kind of heavy and bulky to transport.

  I purchased this tent a few weeks ago, it is alright. I noticed a tear on the inner right corner of the tent - on the outside is where the tent leg is. I used it a few times, I didn't noticed it before until I was sweeping it out --so i don't know if it was already there or if it is something new. But overall, this tent is easy to put up, putting it away takes a little bit of time but it is easier than most tent tear downs.My rating is taking durability into account and also it is ok in light rain but can get wet. Spray on tent sealant, you should be ok in light rain.

  This is a fantastic tent. My daughter and I arrived at the campsite before my husband and were left to set this up on our own. We are “indoor girls” and it was dark so I was a little worried. We had it up in no time at all and high fived each other for our accomplishment. The real test came when we went to sleep as it was extremely cold, windy and some light rain through the night. We could hear the crazy wind howling yet did not feel so much as a draft. We stayed quite warm and very dry as well. This tent is extremely weather proof. The zippers also worked well and the material is nice and sturdy. What a wonderful little tent. I highly recommend to anyone who is looking to purchase. You will not regret it.

  Tried it out in the backyard and it took me and my 10-year-old niece  62 seconds to set it up. Took a camping on the beach and I love the panoramic view. We got two rounds of rain in the middle of the night. 1st round was heavy rain for about an hour and I was a bit nervous. 2nd round I was able to enjoy with confidence in my tent cabin. Happy to say that not a single droplet got in. I recommend you get heavy duty spikes to keep it secure but that’s true for any tent. My 5 year old son and I love it and highly recommend it. I got the rainfly and it was even better in the rain because I could keep the window open without getting water inside. Later that day the Santa Ana winds kicked up something fierce. 40+ wind gust and the tent held its own like a champ!! We didnt feel like there was much wind when inside the tent but once outside we could feel it. Great tent, just invest on heavy duty spikes and go camping!!! Love love love it!!!

  After doing a little research I opted for this Coleman Instant tent. 1) I actually thought it was made in the USA. Silly me for assuming that. 2) The demonstration videos seemed a little misleading. There is nothing instant about the pitching or the take down. Regular pole setup tents pitch just as fast and weigh a lot less. 3) We took the tent straight from the box to our camp site and noticed several small holes at the rear of the tent where the (thin) floor meets the wall.Needless to say that I am returning this tent and getting another pole style tent.

  Very easy to set up and take down, and a lot easier to stow than my old tension-pole Coleman tent.  The storage bag allows the user to rip off the labels - and thusly, the storage bag will accommodate a newly re-packed tent (because everybody knows that those danged bags don't properly store a tent once it's been unfurled!).  Zips up well, and can easily store all your gear if you're one or two bodies with a queen sized air mattress. With the added rain fly (sold separately), works well for drizzly weather.  A bit heavy, so something useful if you're not on a long trek to your site.

  Worst tent system ever. Product arrived with rips on bag and darkroom material. The legs 'click' when extended but there is no locking mechanism at the elbows or connections so the poles constantly want to twist and bend the whole system back into itself. I setup in the yard for airing out and sealing the seams. I didn't have a chance to seal it because even with the rain fly on, a small gust of wind collapsed the tent right where we would have been sleeping if we were using it. I read other reviews with similar complaints before purchasing and wish I had heeded the warnings.

  When this tent arrived, I put it up in the back yard. It went up very easy, adding the rainfly went on with ease also. I thought I would love this tent. It was spacious inside and the height was perfect as I wanted a tent we could stand up inside. Then, I took the tent down and packed it for our camping trip, the take down was easy as putting it up.  Shortly after setting up the tent at our campsite, it began to rain. The tent leaked all around the seams, water was running down the seam at the door and one of the windows. We had to move our gear to the center of the tent and slept in our cars that night. I contacted Coleman about our issues but have not received a reply. The positives I can say about this tent is that it was easy to put up/take down, the size was great and it looked good. The negative, you will get wet if it rains, and that outweighs all the positives. I do  not recommend this tent.

  Did lots of research trying to find the best family tent for our family of 4 to go camping.  I was nervous because my wife had never been tent camping before and insisted I buy a good tent to make a great experience. This tent has been awesome for the two trips we have taken so far.Here are some of my thoughts regarding cool features about this tent:- Size:  we were able to fit 4 twin size air mattresses side by side in the tent (and that's it.  That's from one edge of the tent to the other.)  That left a good amount of space for our gear and our dog at the foot of the bed.Great for sleeping 4 people, probably good for 6.  Definitely not 10 (unless they're all kids and really comfortable with each other).  Height is nice.  Great for me (at 6'1"") to be able to stand up in the tent.- Darkness: LOVE the dark rest.  It keeps the tent dark enough or us to be able to sleep in on a bright summer morning.  Keeps it nice and cool too.- set-up: super easy.  I was able to set it up by myself in about 5-10 minutes (with a helper, probably would be under 5 minutes).  For a tent that size that is amazing.- weather: this one I was really worried about.  We were lucky to have dry days both camping trips so I unfortunately can't comment on how waterproof it is.  Did hold up to wind nicely and the re-enforcing strings it comes with are very helpful for this.  Note that the tent comes with a rainfly and without it the roof of the tent is just mesh.- door: it is hinged (has a flexible pole inside the door to turn it into an actual ""door"" and not just a piece of fabric.  Not sure initially how I would like this, but in hindsight, I LOVE it.  Most of the time, you can keep the door ""closed"" but not zipped shut, allowing you to go in and out of the tent without leaving the tent door ""open"".  Nice feature!- weight:  it's heavy.  I can carry it easily from the car to the tent-site but this is definitely NOT a backpacking tent. But then again, what ""10-person tent"" is?  Coleman provides a nice bag for it (that allows for extra room after unpacking from the factory).In summary, so far I'm impressed with this tent.  I'm hoping it can stand up to a rainstorm or two, but for car camping it's got everything we need.  Love it.

  This is a pretty great tent. When buying a tent, always keep in mind that it's measured for kids. If it's a 2 person tent it will only really fit 1 adult comfortably. That's nothing against this tent specifically.We did not have to waterproof this tent, it rained pretty heavily the first time using it. The only water inside was due to condensation from keeping it completely closed up while sleeping in the rain storm. Although I did strap a separate tarp over it for added protection.It's easy to put up, but a bit more difficult to take down as it doesn't have built in straps to go around it.Also the only other negative aspect is it has no rain fly over the door. The angle that the front of the tent is on will let water right in if opening the door while raining.Overall it's a well working tent for 2 adults (4 person tent).

  I've seen many comments about this tent not being good for camping if it's raining.  Keep in mind that almost all tents are water resistant, not water proof.  I placed a tarp under the footprint of the tent to protect the tent ""bathtub'.  This will help shield the bottom from sharp rocks, stickers, and glass pieces.  Also, we take our shoes off when entering the tent.  I didn't want to spend $40 bucks for the rain fly, so I went to home depot and bought second tarp to cover the top so the water doesn't gather in the low spots.  The first time I used the tent, easy to set up.  The anchors are worthless, buy some better ones.  It rained half the day, almost all night, during three days of camping.  My family didn't get wet at all, even though I could feel water puddles under the bathtub.  The side of the tent did 'sweat' after so much water, but the tent kept us dry.  Would buy again.

  We ordered the tent after reading a review on how to weatherproof the tent. We followed the instruction but ended up with a wet and humid tent. Basically even if you weatherproof the seams of the tent, the water sips through all walls of the tent including the bottom. The tent is not recommended to be used on rainy days.

The sides are still very much exposed.The set up is really quick and convenient. And the price was good. That's why I would give 2 out of 5.

  PROS:* This tent sets up very, very quickly.CONS:* This item DOES NOT fit 6 people. The fact that it claims to fit 6 people should qualify as criminal negligence. My wife and I had to sleep outside the tent because it truly fits ONLY 4 people.* This item claims to be weatherproof and “will keep you dry” however, this is 100% FALSE. My kids woke up in the middle of the night because one of them rolled over and all of the water collecting at the top of the tent “rained on them”. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT* One of the zippers on one of the windows not there, so we could not zip up that side for privacy while changing. This was not surprising because the zippers on this tent were of very poor quality. I DO NOT believe that this tent would last very long for serious campers.

  After reading several reviews talking about leaks, I soaked mine with the hose for an hour.  Luckily, it didn't leak!  I let it dry and was about to pack it away when I noticed one of the hooks wasn't connected.  This is when the one-star review begins.One of the hooks that fasten the tent to the poles was defective.  Coleman's manufacturer sewed a smaller hook for the top part of the tent onto the bottom, where the poles are thicker.  It snapped instantly when I tried to put it on the thicker pole.

  This thing is tougher than wood pecker lips. Obviously no tent is strong enough to outlast mother nature but they can darn sure try. We tent camp at lake Powell and every trip this tent has seen wind. Bought in June of 19 and we have spent about 50 days in it so far. Doesn't sound like much but in reality that's a lot of camping.Now when you set this thing up you have to guy it down with the rain fly. Most trips this has sufficed for me. If not I have to go drive stakes in the ground and put additional guys in and it holds up. If you don't put guys in the ground you need to find a new pleasure as no tent will suit your needs.Have to say ""Coleman, you dun guud on dis won!""

  This has been a great tent so far. I set it up on my lot on an island in the middle of the Mississippi. I have now had it set up about 8 weeks. I have only stayed in it 4 times. Last night I road out a heavy storm and I didn't have a drop of water in it.I set it up all by myself in about 10 minutes. This was without reading the directions. I could probably do it in 5 now, with help I could do it in 2 minutes.I gave it a 4 rating because when I set it up there was a hole in the floor about as big as quarter. Not happy about it but not going to pack it up and send it back for that. Also, while the front (swinging door) is a very nice feature, it is a pain in the butt to zip a lot of the time.Other than than it was a great purchase. My plan is to just use this one and leave it set up for this summer while I work on rebuilding my cabin. Then I will buy another one for camping in state parks and such.

  Assembles as fast as advertised without any prior practice or trial. I bought this as an upgrade to my dome tent - as I am getting older I am less willing to crawl through little doors and crouch when getting dressed. I use this for 1-person car-camping. Plenty of room, decent quality, easy to assemble and break down. I purchased the rain fly separately. The price on this was great as they just released a newer design that is lighter, packs smaller, and is more spacious with the vertical walls. There's no free lunch, and my engineering brain tells me the poles are less substantial and the vertical walls are more vulnerable to wind with the new design. Nobody is taking these things in a backpack so weight and packing size are not as big of a concern (this tent packs fairly large for what it is).I looked at some other tents. I thought about the quick assembly and whether or not I really needed it. It's not that setting up a traditional tent  takes a lot of time, it's more about the fact that usually setting up (for me) is at the end of the day or in the dark. It's nice that everything is together as a ""1 piece"" assembly (minus the stakes, etc). This was the case for my first time using the tent - it was just about dark and 20 seconds with a flashlight to review the instructions (printed clearly on the top of either the bag or the pole assembly) was enough to get moving and get the tent up in a minute.Zipper quality feels decent. The door zipper starts in the bottom right corner and zips up, so you have to open 2 zippers for a clear entry, or zip one zipper and step over the bottom corner. There are little fold-out vents with supports in the roof that are a nice touch. Ventilation was good, plenty of light/visibility/air with the windows down or cracked (all 4 sides have huge windows :) ) And there are ties for the rolled down windows when needed.Everything is there that needs to be. It's not Mountain Hardware, but for the price it's great.

I have read reviews stating it doesn't fold as easy as set up. A real camper will laugh at that, it's simple and easy. I've also read where it leaks.

  I received my tent the other day, and I have not yet actually been able to use it. So, if anything changes, I will try to update this review. This appears to be a fabulous tent and in becoming colors. I am so happy to be able to trade in my old, bigger and much brighter one, even though it served me well. This appears to be a much better tent, better made than the brand I had. It goes up in a snap, only the four legs snap into place, the upper poles do not on this one. There are windows in the front, and on both sides, but the back does not have a window. Also, my last tent had netting as most of the roof, but this one has a very small air pocket in the roof with what I think they called a ""built in rain fly."" I do not foresee this causing any ventilation issues, and it appears to actually cause the tent to be much more stable than my last one. Even though it was stated that the rain fly is built in, I still purchased the rain fly separately in order to provide a double layer of protection from the rain and sun. The ""Coleman Rainfly Accessory for 4 Person Instant Tent"" for $35.94 on Amazon fits perfectly.

Even when venting the tent (because I thought it might have been condensation) the walls just absorbed all of the fog in the tent walls and ceiling.

  This supposedly 4-person tent must mean 2 adults and 2 very small children because we could only fit one full size and one single air mattress and it filled the entire tent with NO room to walk or set anything.  Then it was defective with holes in the screen and one small hole in the tent side.  Also, the entire tent absorbs water from morning dew or rain.  We used the rain cover which deflected some rain but NOTHING can touch the tent sides because they are water soaked leaving sleeping bags or pillows wet.  We have owned a couple of other tents and have never had to spray them with water repellent spray but it is a must with this tent. I would gladly trade the ease of set-up with better quality any day.  Quick set up is the only thing good about this tent.  We expected a better quality product from Coleman.

  Very pleased with this tent. We have a small Meerkat travel trailer but, in summer, my husband likes to sleep more ""outdoors"" when we camp so we got this tent for him. It goes up in less than a minute and can be taken down in the same amount of time. It does fit the twin Coleman cot with attached air mattress and a small side table with plenty of room in front of the door. Has good ventilation. When the windows are opened, I roll the flaps inward and tuck them in against the mesh. Seems to work well and they stay in place. We also purchased the rain tarp, just in case, but have not needed it yet. One thing my husband noticed (but I didn't see) was a possible, very small, space (hole?) at the seam which he said he can seal. Other than that , it's a great little tent.

I'm a 70+ year old grandma and got it up alone with no trouble. I'm also a long time tent snob so purchasing a (gasp!) coleman tent was not a natural choice. But I really have reached the point where I don't want to crawl on the ground or bend over to get in and out. And I didn't want to spend tons of money. This fit all my criterion. And stayed up with no problem during several wind and rain storms. (I did buy the fly, too) (And i used heavy duty stakes) Only wish it had a flap over windows or door so you could keep them open more than just an inch or two during rain storm. It would be wonderful to sit in this little cabin and look out at the rain.

It doesn’t seem to block sunlight any more or less than any other tent I’ve Owens over the years. Also, for its size, once folded and put away it still takes up a lot of space.

They also made the bag so you can remove the stitching and it will expand to hold the tent when you put it away.  You will need the rainfly and it does not hurt to seal the seams.

Instant tent is a good concept but poorly executed.1:The button that pops out when pole is extended to hold it in place works some of the time and I see this not lasting for years to come even if I didn’t have problems with mine out of the box.2: not having a separate rain fly means you will have to zip up windows in a rain storm which means your not getting much air flow and that one is on me I should have looked at the pictures more closely because I should have known that is not going to work in the south where humidity is horrible.

  Went to campground on Cape Cod with sunny beautiful days, cloudy days with drizzle and light rain and one day with torrential down pours.  Set up at 9:00PM with light rain and wanted to see how she held up. Had tent up quickly, didn't time it, but no issue.  Put tarp under tent. The issue came in when I realized how disorganized I was and couldn't find all the stakes.  Next time will separate all tent items from kayak gear. I staked out the tent and staked the rain fly the following day, there wasn't much wind so rainfly was secure enough with Velcro and snaps already on rainfly.  Opened vents at top center of tent and left open all week. Slept great - recommend large sleeping bag as it's just more comfortable with more room.  I'm 5'10"" and was great with inner cotton lining and was a coleman. Get the coleman tent kit with rubble mallet,stakes, small dust broom and collector - I used all of them. Didn't have any water or even condensation in the tent all week - not even a drop. Vents work great with rainfly and left open all week with no problems.  Tent was bone dry all week through all weather conditions. Stake all parts of the tent, stretch it out and stake front and back middle too.When no rain I left all windows wide open, wonderful air flow and great sleep.  Brought a few yoga mats, memory foam topper - worked great.  I think gel memory foam would even be better. Open door easily and when going around the corner just hold fabric behind and no issue.  If you take care of this tent it will take care of you. It takes a lot of stress out of camping.  Went back into bag easily, just leave windows open a few inches so air comes out of tent easily whenfolding up.  IMO, this tent is well made of good fabric, ridiculously easy to put up and take down and provides dry bug free living space.  Two people with all gear will fit comfortably or add a couple kids and will still work but you would have to be well organized.  I think this tent is an incredible value and remarkably easy to use.

  Was very excited when I got this tent for Christmas! The zipper on my previous tent broke. The set up & break down for this tent was really easy & quick. There's plenty of space inside. We had our queen sized air mattress on one side of the curtain divider and a camping chair & small table on the other side. We used this space to change clothes & put on our boots. It was tall enough for my 6’1"" boyfriend to maneuver around in. The hinge door on one side was so much nicer than just a zippered entry. Only needed to zip the bottom half to keep critters out. There is another zipper door on the opposite side. Love the Dark Room technology! Was able to sleep in because it actually kept the tent cooler during the late morning. But would need to test this out when the weather gets warmer. It's really dark inside at night so make sure you have a bright lantern.My one complaint is that it didn't hold up in the wind. We had steady wind at about 10-12 mph during the day & one side collapsed in, even with everything tied down. That was annoying. Not sure how it will hold up in the rain. Will have to update later.

  Super easy to set up this tent,  even alone.  Tent was completely staked-in under 5 minutes.I write this on my 5th night of a week long camping excursion.  So far,  so good.  Stayed warm and dry at night in 40 degree,  constant drizzle weather.  Lots of condensation on inside walls,  but stayed dry.  As the weather warmed,  it doesn't overheat,  vents well.  Strongly suggest you open inside windows about 4"" during the day to allow condensation to evaporate.  Also strongly suggest the optional rainfly. Offers added protection from the rain,  allows you to open side windows an inch or two for ventilation during a light rain shower, and rain-proofs the ceiling vent.Wouldn't want to attempt 4 in this tent.  2 adults with single air beds was cramped, but comfortable.

  It really does set up in 60 seconds, comes down in about 3 (including rolling and tying) and easily fits back into the bag.  The floor did develop two pinprick holes after setting up on a rocky surface, but they didn't let in water, even after a torrential downpour.  This tent stayed up under extremely windy conditions and in pretty extreme weather. Fantastic for touring when you're camping for only one night and moving on.  I'm really happy with this purchase!

  This tent will be going to it's 4th straight Burning Man next month. I was looking for a tent with fully closeable doors and windows. I can fit a full size cot, a huge cooler, and all my bags and gear in it.  Unless I keep the door open, the playa sand will not enter. Even in the harsh conditions and windstorms, I have never used any stakes, or rebar to secure it to the ground.  My gear is heavy enough to secure the tent. Totally recommend it, this tent rocks!

  The YouTube videos make it look ridiculously easy to set this tent up - it really is that easy. After 20+ years with an old-school Coleman tent, we wanted something that took a few minutes, not 20-30 minutes. We ordered this tent, and I set it up by myself in five minutes. Half of that time was spent thinking that there must be more steps before I started extending the four legs. We spent a night in a rainstorm without the rainfly, and it was fine. However, we're getting the rainfly for extra security. Packing the tent was almost as easy as setting it up. .  USER TIP: when taking down the tent, leave some screens partly unzipped, so the tent will pack down more easily. Cons: the door zipper is a single slider, not the two that every other tent has. If you have to get out in the dark, it's a hassle. We are very glad we got this tent.

    Leaks, no weatherproofing
  
",1.0,MamaBeaux,"Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2019","









  
  
    
  Such a good design with no weatherproofing. This tent is incredibly easy to set up but has absolutely no weather ability. The sides were wet to the touch, the pockets dripped water all night. The only reason we were able to stay marginally dry was because I threw a tarp over top when I realized we were about to be rained on. And that helped stop us from getting wet from above by morning all sleeping bags were soaked from the water coming in from the sides. The bottom did a fine job of staying dry though. But for the price of this tent and all that it is supposed to do, I would not buy it again and would not recommend to anyone.

    Tent camping in Our Seventies
  
",4.0,Careerman,"Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2019","









  
  
    
  We just spent three days in our new Coleman 6 person instant tent. No rain or strong winds so I don’t know about those conditions.  Overall I think it was a good choice.A few tips from the trip.  1. If you keep all the windows and door closed at night it will build up some condensation inside.  No drips but damp walls. 2. Use a tarp to cover the inside of the tent floor.  Kept the tent floor very clean.  3. When taking down the tent keep the four corners staked down. Fold the tent material into the center then take out the stakes and roll the tent.  4. Buy three or four cinch straps (buckles on it).  We got them at Big Five for $4 a pair.  These work much better than the ties that come with the tent.  They also help make the tent small enough to go back into the bag.

  If it sounds too good to be true, it is - I honestly thought I found a ShiftPod alternative at a fifth the price.  There were warnings of others who had the joint crack.  I thought I could do it right- the first three were great and the last snagged and cracked.  Three observations - first, the plastic is not up to the task.  A better quality reinforced plastic could be 3d printed so it means that Coleman chose not to use good quality materials in component that when fails results in a catastrophic failure.  Second, the floor was not waterproof - look at the second picture, right out of the box holes in the floor.  Third - a good design but poor quality materials.  I am going to replace the tent with another and invest in 8 muffler clamps.  They go on before the first assembly.Innovative design but POOR EXECUTION at least in my product.

    Easy to setup but can fall down easily too
  
",4.0,T,"Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2015","









  
  
    
  It is very easy to setup. But make sure you hold it up with ropes and place it in an area protected from wind.We got this a while ago and have used it quite often. It's very fast to setup but it really needs a locking mechanism on the top to keep it up. Once the wind gets above 15mph the tent falls down or completely collapses, quite often. I took this tent to central Utah and camped near Delta. The wind was pretty bad that night but I've always had good luck with our last tent we had. It was a small, cheap one. It held up great against the wind without using ropes. This Coleman tent fell down every time a gust of wind hit it. It got so bad that we abandoned it and slept in the car that night.It does work well at keeping out rain. The next morning we went out there and saw that it had collapsed and the rain had puddled on top of it. Amazingly, the rain did not get inside and it was completely dry inside of it. The windows zippers kept the rain out too but we had shut them before leaving it. It's easy to clean inside and out also. I usually bring it home, spray it out inside and also on the outside with a garden hose. Then I'll leave it to dry outside. It gets hot in Utah, and it's dry here so it really dries fast.One other drawback is that it is a bit heavy for a tent that size. Probably because of the metal support rods. It's not bad if you only have to haul it a few feet to a campsite but if you're going to backpack with this, it's a little heavy to lug around.Overall, it is a good tent but I wish it were more ""solid"".

  DOWNSIDES: one of our zippers came with the tag sewn in, so we had to trim it to even open the back door. also, the feature of a catchfree zipper is not true. it seemed to be more of a problem and one of the windows, the zipper was sewn too close and tight, if we use it frequently it is going to cause a rip. one of the exterior tags instantly broke because of stitcing but didn't leave a hole in the tent and we figured out how to fix it to accomidate and not make another hole. We had our first experience in this tent while camping out in the boonies in Western Oregon. It was very misty and foggy and the tent weathered well and left us dry, no condensation on the interior even with two adults and 3 mouth breather kiddos. The dark room feature was nice and let us catch some extra zzzz's. I would still recommend this tent, but if you are going to be frequent camping, make sure to check all zippers and seams with care. we were lucky and I don't think anything is going to cause a major malfunction.

  This is a very nice little tent for the money.  Easy to raise and lower.  Goes back into the bag well.  I ding it one star as I would have liked it to include a topper roof as most other tents do...doesn't seem like that should be an a la carte item.  Simply include it and charge accordingly.

The last thing I needed was one more thing to put together when on my vacation. This tent comes in a nice bag with fairly easy instructions. I'm not one for reading the instructions so I just took the tent out of the bag.

Yes this tent is really that quick to put together. another thing I really like about this quality tent is that you can stand in it. For one person you can put in a twin mattress and have room for a chair and a small table. If you are a couple we have put in at times a queen blow up mattress and still had room for a little side and table and that is for a 6 man tent.

  We pitched the tent with the added optional Rainfly on our back yard lawn which has about a 10 degree angle to the yard. Had it out there for 4 days with on and off rainfall that was pretty strong and lengthy at times and there was barely any water in the tent after inspecting the tent inside. Keep in mind that between the rainfall there was the strong sunlight hitting the tent and the tent got pretty hot inside with everything closed. With all the windows open the tent was cool and you still have some decent privacy with the windows open and some pretty good viewing through those windows. Pretty close to bone dry inside the tent for those four days of on and off rainfall. Wind max was about15 mph. Tent held up well. It was also super easy and fast to set up and to take down the tent. It took more time to peg the tent and rainfly then anything else. Pretty roomy inside, walls are nearly vertical when the tent is set up correctly and for such a low profile tent there is pretty decent headroom. We plan to get some use out of this tent. For the amount that we paid for the Tent and the Optional Rainfly we really can't complain at all. Happy :)

  This tent is easy and quick to set up, one of the easiest I have ever used.A couple of drawbacks is that it does NOT come with a rainfly.  IMO you should always use one and I purchased one directly from Coleman that fits this tent.  Also, I spent the time to water proof the tent with a spray and have had no water leaking issues.  Also, It says 6 person tent...I don't know how they determine that but I would not sleep more than 4 people in it. Six people would be absolutely crammed together. The walls are mostly vertical which gives you more room inside, but the trade off is that it will not do as well in high winds (for that a small dome would work better). I do think for the money it is worth it and a good buy as long as you understand the drawbacks.

    Just don’t make things like they use to
  
",4.0,DB,"Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2021","









  
  
    
  This tent is spacious, it does set up quick and is solid even in strong winds however ... the biggest concern I have is the quality.  They really don’t make things like they use to. Everything now a days is cheap quality.  The first tent we received was defective, one of the “fast release” legs was stuck.  Instead of being an instant tent, it turned into a 15 min battle to try to collapse one leg.  Glad Amazon sent us another right away.  Upon using our replacement tent (which came a different color from the 1st)  now twice we have noticed 4 holes in the fabric.  This is a huge disappointment considering this thing is brand new and not inexpensive.  My best advise is keep your old tent.

    small holes found on my tent

  Tent was as described. It opened and closed in a minute. Super easy to set up and take down, exactly what i was looking for when going camping with two under 2.  On my first trip, however, I did spot some areas on the floor with tiny holes and scratches. I had just bought this tent and even laid out a tarp to put the tent on to protect it. That's the reason for the low stars in weather proof and water resistance. Otherwise it got the job done and was quick and easy to set up. Only wish there was a bit more standing room, one more window, and something to tie the windows to when you want to keep it open.

    Good tent for the money

  Some have written about leaking problems.  The first time we used it we got caught in a short but heavy rain storm, but it did great.  Also tried spraying it with a hose--soaked it, but no leaking.  Although it does set up quickly, if you don't stake it down and there is any wind you will have problems.  We had 30 MPH winds one night and even though we had it full of gear it about blew over.  I think it moved about 6 inches during the night.  I wish there were more places to stake it down.  The bottom of the tent lifts of the ground on the sides which I think would not happen if you could stake it down in more spots.  You can only use stakes on the guy lines, poles and on two sides.  It would be nice to be able to stake it down on all four sides.  When we got home from out first trip and I was cleaning it out I saw a hole in the bottom (about the size of a penny).  I called Coleman and they are sending a new tent, but I take this as a sign it is bit on the cheap side.  I even put a tarp down underneath it when it was set up because I was worried about this.  So it might not be the highest quality, but it is an easy to set up, decent tent for $150.  Not bad in my opinion.  If I had $500 to spend I would get a nicer one, but since I don't this is a good tent for the money.

  It is insanely easy to set up. its awesome that you can stand upright in it. Take down is pretty easy too, just make sure to leave the windows at unzipped or else it takes a long time to deflate and pack up.I do NOT suggest using this if there is rain in the forecast. Water does indeed leak through the walls. We put the rain fly (bought separately) on and thought we'd be good. Don't get me wrong, the rain fly does a great job and keeps the ceiling dry, but below the area that the rain fly covers, the walls were dripping on us. Both times we've used this in rain, we've woken up in puddles with all of our gear soaked. I love this tent, and definitely recommend it,  just not for use in rain.One other thing I think is odd is that even though this sleeps 6 people, it still only has 2 pockets inside. You'd think more people, more pockets, but nah 🤷‍♀️.

  This is the perfect tent for me. I'm a 57 year old women who likes to camp. Although my old tent lasted a good long time, it was time to get a new one. I searched the internet and found some fabulous tents out there but kept coming back to this one. At my age the fact that it was supposed to be easy to set up was very appealing. It didn't have all the bells and whistles like some of the other new tents w/ their attached screen porches, electrical capabilities, many inside pouches, etc. but in the end I went with it. When I recieved it I immediately tried it out and bam! It went right up just like it advertised. I love the vents on top and the large windows all around. I also bought the rain fly and although it is smaller than I am used to, only covering the very top of the windows, it looks sufficient. I haven't had a chance to use it yet as we still have snow on the ground here, so I will update this later when I do use it. In the meantime, I will waterproof it as I always did with my other tent.  I also bought a piece of indoor-outdoor carpet for the inside (the same size as the tents footprint, 10'x9') and find that this helps hold the shape and makes it more comfortable. It is advertised as a six person tent. I will be very comfortable in there with my single size air mattress, my dog, my luggage and a small table and chair. There is still room for my young grandson who loves to join me. Happy camping!UPDATE: I used it four times this summer along with my dog and grandson. It was great! I highly recommend getting the indoor/outdoor carpeting. It made it much quieter and more cozy. Yes, it did rain and the rainfly was very sufficient. There were no leaks whatsoever.

  I did a ton of research on a tent my family could use. It was finally between this Coleman 6 person instant tent, the Coleman Sundome 6 person tent and the Red Canyon 8 person tent. After I was done reviewing all the tents, I made the decision to purchase the Coleman 6 Person Instant Tent because it was important for me that I can get the tent up and taken down quickly. I knew that if I had a tent that took a long time to set up and take down, it would make me less enthusiastic about using it.I was very happy when I received the tent. It's construction seems solid. After taking it out of the box, I decided to open the tent in my living room just to see how long it would take me to put it up. It took me about a minute to put up and 3 minutes to take down. I was able to use the tent the next night in our backyard and again, it seemed very durable and we had no problems. It did not rain and I did not get the rainfly so don't know how the tent would do in the rain.After taking the tent down, even though I did not do the best job rolling the tent up, I was able to place it in the carrying case with no problems because the case was pretty big. Would buy again.Overall, I am very happy with the tent. The instant nature of the tent allows me to set up the tent and take it down quickly without worrying that it will be a hassle.

  So I just received this tent. 4 person. No stakes luckily I have my old ones from my last tent. I set it up and there’s dead bugs in it. Cigarette ends “I don’t smoke so i don’t know what it’s called” there’s holes on the bottle floor of the tent. White stuff on the outside of the tent. I’m going camping in two days and was really looking forward to using this. However just from the way I received it I’m highly disappointed. Was this tent looked at before packaging??

  I've used this tent for two years now. I go camping nearly every month with the Boy Scouts. It's a little bit heavy, but for car camping it's great. It sets up so easily by myself and it's fast. It's been through heavy rain, wind, and snow storms and still is in great condition. I like that the bag has the expandable area sewn in to it because it makes it much easier to pack it away. The tent doesn't fold down super tight when it is cold, so that extra space is nice in those situations. Two suggestions, buy the rain fly not only for extra defense against rain, but also to keep the top of it shaded when you are camping for extended periods, and second buy some parafin wax and rub the zippers down to help them last longer. You won't be disappointed in this tent.

    Marriage saver, but has issues
  
",4.0,P. Buchanan,"Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2014","









  
  
    
  Very happy with this tent so far.  Easy to setup as advertised - me and my 11 year old set it up for the first time in 80 seconds.  Takes a few more minutes to tear down, but only because you have to wait for the air to escape as you roll it up.  HOWEVER it does have some negatives (otherwise I would have given this 6 stars if possible)I've had 2 issues so far listed below.CONS:1)  The bottom already has a few small holes in it from being adjusted after it was setup.  It did have sleeping bags already inside of it, but we do this all the time with our other tents that are 10 years old.  But we are talking pinhole sized holes, nothing major.  I saw them when hanging the tent up to dry before rolling it up.  But the floor material should be stronger.2)  The storage bag is large like they advertise - however, it's made of a very thin, weak material.  We have only used the tent 3 times and the bag has already ripped bad enough that we can't use it anymore.  Now we have to wrap it in bungee cords until I can find a bag large enough to store it in.  This almost cost this excellent product another star.PROS:1)  Sets up in a flash - even the kids can set it up themselves for a backyard campout2)  Breaths well3)  Makes the wife and kids are REALLY happy that we don't have to fight setting up the tent anymore (+++)4)  SturdyMIDDLE OF THE ROAD:1)  Price - seems a little expensive still2)  Rainfly - this should really come with one, and the option they sell is really overpriced (but I'll rate that one separately)OVERALL:I would still highly recommend this tent for people that want a quick-setup-marriage-saving-tent.  The cons can be fixed, and I hope that Coleman actually reads these comments.  Now I just need to find a decent canvas bag to store this in - that still irritates me.Thanks for reading!

  Great tent for a great price. Set up really is as quick and easy as described. Obviously this isnt for backpacking campers but is perfect for ""car camping"" and has a good amount of room. We set up a queen air mattress and our 1 year olds pack n play bed and it was a good fit. I definitely recommend also purchasing the rain fly to go with it which is equally as easy to clip on and is good security to stay dry. This was just our first trip with this tent and we had a modest rain pass thru one morning and the tent did fine and no leaks. Ultimately I know there are much higher end tents available but this seems to be a great tent to use with the family several times a year.

  I have been an avid camper for the past 32 years of my life and I have to say, this is the most disappointing tent I have ever owned. YES, it is incredibly easy to put up and take down and I do love that about it. What I don't love is that this tent, despite the words ""Weather-Tech"" emblazoned on the front of it, does not seem to have anything of the sort. I had read other reviews complaining about water leaking into the tent through the walls but I wasn't too concerned, as I don't camp when there is going to be rain. Well, let me tell you that rain is not required for this tent to leak. Even the slightest moisture in the air turns the inside of this tent into a shower that will wake you with drips and drops in the middle of the night. Yes, I read the review about buying seam sealer and I intend to get some. Even still, in my 32 years of camping I have never once had to weatherproof my own tent. Really disappointed considering Coleman is supposed to be a superior brand. I think I'll stick to Ozark Trail from now on.

  It’s my fult as I should have opened and checked the tent when it first came in in June 2019. But anywho took the tent camping recently fresh out of the box, and the tent wouldn’t stand. Come to find out from assembly where ever they put it together they installed one of the legs wrong. And to add the pad covering three of the joints looked rather used as if they were refurbished. When I did not and have never purchased a refurbished product without knowing it.We had a good camping trip over all, the tent never stood strait up and I had to keep adjusting the tent. Unfortunately I’m past the return time as I should have opened the box and put the tent up to check everything when it came in. But being that it’s suppose to be brand new and coming from Colmen I didn’t expect what happened to happen. So the moral is open the box take out the tent and pop it up and check it once you receive it.

  I loved this tent, it is extremely easy to set up, the entire process from unboxing to standing upright took about 4 minutes and a large portion of that time was spent inspecting the nifty bag it comes with, which has an extendable bottom incase you need extra room when putting it away. We did not need the extra room, as the tend folded up easily and fit back into the original size bag with room to spare. Taking the tent down and putting it away took less time than erecting it, and was so easy that I actually set it back up a second time to make sure I hadn't done something wrong (I hadn't, it was just that easy to put away!).This tent has only one door, which is not a double opening. At first I thought this would be a hindrance, however I wound up being very pleased as the door did NOT require using two hands and a pair of pliers to open or close, as so many tents do. The lack of the 'double-door' did not affect me at all, and I don't miss it. I would use this tent again and again, and I would recommend it for anyone, whether a first time camper or a seasoned one like myself.After being suspicious of the claims made in the advertising I was relieved to find that all were accurate.

I also bought the matching rainfly, and put it on the tent the first time, and was able to put that on by myself also. I've heard other customers mention they couldn't get the rainfly on by themselves, but I didn't have a problem. I am also six foot tall and wonder if that's my saving grace. I think it would be problematic if I was shorter. All in all, good tent. Love it!ps. I also camp with a queen-sized pillow top air mattress and the tent was the perfect size for me, my two dogs and all my gear.

  I have had this for 2 years now. I have used it for approximately 14 days of camping.Easy to put up and take down. 1 person can do it without trouble. It is a little difficult to fit in the carrying case but can be fully inserted. The carry bag is expandable if so desired making it very easy to fit in. The downside is the bag will be bulkier if this option is used.You do have to keep it vented on humid nights or condensation will develop. The abundance of windows is nice for this.The optional rain cover is a must! It should be included but isn't. BUY IT. You WILL need it in the rain.The floor is the basic tarp material so you will probably want to have a tarp or plastic under the tent.

  Review update!My wife and I just returned from a month in Yellowstone NP, The Tetons NP and Rocky Mountain NP. This Coleman Insta Tent performed great. We were in rain most every night. It never leaked a drop. And on several occasions we were in very high winds. Out tent again performed great. Not a single problem. I can highly recommend this tent. The best $$ I have spent in a long time.Very easy to set it up and to take it down.  But like anything the more you do it, the easier it gets. After about 2-3 times, you should be able to set it up in 1-2 minutes. The only negative is trying to fold it up tight enough to get it back in the bag. But even that gets easier. We have found that if we leave the windows and door unzipped (open) the air can escape and it will fold up better. My wife and I have been married for 36 very happy years, and rarely ever fuss and fight. But in times past while trying to set up other tents we would be at the point of wanting to sign divorce papers. But not with this Coleman Insta Tent. Marriage is bliss. I highly recommend this tent. Happy Camping all.

    Unexpected Failure

  I was super excited to buy this Coleman tent.  The last Coleman tent(Evanston Screaned) I bought lasted 6 years and survived many rain storms.  My only issue was that it took about 15 minutes to set up and when I go camping, I want to enjoy the camping experience as soon as possible.  At first the Coleman Cabin Tent lived up to expectations.  It took less then a minute to set up and had more than enough space for me, my friend , and dog(Totally about 500 pounds).  I was thrilled I got to enjoy the nice weather and boat around the lake.  Little did I know that my enjoyment would end the next morning.  Throughout the night there was light rain and puddles in the inside of my tent. The water was seeping through the walls.  I am totally shocked because this never happened with my old Coleman tent.  This almost ruined my camping experience.  I encourage anyone that buys this tent to buy a tarp for the top of the tent and bottom of the tent.  Get as many towels as possible, an extra bathing suit, and advil.  Coleman you can do better.

  I guess I’m a little salty because of the price (I found the same tent at Costco for $214 but didn’t buy it while it was there because I didn’t think I was going to be camping this year). This tent is an alright investment. It is pretty easy to assemble, it just opens kind of like an umbrella. We weather sealed it prior to our trip and compared to the people who were with us had much better results. The last night of the trip, we had a wicked thunderstorm, it was pouring buckets of rain and we only had a few tiny little puddles by windows and doors. The only part that I really didn’t like was the zippers on the doors. There are 5 zippers on the main door of the tent and only 2 of them open the tent. The tent does have a pole that makes the door open and shut like a real door so unless we were sleeping or there was bad weather we didn’t zip the tent. It was nice for sleeping in the morning so the sun wasn’t beating into the tent. Still got pretty warm in there though, lots of windows to open however.

  This is the best tent ever!My husband and I bought it for our first camping trip together and, of course, we got to the campsite way late (after 9pm) expecting to have to fumble around in the dark setting up a tent. It was dark, but setting up the tent (for the first time) was SO EASY! It went up in under a minute and we didnt have to figure out which pole went where! the best.The tent itself is spacious. My husband is 6'3"" and he was able to stand up inside the tent. We also fit a queen sized air mattress, our bags, and had room left over. (We are hoping this will be our tent for the future, AKA with kids)The only thing I wish we had done before setting up the tent was read the instructions on how to take it down. That process was also super simple once we read the instruction, but because we were just guessing (our bad) it was a little frustrating.I would buy this tent again in a heartbeat.

  This tent lived up to the billing - we initially tried it out in the driveway and it set up in less than a minute! There are just two of us and there is tons of room for our cots and porta-potty, as well as a couple of folding chairs if we want to stay inside.  Good-sized windows. Speaking of which, consider leaving a couple of windows open because we closed them all when taking it down and ended up with a huge, unfoldable bubble! One additional cool feature was a gusset in the carry-bag. It looks like a seam with white paper on the underside of the bag, but pull the white paper cord and you have all the extra room you need to put the tent comfortably back in the bag! We love it and can’t wait to actually camp in it!!

  I have been a huge fan of Coleman for many years! I started with the 12 person weather master, with the screen room. It withstood a 500 year flood that entailed a 2 foot river of water rushing around it, for hours. It did get water inside, which was 100% acceptable in such a freak of nature occurrence. We ended up having to cut a hole in the corner of the floor to drain the water out. It then stood until mid January (in Wisconsin) when 1 foot of snow and high winds FINALLY collapsed it. I then, (mistakenly) bought the 10 person weather master, which I didn't like at all! It was hard to anchor and stabilize. 1st rain storm, with high winds, flipped it upside down with 100's of pounds of camping equipment inside. Poles bent as well. This black out tent could be a bit more roomy, but seems very stable and I LOVE that it stays cool and dark all day long!

  when i saw it said the tent went up in one-minute, i laughed to my husband and said, well it'll take us at least a half an hour then.  But, it really did go up in five minutes or under! it's such a nice and simple design - all the poles just click right into place.  and it's nice and tall inside so you really can stand up and not hunch over the whole time.  we were very happy with this tent, and it packs up almost as fast as it opens up.However, it will absolutely not fit two queen mattresses as it claims, that is seriously laughable!  we purposely ordered this tent just for the two of us on a queen mattress and our little dog, so this is not a worry, but if you're trying to do really fit two queens or 6 people - consider a bigger tent.  With the one queen mattress we had enough space for our bags and a couple things which was nice and it felt spacious.  Our tent also came in orange and taupe, which is totally fine (i actually like it better than the blue and gray pic), but just something to note as well.one last thing to note, is that this tent does NOT pack small.  it takes up alot of room.  again, i knew i was trading easy for space on this one, and that's fine by me! but if you're looking for a tent that condenses down to not take up a lot of room in the car, it's another thing to take into consideration.overall we're very happy with the tent and can't wait to use it more!

Living in California, the lack of even water resistance wasn't as huge as a problem for us as it might be for others. We recently ordered another for family and the first time out both zippers on the door failed. Extremely cheap zippers that really aren't suitable for any tent. By the time we used it we had already passed the return date, so we are stuck with a $140 useless tent. Pay a little extra and buy something with zippers that won't self destruct.

    Awesome Car Camping Tent!

  I love this tent, it's definitely a car camping tent as it does not pack down small at all, but man, it's so easy to set up and take down! My tiny self can set up the tent and take it down in under a minute. I have had this tent now for over half a year and it has held up in the desert and mountains. I recently came back from the Sierras where we experienced a crazy hailstorm that lasted three hours (definitely get the rainfly!), with the rainfly and an added tarp as protection, the tent came out of the storm hole free! I'm about 5' 3"" and can stand up in the middle of the tent, no butt wiggling to put on pants! It comfortably sleeps three people, or two, or one, I can see four people being a bit cramped though. The only thing I would add on is a bottom window on one of the walls because it can get a little stuffy while sleeping, other than that this is by far my favorite tent. It's really not too hard to get it back in the bag either, which is awesome.

  The easy up aspect of this tent could not be better. Very spacious inside, the ""dark room"" technology really works. The ""main door"" is awesome-- doesn't require zipping all the time. The fly on top would be better if it extended a little farther... water does get in when you open the doors. That's a definite design flaw. It didn't rain a TON when we were camping, but if it did, I'd be less happy.

  Just used it this past weekend for the first time. Worked great, nice and big, and is as easy as they say to build up / break down.If I had any complaints it would be that the tent gets hot. There is a small rain fly on the top, but no real vents or ways for heat to escape. Only way to cool down is having all the windows unzipped. This works, unless you need to change, have adult time, or anything else that might need privacy (zipping up the windows) then it's going to get warm in there fast.Overall though for the price, size, and instant design you can't really go wrong with this tent.

    lightweight, but it doesn't leak!
  
",4.0,J L W,"Reviewed in the United States September 16, 2013","









  
  
    
  I have put up this tent and used it a few nights.  I liked the ease of putting it up.  I did it alone and it only took about 30 minutes to get it all spread out to get it staked and ready to enter.  The 60 second claim on the box is a bit silly.  But yes it is quick to put up.  Poles are all located on the outside as stated and only need to be pulled apart in the middle until they snap into a locked position.  That is it, the tent is up. Plenty of head room inside, which I really like, .  I did put one queen air bed inside.  Ahh, now that is camping.  Those are the pros of this tent.  The cons are it is a very lightweight material, and it does not come with a rain fly so that's why the low price.  I did order the rain fly which I have not received yet.  I would definitely not consider this a winter tent because the material is not heavy enough for that.,  So, if you only want to use it for a summer tent then there are no cons I guess.  That is my purpose for this tent but since it is late summer with rain forecast here, I did order the rain fly.  Oh, yes, their are one or two improvements that need to  be made on the inside of this tent.  The windows unzip from the top edge and sides and flaps hang down into room when tent windows are in the open position.  There are no ties to  roll up and secure the flaps, so they hang inward into the tent and over your face since the walls slant outward at the bottom.  Ties really are necessary.  Other improvement would be to add more storage pockets inside.  There are two very small, about 10""x10""  inside.  Only one hang ring up at peek of tent.  no other places to hang anything, since poles are all on outside of tent.  So you need to provide your own creative method of storing any small objects you do not want to loose track of.  Other than that, I am very pleased with this very roomy and very inexpensive easy to use tent.  I can't speak to whether it is water proof at all as I just got it and no rain yet.  I will update in a few days as rain is in the forecast for my area.UPDATEIt DID RAIN and quite a bit.  I was really surprised to find that no water got into the tent at all!  And I had not put the rain fly on yet.  So it looks to be a better tent than I thought.  It still is a summer tent in my opinion though because of the very light weight fabric.  But a great buy all in all.

  Start with the good. Easy set up and pack up. Enough room inside for queen and twin air mattress and dog bed with a little room left over to move around.Bad, not waterproof at all. Couldn’t handle light rain lasting 20 minutes.First time using it it leaked badly. Mid afternoon we set up the tent, with optional fly, then a little later it rained lightly for 20 minutes. We could see moisture coming through the walls below where the fly sits. Rain stopped, then later that evening started again, what I would consider normal rain, more than light but not heavy. Within 30 minutes there were small puddles of water in every corner and visible water drops coming through all walls.With the radar showing heavier rain lasting much longer than 30 minutes coming in the early hours of the morning, at 11pm we decided to pack up and head home wet and disappointed.Don’t know if we just got a dud tent, or if all are like this but we will be returning.

  They call it the Instant Tent and it truly is. I have fun dazzling other campers with the ease of putting it up. It really can be done in about a minute. The hardest part is driving in the tent pegs after the tent is up. It's easier than some umbrellas I've used. When we first purchased it, I was aware that tent seams can be a source of water leaks so I sprayed them with Camp Dry to prevent leaks. Even without a rain fly, it is water tight if you spray the seams a couple times a season. And wind? Not a problem so far. Sleeping in any tent in high winds is uncomfortable and annoying because of the noise and feeling of insecurity. Coleman can't do anything about the noise but the tent is a rock in some very high, sustained winds up to 25-30 mph. It shakes and shifts and rocks and rolls but it stays put and stays up. The frame mechanism seems very sturdy. We have spent two seasons in this tent in all kinds of weather and are pleased with it. The floor is the typical tarp polyvinyl material and seems durable enough but I like to use a ground cloth underneath just to prolong the tents life. If you are going to be in rainy weather a lot, I would get a rain fly but with Camp Dry on the seams we've stayed dry in some pretty good rain storms.

    Instant tent? Hold on a minute or 15 actually.
  
",4.0,John R. Vasquez,"Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2012","









  
  
    
  First you must remember that instant is a relative term. Is it easier to put up? Yes. Is it instant? No. I actually was able to put up my smaller tent with normal poles quicker than this one. You see one of the reasons it is faster up is that it has no fly. The fly can be bought separately and if you are ever in harsh weather I recommend it. If you add the time to put the fly on by one person this actually took me longer.Now that being said; if you want a nice sized tent that is easy for the non-experienced to put up this is a great tent. Roomy and tall. Height is something that many overlook. Standing up to put your pants on is a comfort that many take for granted until you can't. As for the foot print two things to consider. One, all tents are comfortable for exactly half of the number of people the manufacturer says it is for (Yes I said it. Hey I like room for my gear). So this tent is really comfortable for 2-3 people. Second, all tents have an angle. This makes them a bit smaller than their footprint would have you believe.Now for those who will say but John you seem to be saying that it is a good tent but that you don't like it for stuff that most campers know. My answer is yes.Bottom line on this tent. It is a good tent (with rain fly) for cool/ warm weather for 2-3 people who are not experienced campers. Easy to use and well built.If you are a hiker or even camp three hundred yards from your car then you will want to skip this. It is large and heavy and not really built for distance camping. Use it for family camping near your car and you should be very happy with it.

It is NOT a 6 person tent.  4 cots won't even fit.  3 cots work fine.

  When they say 60 seconds it is no joke,  It was easy to setup.  I like the cabin configuration.  Set up an air mattress and with the 9 x 10 dimension your head does not come close to the walls.  In subfreezing temperatures it is important so the condensation does not run down onto you.  For a guy like me, 6' 3"", a 7 foot tent is not long enough.

  This is my second Coleman instant tent. The first broke after 3 years (when I loaded it to some friends, not sure what happened). I camp alone so I need to be able to put up the tent by myself but I also like having the space for me, my dog and my instruments. I'm female and 5'7 and this tent is perfect, like a small bedroom rather than a tent. I got a generic instant tent at walmart to replace my broken Coleman and gave it away to a homeless man I met after using it once. Too hard for me to use when camping alone. Went back to Amazon and got the 4 person Colman, used it once and and then sold it to a friend get another 6 person Coleman tent. The 4 person was nice and fit my queen mattress but I love all the space I have in the 6 person tent. Never had issues with leaking rain but then again I generally camp in extreme weather other than high wind. Tons of room and it sets up in under 4 mins with only one person - which is the main reason I got it. Breaking it down and fitting it back in the bag is a bit tricker but you get the hang of it. Do not remove the poles - ever!! They are meant to stay in. I know a few people who have tried and it ruins the tent. IThere is no rain fly yet somehow the vent system does not seem to get water or dew inside under non-extreme conditions (I can't speak for harsher weather). I will probably never buy a different brand of tent.

  I took my first camping trip alone with my 2-year-old and 2 dogs earlier this year and needed all new camping gear since I had never been camping in a tent as an adult.  When I saw the instant tent I knew this was exactly what I needed!  I was nervous about camping alone with my 2-year-old and dogs, especially with how long it normally takes to set up a tent.  When we got to our campsite I left the car running with my son and dogs in the tent and had the tent up in about a minute!  It reminds me of setting up my son's playpen.  Taking it down was easy too, though fitting it in the bag was a little tricky, but isn't that how it always is??  The downside to this tent is, as someone else mentioned, when the windows are opened all the way there are no ties to tie them back.  If you don't get them tucked in just right they fall in your face when you are lying on an air mattress.  With a 2-year-old in the tent jumping around and looking out the windows it was next to impossible to keep the windows tucked in just right.  I'll agree with someone else who said they don't think 6 people could fit in this tent too.  I had a queen size air mattress and a kids aerobed in the tent and there was about a foot and a half of space between the 2 matresses, though we did have some space for the dogs at the foot of the kids aerobed.  If everyone was sleeping on sleeping bags with no air mattresses, perhaps you could fit 6 people in there.  But I don't know anyone who camps without an air mattress or cot!  Next time we go camping I'm taking my twin size air mattress instead of the queen - I accidentally grabbed the wrong one last time - so we'll have more space to move around in the tent.

You can definitely fit two Queen air beds in this thing, but that is all you have room for so it may be worth paying a little bit more to get the 8 person tent so you have a bit more place for bags, etc!

  I love Coleman products for the most part, however this was an utter disappointment. Used it for 3 days total. The tent leaked like a sive after only a few hours of rain. The condensation built up within hours and combined with nonstop rain for a few hours the inside of the tent was dripping everywhere. I've never had any tent leak this much. My sleeping bags and clothing were drenched, not to mention when I slept I had to deal with water dripping on my face.

    Coleman 6 Person Instant up Tent

  My husband & I put this tent up and took it down right out of the box in 3 minutes, and were very surprised at how EASY it was. We will be using it over Thanksgiving @ Campland on the Bay in San Diego. During our practice run it really felt like the right size for us and has plenty of room for extra stuff. Not sure I would want 6 people in it but can surely see that if they were not too large it could be accomplished.  We will really really love the ease in putting it up and taking it down.Ok so Thanksgiving was this weekend and we used the tent for the 1st time. Others that were with us loved the ease it went up & down with.My suggestions are the following:Material used on the top portion is very light in color, making the tent very bright at night. I don't think we had a full moon but for me it was way too bright inside.Has only 2 little pockets to hold items and they are on total different sides of tent. I would appreciate 2 on each side of the tent so we could each have a place to put our things.Laying on our air mattress I had to get up & out of bed to unzip the windows so I could peek out and see what the day looked like. They only flap down from the top and have no ties.Being on the Bay we had moisture in the air and the tent seemed to hold tht so when I got up the sides got me wet.Had only one qn air mattress and any more would have been a tight squeeze.So since we have experienced this tent I think we might return it for a different one and will also change my rating for this item.The best thing about this tent is the ease of assembly.

  I have enjoyed this tent now for two years. It definitely does not need the additional rain fly -- at least for weather typical to the southeastern US. Rain storms are not a problem for this tent. I love how roomy it is, perfect for two people who like a lot of room. I love not crawling, but walking into my tent. This was the reason I invested in a larger tent and I have been satisfied on this point. I have been extremely happy with how easy this tent is to set up and break down, literally taking less than five minutes for one person. That being said, I have two complaints about the design: the door zipper requires you to bend down each time to unzip, which is tiring; the windows do not have ties for the window covers, however the fabric will tuck neatly between the screen and window fabric if you do so carefully. Otherwise, the windows hang at a funny angle when unzipped all the way. Overall, I would look for a door that unzips differently, but the tent is great for what it does.

  Lovely tent. Goes up fast.  I don't know why it doesn't come with a rain fly. Yes, I bought the one that goes with it. The rain fly is a must-have item. My first trip in this tent was in flood conditions and everything inside stayed dry.Coleman customer service was good on the second try.  The first try the line went dead like they hung-up on me.  I hope it was just a cell-phone issue.  I managed to break a screw putting the tent away in a thunderstorm.  They don't sell the screw so they offered to replace the tent with a new one.  I found a piece of welding rod that will hold it together until I find the right screw.

    Overall very good tent, but a couple of significant cons to consider
  
",4.0,Chessie612,"Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2012","









  
  
    
  I bought this tent after seeing it at the campgrounds and reading about the ease-of-use. I have a smaller, cheaper (not Coleman) tent that has been great! It's waterproof, and I can easily set up and take down by myself in about 10 minutes. But I wanted a larger option that I can stand in.Pros:1)  Super, super easy to put up and take down. I'm a 5' 4"" female and can do it alone in under 5 minutes.2) I like that it has windows on all sides, providing good ventilation.3)  Great height and size. I can stand up in the tent, or even bring my beach/camp chair inside in the evenings or if it's inclimate weather outside. Big enough to share with one other person, our airbeds and bags. (6 ppl is out of the question!)4) Large doorway you can walk through without crouching5) There are two large pouches inside about mid-high to store small items so they don't get lost in the tent. And there is one loop in the center of the ceiling that lanterns, etc. can be hooked from if you have the right hook or bungee.Cons:1)  It most certainly is not waterproof, despite what anyone may try to tell you. Don't believe them!2) Rainfly.  It doesn't come with one, but even with the fly, which I ordered and waited four months for, it is not rainproof.  The sides seeped significantly because the fly only covers the top. It should come down lower, at least on three sides. It would also have been nice if they designed it with a vestible over the door since the walls of the Instant Tent slant outwards.3) The door zipper!  This is one of my biggest issues with the tent! The zipper for the door starts/ends at the bottom corner, instead of the top corner. This is an issue for convenience and bugs. There is a small gap even when it is fully zipped, and because it's at ground level, this will allow in bugs. Coleman should know better than this. And to just stick your head out you have to unzip the whole darned door. Not convenient!4) The windows are too high. I would prefer at least one of them to be a little lower to provide additional airflow and a view. The entire back of my smaller tent is mesh, which is great in the summer or for star-viewing at night.5)  Despite the ads, there is no way two queen mattresses will fit in this tent. And it will not fit 6 people without someone smothering.6)  It's heavy, but that's because of the structure required to make it so easy to use. No way I can drag this too far. But the bag is sturdy and has good handles, so it's easy to haul.7) It would be nice to have more than just the single loop in the middle of the ceiling. My smaller tent actually has four.Bottom line: it's a great tent for good weather, but don't expect to have a view from inside or to stay dry if there is more than a drizzle, even with the rainfly. However, I'm going again this weekend and will be using waterproofing spray on the whole tent. We'll see if that makes a difference.

    Nice tent - more durable than most
  
",5.0,BAS,"Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2012","









  
  
    
  Nice tent and fairly easy to setup the first time without anything more than briefly glancing at the instructions.  It did require an extra pair of hands to hold two of the four legs steady while the other two were unfolded.  It took around two minutes to assemble the first time and I believe it'll go much faster the next.  This is not a ""trail"" tent and would be somewhat heavy to carry around if hiking hours at a time.  The material is much thicker and construction more durable than a trail tent. This together with the provided tent hold-downs (aka tent stakes and attached cords) should standup to windy conditions very well.  Others have commented about a ""spider hole"" that remains by the door zipper(s) not closing to within each other.  This is not true.  If you close the zipper on the upper portion of the door first and bring it all the way down to the floor ""then"" follow this by closing the lower zipper it will meet the upper zipper to within 1mm (we measured this).  We noticed a slight problem with the design in that this tent lacks a rain fly.  The rain-fly is supposed to divert ""some"" of the rain from the main body of the tent.  However even though Coleman now sells a rain-fly someone on this blog suggested (we believe) a better solution - purchasing a 9'x10' tarp.  At night the tarp can drape the entire tent providing rain protection.  During the day the tarp could be detached from the back poles, flipped over and with a couple of extra poles made into an awning over the front doorway.  The tarp then, while not as form fitting as a Coleman rain-fly, can serve double duty.Overall good purchase - glad I bought it.

  My tent came with no stakes. Luckily, I had some on hand, otherwise, I would have been pretty upset. Another problem was with the zipper to the door. It was messed up on the curved part of the door and was almost impossible to close at times. My 10 year old could barely do it. I would have to pull both sides of the door together just to get it to zip and even then it was very difficult. I do have to say that this tent held up well through several thunderstorms, but I did have the rain fly on it to help. I purchased this tent specifically because it was Coleman brand. I had certain expectations and was let down. I am trying to figure out how to get this situation resolved as I should not be responsible for shipping it back, but nor should I have to struggle with the zipper every single time I go in and out of the tent. I would buy this tent again, but check for stakes and check the zipper before camping.

It will sleep 4, comfortably, if you sleep on the ground. It will sleep 2 and a dog it you sleep on cots.

  I do not leave comments often, usually others' comments provide enough information.  In this case, I just could not let it go.  The tent sets up very quickly, even if there is wind and you are attaching the fly (separate purchase).  Its height and dimensions make it ideal for limited tent pads you sometimes encounter at parks.  However, I strongly recommend only using this tent when you know there will not be rain, like for a sun shelter at a track meet.I seam sealed the tent prior to use and took it to the mountains for camping.  It leaked SIGNIFICANTLY.  I've never been in a tent that leaked so prominently through the walls, even when we we very careful to not make contact with the inside walls.  Even after using 3M tent waterproofing spray and and a mild rain, there were puddles of water on the inside floor--and this occurred when the tent was empty (we were testing it for another trip and left it set up overnight).  Perhaps if the fly were larger then water would not drip as much on to the screens, we think that is one weakness for the leaks.  However, we saw water seeping through the material of the surfaces along all surfaces away from the windows.

  The size is perfect for a family of 4 with two kids. You could fit two queen size air bed but it leaves you with a small space to walking around and also less space for your bags. Their is no spot to run the power outlet inside other than running it in the door it self. I don't suggest putting any electronic or anything that you don't want to get wet in the build it pocket inside the tent. The moist that builds inside the wall tend to drip inside the pocket. Pay attention on the folding mechanism since it almost broke my finger when I was trying to relocate the tent. The tent is a little heavy and also longer when folded down compare to my old tent that folds in much smaller. The take on this is, instant tent equal longer and heavier. To be safe, I ended up buying the rain fly which help in making the tent a little harmer. I like the little vent on top and the hook in the top middle to the tent is nicely build and I'm sure it could hold a heavy light or a fan for ventilation. The tent does not have anything build in to hold the window flap when it is open so when you have the windows flap is open, it just hang inside which is a little un organize. The only one that has it is the door screen alone which is guess a plus. For the price I got it which was on sale and the quality you get for it being ""Coleman"" I would give it 7 out of 10 due to missing outlet port, missing window flap holder, pocket inside getting wet due to condensation and the water tend to drip inside the pocket, the folding mechanism that almost got me which is partly my fault. Thank you Amazon for the great product and price. No more late night setting of tent that normally takes me 20 or more minutes while raining.

  This tent is very easy to set up and put away and makes a great ""guest"" room or slumber party space. Put up cousin Bill in the backyard and reclaim your sofa or home office!I recently stayed two weeks in a relative's backyard using this tent, and was quite comfortable. It had ample room for myself, my gear and my dog. It would be very comfortable for two adults, two kids and their gear. I was staying in fog-bound coastal northern California, and stayed dry in the tent despite daily nightime fog and light rain. The evening temps dropped below 50F a couple of nights (in July!) and under those conditions there was light condensation in the tent in the morning even though the rooftop vents were kept open.It's been several decades since I've slept in a tent that I could stand up in, and I have to admit that it's nice. That being said, I wouldn't use this particular tent under high wind or stormy weather conditions; a lower profile tent with a full coverage fly will do better in those situations.I bought this tent with the intent of leaving it with my relatives as a gift for them when I left town. Unfortunately, the lower front door zipper broke three days into my visit, and I'll have to negotiate directly with Coleman for repair or replacement of the tent. This is why I'm giving the tent a four star rating. I applaud Coleman for the instant tent feature, and hope that they can extend it to tents designed for harsher weather conditions.Comments added on 8/11/2012:After speaking directly with the helpful folks at Coleman I realized that I had two options for getting a replacement tent. I could go through Amazon (which required returning the original tent to Amazon), or I could provide Coleman with several pieces of electronic documentation (including a photo of the original tent marked up with permanent marker with a code provided by them) and they would review my documentation and ship me a new tent. I opted to go the Amazon route and am one happy camper (pun intended). As soon as I filled out the return info online, Amazon shipped a brand new tent to my relatives. It was received by them in two days(!). Meanwhile, I went to the UPS store and had them pack up the original tent (I'd tossed the box already) and send it back to Amazon. It cost me about $11 for the package and packaging to return the tent, but it was worth it to get the speedy shipment of the new tent. Thanks Amazon! (I'm a member of Amazon Prime, which probably played a role in the quick delivery of the new tent).

It has no fight in it.Because it's a pop-up the tent bag is quite long, so it's not the space saver that traditional tents are, but if you have the room it'll save you so much time.Also, there's plenty of setup and take-down videos on youtube so you can learn in advance.

  Just delivered yesterday so I haven’t taken it out yet, hoping to this weekend. Initial impressions: Super easy set up. I did notice that the space between poles doesn’t really stretch out so there seems like a lot of extra floor material and like my other tent, it doesn’t have the hoops to steal that space down. I think the excess fabric may be reduced when staking the corners down but pulling the corners out didn’t really seem to do anything. Take down Was easy. I was a little disappointed by the sloppy fold up. Maybe I will find a way to make it a bit nicer with some practice.

If I didn't have the top, it may not handle heavy rain well, as it does not have a rain cover. Plenty of room (I have the 6 person one, I had tried the 4 but a larger queen mattress (height) doesn't fit will in the 4), and very well ventilated, so air moves well and doesn't get overheated in there.

Coleman Rainfly for Coleman 6-Person Instant Tent









  
  
    
  First, let's start out by stating this is not a 6-man tent.  I can see 4 people, and for me (a trailer camper), that's pushing it.  We basically use it to sleep in, with two blow-up mattresses, and there is about 1-2 feet between them.  That being said, let me state the following about the product:a.  Yes folks, it really does go up that quick.  I put this thing up (minus staking down) in about 1 minute the FIRST time.  I just watched the video on Coleman's site and did it.b.  Yes folks, it really comes down that quick.  You just fold it up, and roll it on the ground (just to wrap it up), and it goes right back into it's carrying bag, which is nice and sturdy and has the clasps to keep the bag from wripping.c.  It has nice windows and a breathable top (meaning it has two ""popup"" vents, that use reinforced velcro ""stands"" to pop them up).  The windows are huge, and every wall has one.  They zip from top, down, so if you only want them part way, you just unzip, and fold the unzipped part back into the window.d.  The door is a ""D"" shape, and seems to work really well.e.  I had read on review's that you have to seal the seams, so we did (My wife did it in about 30 minutes or so using the coleman seam sealer).  Didn't spray seal the roof because of condensation issues and instead bought the rain fly.f.  The floor is bathtub design, meaning it extends up the sidewalls about 3 inches, keeping water from coming in.g.  The walls are supposed to be 3X the thickness of regular tents, can't say for sure it is, but they seem thicker to me.h.  Because the tent is completely attached to the poles, which literally just pop out and up, there is nothing to do but stake it down -- great for me since I have to spend that time fighting with the shower tent...(That's another story)i.  The rain fly - I bought it cause the reviewers kept saying you will need it.  However, I have the following remarks on it:  1 - If it  is needed, why didn't Coleman include it with the tent (at a slightly higher price)  2 - It is nothing like the rain fly on the oversea's model of the same tent (This one does not even extend over the windows, so you wouldn't be able to have the windows all the way unzipped in a rain storm)  3 - I cannot attest on it's performance, as I received it after our first trip (these things must be high-demand and backorder from Coleman)...however, I sprayed water on it and it beaded right off - good sign!  4 - Just like the tent, it goes on QUICK.  You just unfold it over the tent, and it has built-in straps that clamp (by pushing them)onto the poles...had it on in <1 minuteMy experience with the tent is very small, one trip overnight; however it was very good and I have no qualms about the tent (other than what I stated above)...It seems to be high quality construction, and again, it goes up and tears down FAST!  You will be very very pleasantly surprised by that part, and it was a HUGE selling point for me...I will update this review after 22 Oct 2012, as we are camping for 3 nights in Chimney Rock, NC[...] to see the fall colors...I also want to see how my complete rig works (camp shower with propane water heater, camp toilet, etc)...will update when we get back...

  Have used this tent for 2 years along with the rainfly (sold separately) for car camping (you know where you drive some where like a campgrounds and camp near your car). Still no leaks, still super easy to put up. This year I even put it up completely in the dark and was fine.  I've been through some heavy downpours with it and the bathtub sides mean no leaks even with my queen size air mattress butted up right against the sides of the tent.Also it says it fits a queen size air mattress and it does BUT there isn't a ton of other room in the tent if you have one in there, just to let you know.

  _  The tent is extremely simple to setup and take down - even for one person. There is no pinching of fingers when pressing the buttons to take down the legs. It easily zips back into the convenient storage bag with handles,  with enough room to put a few other items like a tent light and the

  ._  It is possible to change in a bent over position but only young children would be able to stand up straight in the tent. As always with the sizes on tents - this four person tent is more like 2 with an queen sized air mattress or 3 with foam mats and then room for your day packs and walking space. The tent door zipper opens and closes without any catches._  There is little need to use the guy lines as the tent maintains good tension against the frame in normal breeze conditions. There is a nicely small covered vent at the top that can be adjusted from within the tent by opening a zipper. The window openings attach at the bottom so they can be opened a little across the top for light venting or opened fully and tucked into the bottom for a 3-sided cross breeze.

  I've used my Coleman instant tent several times this season. I did apply seam sealer and sprayed it down with silicone before first use. It certainly is easy to put up and down. I like the squared shape, allowing for head room. It is plenty roomy for me and my stuff, and I think would accommodate 2 people easily. I also have the rainfly (sold separately for $39.99 outrageous in my opinion). It should be included. Tent easily managed light rain on and off. The final trip was a downpour! 4 days and 3 nights with constant heavy rain, with thunder and lightening and downpours. I truly thought I'd be washed off the mountain 2 of those nights. The tent did not leak, by the 3rd day however, it was very damp inside. The rain fly hugs the sides of the tent too closely. This does not allow for having the windows open for air circulation. More importantly, it hugs the door, which encourages run off onto the door. A redesign of the rainfly, that would include fixed style awnings over the windows and doors would be a terrific improvement.

  The ""1 minute setup time"" might be an exaggeration... It's more like 30 seconds. This tent is seriously awesome. There are only two negative things I can say about it.1. It does not come with a rain fly.2. When it's packed away, it's still huge.But honestly, if you're car camping with the family, who wants to camp in the rain anyways? Also, you probably are going to have a ton of other stuff taking up room in your Prius anyways, so the large dimensions don't really matter that much.I really like all the venting and the interior height. I'm 6'1"" and I can stand up fully inside the tent. It's a super nice feature that I've never experienced before. Normally I have to bend over at the waist and fall directly onto my face while I change into my pj's at the campground. Never again!

  Ok so this instand-up tent is truly ""instantly up"" in less than a minute.The problem is getting it packed back up.  Due to the frame being attached to the tent, it doesn't fold in the traditional sense.  You have to more or less roll it up and 'stuff' it back in the bag, which I warn you is about 3 times as big as a normal tent and yes - that causes wrinkles.  I have yet to use the tent so I will save the rest of my review until afterwards, but I want to let people know that this tent's stored state is very large.  Otherwise, very pleased so far.Update:  Used the tent two or three times and I am completely satisfied and somewhat impressed with this tent.  This past weekend rain started at around 9pm, rained all night with no breaks whatsoever and into the next day until 10am when we took it down.  I did not notice a drop of leaking anywhere, during 13 hours of constant rainfall.  I do have the optional rainfly.  Granted there was no wind and the rain was 'moderate', but for the price and size of this tent it did great.  The only complaint I have is the severe condensation (due to the tent's waterproof, non-breathable fabric and wet conditions).With all this taken into account, I do not like the way it packs up.  You more or less just wad it up and cram it into the bag.  It just doesn't sit well with me.  I believe I'm going to sell it and get a tent I can fold up neatly and store in a more civil manner.  If the sloppy storage and weight does not bother you, this is a great tent.

    Weathers the Storm!!!
  
",4.0,B. Grayless,"Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2011","









  
  
    
  I live in ""Tornado Alley"" in the Midwest, Kansas City area. If you don't know, we get some of the worst possible thunderstorms here that you could possibly imagine. 80+ mph winds, torrential downpours, low and VERY LOUD thunder and lightening. It feels like the roof of your house is going to blow off, as it creaks and moans the entire night during the storm.We had one of these storms this past weekend, and I was camping in it with two of my little girls. And of course, I had my Coleman Instant Tent on it's maiden voyage. I knew we'd have bad weather, so I set a heavy duty tarp under the tent, partially to keep the water away from the tent, but also to protect the tent floor from wear. It was a typical hot and sticky midwest summer evening. Then about 2 AM, the winds came howling in at gale forces of 50 mph (according to the weather service), followed by EXTREMELY loud and heavy rain and thunder. The wind was blowing so crazily that it was hitting the tent from every different direction. Not one square inch of the tent exterior had any chance of staying dry. The rain and thunder continued for the next 5 or so hours with continued moments of VERY heavy rain and winds.I am very pleased to say that we stayed totally dry and the tent incurred no damage from the storm. The also brand new tent (of a different Coleman model) of my friend who was next to us caved in on him and his kids at some point during the night (although he did stay dry). This Instant Tent turned out to be a great investment.PROS1) Easy setup... almost too easy. ;)2) This tent weathers the storm!!! Remember, there is no fly on this tent, which is a great convenience for setup. But Coleman makes up for it with it's great seams and stronger material on this tent.3) Very spacious with lots of head room.4) Strong, well stitched material.5) I like to take my tents home and put them up again so they will fully air dry before putting them away. The setup of this tent is so easy that it makes this very convenient.6) It's much harder to lose parts on a tent that is already put together.CONS1) I've been involved in the Boy Scout program for decades and I've used my share of tents. This tent is sturdy, however, I can see how certain facets of the construction might not last through heavy regular use. For example the extension of the poles causes some wear on the painted surface which could cause rust. Certain critical parts of the poles and pop-up mechanism are plastic which I could see being points of failure after usage in several heavy storms or really cold weather. I can even see kids not caring for the mechanism as they should during setup and take down. However, don't let this deter you from this tent. The tent needs to be made of lighter parts in order to provide the convenience that makes this tent attractive. However, if you are planning on using this as your primary tent and/or use it quite often, keep this in mind. In my particular case, I have several tents, but wanted one that was spacious and easy to setup for quick overnight trips... This tent is perfect.2) The bag that holds this thing is HUGE. I figure it's about twice the size (lengthwise) of a regular equivalent sized tent. This is expected because of the heavier material and the way the poles need to be constructed for the pop-up mechanism to work. This isn't a terrible thing, just don't expect it to be a small bag.I would buy this tent again.

  We bought the 6 person tent for car camping and really wanted something that was easy to setup and take down, and would have plenty of room for our queen size air mattress. This tent really is extremely easy to use. It rained a little bit on our first day camping and we didn’t have any issues with leaking just a bit humid inside the tent. Make sure to buy the rain fly sold separately. We read from another reviewer that it helps to keep the windows partly open when rolling it up to let the air out, this tip worked really well and it probably took less than 2 minutes to take it down and have it in the bag.

  SET UP: Seriously easy to set up.  I am a five foot tall woman and the tent is taller than me.  I bought this tent after watching a few Youtube videos showing the set up and take down.  I could seriously set this up with my eyes closed having done it just once.TAKE DOWN: it takes longer to get this tent into its carry bag than it does to set it up or take it down.  To be honest, I failed on my first attempt at rolling this into its bag.  Currently the tent is in my car half in and half out of its carrying bag.QUALITY:  I like the overall quality but am concerned a little that the zippers around the windows/netting may tear.  The zippers are solid and maybe more so than the plastic netting that they are sewed into.  This is my one concern.  Some of the zippers are sticking too so I might spray them with a little spray oil.STORAGE BAG:  I think Coleman needs to give us a break and create a bag that balloons a bit and makes it easier to pack.  While I appreciate a bag, I'm considering finding or sewing another that will make it easier for me to pack the tent into.

    BEWARE OF DUCT TAPED FLOOR CORNERS!!!
  
",2.0,Barbara A.,"Reviewed in the United States October 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  Easy setup as stated, BUT we did not realize until the end of our second week camping that three (3) inside corners had DUCT TAPE on the floor!!  I thought we had purchased a NEW tent!  Two outer sides have no tie down cords (see photos)...and finally, the rain fly is an EXTRA PURCHASE!  You stay 100% dryer with a regular tarp that can/will: (a) be cheaper; (b) provide overall excellent covering and (c) offer total protection when weather goes damp on you.

    Yes, it's that easy
  
",5.0,Annabanana,"Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2012","









  
  
    
  I haven't camped in at least 20 years and had a husband to set up the tent back then.  I'm now in my mid-50's and a solo camper with little to no patience for putting things together.  I was very skeptical when I saw the reviews about how easy this tent is to set-up. On a leap of faith I took it on my first camping trip, arriving just before dusk hours away from home, and with a backup plan of sleeping in the car.  I was amazed that it took less than 5 minutes to get it out of the carrying bag, read the instructions and put it up.  Taking it down was just as easy. Getting it back into the sack was the hardest part, but still less than a 10 minute task all totaled from take down to zip up.I agree with the other reviewers that you would need to be very chummy with the 5 other people you share this tent with, and you'd all have to be pretty skinny. I'm average size with 2 60 pound dogs and it felt just right with all the stuff I want to keep inside the tent (bag of clothing, lantern, radio, etc.  It's rooming enough to stand in and has 2 pockets to keep your ipod, bottled water for easy reach.  The zippered windows are great to allow air circulation.  I didn't have a problem that there was no way to tie down the flaps; like other reviewers I just tucked them in the window ""sill.""If you're looking for a basic roomy tent that's SUPER easy to set-up and take down, I highly recommend this one.

  I set up this tent the moment I received it because I knew it was going to rain that weekend. It took me about 5 min to do it by myself, I think I can get it done a bit quicker next time. The tent is big my family (4) has plenty of space, 6 people will fit but it might be crowded.The material is water resistant, not water proof. It rained hard for about 30 min and water did go in, a few drops toward the edges of the floor (not at the center of the tent). I might not have done the best job setting the tent, I probably need to stretch the the a bit better. When it rained  water accumulated at the bottom of the sides where the tent was wrinkled and s few drop came in.I wish that wasn't the case but other than that I have no issues with it. I'm happy with my purchase.UPDATEThe tent is heavy... i went  camping where i had to walk 30 min up and down zand dunes to get to the campsite... and its no fun to  carry (its 20 pounds) plus i had to carry camera gear and other stuff. If you only carry the tent it may not be thag bad but consider howfar you need to walk. If you camp close to your  car its perfect!

  Taken this tent out in the summer, pouring rain in the fall and ensured some pretty high winds.

  Looked at the Coleman and Ozark Trails 6-person instant tents.  Decided to go with the Coleman.  The poles were thicker and the tent fabric was twice as thick.  Coleman says the tent is water proofed and no rainfly is needed. After reading reviews I decided to get the rainfly.  Set the tent up in the garage before our camping trip and was amazed at how fast and easy it goes up. I put seam sealer on all seams of the tent and rainfly then water proofed them both as well.  Any time you sew two pieces of cloth together with a needle there will be small holes and the seam sealer takes care of that issue.  I do not trust the factory workers in China to water proof the tent as well as I would.  All the extra effort paid off on our trip as it rained one night and we were dry as a bone.  The tent will sleep 3 people comfortably and 4 if you like each other.  We put 2 king sized cots in the tent and had enough room to stand up walk in the center of them.  There is plenty of head room all around.  I'm 6'3"" and had no issues. The windows are large and let in lots of air and there are 2 vents in the top to let hot air out and cool air in when the windows are closed. (very nice feature)This is a great tent and I would recommend it to anyone.

  Had a good soaking rain with some leaks around the bottom seams where the floor connects to the walls.  I sprayed some water-guard around the seams.  That worked.  Quick and easy to put up.  Sturdy.  Plenty of windows. Could use a slit for an electric cable.  The tent storage bag is wide enough, but it could be a little longer.  Doesn't come with a rain fly.  Because the bottom angles out from the top, water will come in when you open the door in the rain.  You will want to get something for that, but not the rain fly Coleman makes for this tent.  It just covers the top of the tent.  Overall, I like it.

    Best Tent Ever!!!
  
",5.0,CPT G,"Reviewed in the United States March 23, 2014","









  
  
    
  I purchased this tent about two weeks ago and went on a Boy Scout camping trip with my son's troop this weekend.  We arrived at our location about 9:30 pm.  It was pitch black, I never read the instructions, and just like the You Tube videos, had this erect within less than a minute.  I was absolutely delighted with it.  Having read previous reviews, I did purchase the rain fly.  We had some significant wind gusts reaching 40 mph the second night of camping and the rain fly partially blew off.  (my fault for not staking it down, not an equipment issue.)  I also learned that when taking the tent down, it is important to unzip the door to a significant degree, so that the air can be pushed out of it.  It took me 2 - 3 minutes to break it down with the wind blowing, as I struggled to get the air pushed out of it.  I was able to easily roll it up and get it back into the bag.  We had a few sprinkles but no significant rain over the weekend, so comments on that will have to wait for the future.  Overall, this was the best initial experience with a tent I have ever had.  The overall ease to put up and take down was phenomenal.  While this is described as a 6 person tent, if your using cots, you could comfortably fit three in here.

    Best Tent Ever; crummy carrying bag
  
",5.0,Smiling Sunshine,"Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2012","









  
  
    
  This is the best tent ever! My husband and I are both blind and still managed to have it set up in less than 2 minutes straight out of the box without looking at the directions. It's really that easy.When we went camping, we had sustained winds of 15 to 20 mph with gusts to 40 and the tent held up beautifully. We had light rain and the inside stayed nice and dry.The big windows made for an awesome breeze.The only negative thing I have to say is that the zipper on the carrying bag broke after one use. For such a sturdy tent, you'd think they would craft the zippers on the bags better. I'm going to contact Coleman about a replacement.*** Update *** I contacted Coleman shortly after writing this review. Customer service was friendly and very helpful. They shipped us a new carrying bag that was nicer than the one that came with the tent. Unfortunately, they don't sell them or we'd buy a couple of others for the rest of our Coleman stuff. I just wanted to provide this update to reflect the 100% positive experience we had with Coleman customer service.I plan to recommend this tent to all our friends.Everyone in our group was awed by how cool our tent was. If you want to be the envy of your fellow campers, or if you just like to have an easy set-up experience, you definitely want this tent!

  Used this tent twice.  First time I camped in it, it was beautiful weather, and other than some difficulty getting the tent back in its carrying case, I was more than happy.  Second time I camped in it, it rained both outside and inside the tent.  Basically every seam leaked water - not just the usual ""wicking"" problem of water seeping through porous tent material, this was big fat drops coming through visible pinholes in the seams.  I don't know if someone on the assembly line had too much coffee that day and I just got unlucky, or if it's a problem for all tents of this model and they're just hoping your warranty runs out before you us it in the rain, but after writing to the company and receiving exactly zero reply, my lifetime of using and swearing by Coleman products is at an end.

  Tent leaked (a lot) on the 1st use.  I even had the extra Coleman rain-fly installed, which it shouldn't have even needed as the tent is supposed to be waterproof without it.  It was a medium rain and it leaked all night through the sides.  When I reached out to Coleman customer support for assistance, they never got back to me other than to send me a survey to see how i liked my customer service (?).  This company has gone downhill in the past few years.  They used to make quality products and have excellent customer service.

  I purchased the 4 person tent for my son and I to use for Boy Scout campouts. It is the perfect size for two cots along the walls and a small walk space between them. The only way you will sleep four in this tent is to sleep side by side on the floor. I'm done with sleeping on the ground, so we went with the four person tent. The zippered sides fold down on three sides allowing good air flow through the tent on warm nights. We live and camp in Texas, so I don't know about cold weather camping in this tent. I will say to check the measurements of your cot as mine is 7 feet long and just fits inside the tent, touching both ends. The quality of materials and construction is what you would expect from Coleman, it seems to be pretty well put together and sturdy. You can put this tent up and take it down by yourself in the dark in a minute. It does not include the rainfly, so I bought one. You really don't need it though unless you are camping in a hurricane. The tent itself is pretty waterproof.

",4.0,Bryan D.,"Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2013","









  
  
    
  I like the tent, it works well.  You don't need a rain fly, it will keep the water out if you zip it all up, but if you're going somewhere rainy, get the rain fly.  If it does rain, and you don't have it, you have to have all of the windows closed and that can be very stuffy in the rain.It opens up in less than a minute.  It's very easy to pop it out.  It's very roomy inside.  The walls are fairly vertical so you get to use a lot of vertical space inside.  It says this is 6-person.  Everyone knows these numbers are optimistic, but it's really very comfortable for two on a queen size air bed.  I'd do three in a pinch, but this is a couple's tent. I'm 5'5"" and can stand tall inside, as tall as that is.  Airflow is good with the windows open and it keeps the bugs out pretty well.  The hook in the ceiling for the light is a nice touch.There aren't a lot of trade-offs to the instant tent design.  I set it up after dark and it wasn't a problem at all.  I find it really difficult to get the thing to retract enough to fit inside the included pouch.  I don't know if it will ever fit in there again.  I just wrap some bungees around it and transport it without the cover and it works fine.  I'm not patient enough to sit there and manipulate it to get it into the bag.

  Took this tent out a couple of weeks ago and was excited for a weekend of camping and canoeing. I've owned another Coleman insta-tent and loved its roominess and ease of set up. When setting up this new tent, we discovered that 2 of the upper extension arms were installed upside down as compared to the others that pulled out easily and locked into the thumb tabs. The 2 that were installed incorrectly were extremely difficult to pull out, never extending to their full length, leaving the tent lopsided.  Tried removing screws to correct, but couldn't slide the bars out. When taking the tent down, we could not push the faulty arms back in fully, so it wouldn't fit into the carry case. Kind of ruined our weekend, but at least the rain-fly kept us dry.

My gut tells me ventilation might not be so great, but just a hunch and cannot say with 100% certainty.I don't think I would rely on this to be my ""hardcore"" tent to rely on in all conditions, but for what our intended purposes are, overall I am very pleased that we got this tent.

  My wife and I set this up for the first time in less than one minute and all we did was read the 3-step instruction tab on the top of the frame!  It has everything we were looking for from room (more economy of space than a true dome tent) and ventilation (even has a roof vent covered by pop up rain fly) to quality of construction. Poles are seriously strong and have lots of tie down points being on the exterior, so high wind is not an issue.  I added two Coleman cots and a battery lantern (which hangs from an O ring at top of tent), so I'm as comfortable as I could be in a cabin.  The weight makes this tent a great one for a short haul to the campsite (the purpose for which I bought it), but you aren't going to want to hike it in too far.

  How do I rate an instant up tent? Well, this one I rated by how fast it went up and how long it took me to actually get it back in the bag and CLOSE it (when have you EVER been able to do that with a tent?!?). As advertised, 60 seconds up and, amazingly, I got it completely back into the bag and closed the bag in less than five minutes! Wow ... should have gotten one of these before! Haven't had it in the rain yet but the seaming looks good enough that it shouldn't leak much on you even without the rain-fly, which I also recommend, just in case you camp in the rain!

  I LOVE THIS TENT. After my friend let me borrow her smaller version of it, I decided I needed to get my own. I went for the bigger version and I'm glad I did, and now she wants to upgrade after seeing mine. They're both awesome but I love this one because I can stand up in it with a lot of head room to spare (I'm 5'6""). This really makes a difference when getting dressed, making the bed, really doing whatever. It fits my queen blowup mattress and then there's still half the tent of floor space and space left in front of the mattress too. VERY luxurious and roomy for 2 people. It would be decent for 4 people. I wouldn't attempt 6.. yeah it would be physically possible but let's face it if you are buying this tent then you are probably into comfort and convenience and that would be cramped.It is as easy and instant as it claims. It practically launches itself up, not kidding. I have put it up and taken it down on 3 camping trips now with my boyfriend watching me and drinking a beer, not lifting a finger. Don't worry, I put him to work on other stuff.. and I'm proud I can do this by myself and I love showing off how easy it is. People are impressed and a few friends now want to buy their own. No more stupid poles!!!!Can you put it up in a minute? YES. Can you take it down in a minute? YES. Can you get the thing back in the damn bag in a minute? NO. That part kind of sucks.. there are 3 instructions on the bag/tent about how to put the thing up but none about taking it down. But I have learned how to fold it back up again, much like you'd fold up a tripod and its legs, and then roll the tent part tightly around it. Then stuff the legs in the bag first, zip up partially and stuff the tent material into the bag and inch up the zipper while you keep doing that. Takes me about 5 minutes on my own now that I have a good method, but it would be faster & easier with another set of hands to get it in the bag. It was really frustrating the first time.As you might expect it's big in the bag, not something I'd ever consider backpacking with or lugging more than 5 or 10 minutes. But for my purposes and festival camping, it's awesome. No extra parts, no rainfly to keep track of - it has a clever system for that built in. The tent stakes are your typical flimsy kind, so if you need to stake down your tent for real then invest in something better.All that said, it's still a solid 5 stars for me. It does what it claims, it's nice quality, and I love how easy it is to do by myself.

  I haven't been camping since I was a boy.  I bought this tent for my family's first camping trip.  My sweetheart and I kicked our daughters out and into their own little tent, so the size was more than enough for the two of us.  I do think that 4 people could sleep in the tent, as long as they are good buddies and not restless sleepers.  Super easy to set up and tear down.  Of course I couldn't fold it up exactly like it was new, but it still fit in the bag.  As other reviews have noted, the included stakes are cheap.  Buy some good stakes.  It was fairly windy the day we went camping, and we were on a soft, sandy area.  The shorter included stakes would not have held the tent down.  I did put large rocks on the stakes I purchased, ended up having no problems.

  I love this tent, it gets five stars because it is exactly how described on the site! We looked up the you tube videos for it and thought ok maybe they are exaggerating, but no it really is that easy to put up and take down! We bring this tent with us to Sturgis Rally and it was the talk of the camp ground! Goes up easy peasy, and has so much space inside. We had a raised full size air mattress in here along with a medium cooler, small trash can, small fan, and small bag of snacks and there was plenty of room to walk along side of the bed to door and to change in the tent.It rained and got pretty windy a couple days this last year in Sturgis and our tent had no issues at all! I was very impressed! At night it was nice to open the side windows and the wind would flow through and cool off the tent nicely. No bugs got through at all, and take down was very easy! No messing with poles, no risk in ever loosing any poles! I would highly recommend this tent to anyone who loves camping and loves it when your tent setup goes smoothly!! Love it!!

  Been camping with this tent 3 long weekends.  Works very well.  I have the optional rain fly and the tent stayed dry during a torrential downpour and stayed stable during 60 mph gusting wind.I'm 6'-0"" and, while I can't stand up fully, it's easy to get dressed while upright.  Very spacious inside.As always, the number of people claimed is accurate so long as everyone is willing to be cozy.  For 2 adults and 2 kids, I'm sure it will work fine, so long as no one is known for rolling around in their sleep.  A queen sized air mattress fits fine with a little floor space to spare.  Camping solo with a folding metal cot is a pleasure.Very cleverly designed.  The 1 minute setup claim is pretty accurate (not including the 1st attempt).  The only caveat, and this is far from a ""real"" problem, is that it's easy to put your fingers in the wrong place (near the peak) while folding/collapsing the tent.  After being careless once, you'll remember.Seems pretty well made.  I'd recommend it to family and friends.

  Took this camping this weekend, and was duly impressed.We arrived late at the camp site.  As usual.  It was dark.  I had never opened the tent, but after viewing the videos on YouTube, it looked easy.  And was it ever easy.  It took longer to find the stakes in the dark than to assemble the tent.  30 seconds was about right for setting it up.  Inside, quite large - large enough for two full-size cots and all our stuff.  It would likely have held many more arranged Tetris(TM)-like on the floor, but it was comfy for two.  It was low 50's and there was some condensation on the inside in the morning, but nothing unusual - there are vents on the ceiling that allow for airflow.I haven't been through a rainstorm in the tent, but the seams look tight.I LOVE this tent.

  We shopped around for a while before replacing our Cabella's Alaskan Guide model, 10-person tent. We loved it, but the zippers were failing and we wanted a smaller tent that would save space and weight in our Jeep. We also liked the idea of an easy setup.The Coleman 6-person tent had just the right dimensions for the two of us. It fit our queen size air bed with plenty of room left to store our gear out of the weather.The price was great.It took about a minute for me to put it up the first time. That is really good. No more fumbling around in the dark assembling all the pieces!Two minor complaints:- the bottom of the tent may not be the most durable material. We managed to poke a small hole in it. I think it hit a sharp stick during setup or taking it down, as we have only used it on a tarp.- as with about all new tents, the stakes are not worth the trouble. Get two packs of

  O.K., I received my 6-MAN Coleman Insta tent today.  I set it up and I really like it.  I can stand straight up inside (I'm 6'1"") and the walls are pretty straight-up compared to most tents, si the soace unsude us efficient.  It sets up real easy and comes down real easy, but it is a real pain to roll up and put in the bag.  I notice the bag is expandable, which is a very smart idea - plus, the bag in it's original size is adequate, unlike most other bags I've had where you really have to fight to get the tent back in after the original escape.The tent is a perfect size for just me or even me and one other for a quick night.I didn't leave the tent up for the rain today, but I notice that the weak spots in terms of leakage for most tents are better designed on this tent.  The bottom right-side of the door, where the two zippers meet is usually a very bad spot.  This tent has an outside flap covering the zipper that is at least twice as big as on my other tents.  I also has an inside triangle cover in that corner that keeps the zippers outside the that flap, so water running down the zipper should be directed outside instead of inside.  A slightly different, but similarly effective design is used at the edges of all the windows where the zippers pull down to.  In other words, the water running down those zippers should be directed outside the tent walls.The window also cuts below the level that the zippers pull down to, so that the window flap (which a number of people complained about becausee it doesn't tie-up and thus is flapping all night in the wind) can be tucked in to avoid any flapping.At 10' X 9', a 10' X 8' tarp fits perfectly under the tent for extra protection and to keep the tent clean.  It's nice to have the bottom of the tent clean, so you don't have to clean it off before you pack it or when you get home by taking it back out and messing around that way.  I keep the plastic bag the 10' X 8' tarp came in so a dirty tarp can be placed in it (trapping the dirt) and pulled out separately when you get home to clean.  I already have that tarp in the tent bag - it fit easily.I'm real anxious to see if water siphons in through the tent walls when something is touching the wall.  Even if that happens, I can deal with it, since there is just enough space to do so.  However, it would be sooo nice not to have to worry about that.

There was a lot of humidity obviously but no puddles in the tent and no water on the 3 of us. I was very impressed. Plenty of room to stand up in too. Setting up the tent after a rainy weekend so all the condensation can dry isn't a chore either which makes me more likely to do that.My only complaint is that it's a really big bag.

  I had low hopes for this tent and bought it just so I wouldn’t have to sleep in a car or outside on my hunting trip. This thing held up to torrential train for a day and a half until we decided to just pack it up and leave. Kept me dry every moment I was in it. However, like any other tent.. dew on the inside walls in the morning was to be expected because of temperature differences. Would buy again for sure

  How awesome that you can set up a tent in such a short amount of time.  It literally took minutes to set up and take down.  Super great considering we had a baby to manage as well.  The tent stayed pretty warm and held up in the wind and cold temps when we went beach camping.  The first night we noticed condensation inside the tent. Not sure what happened, but it was fine the next night.  Has great ventilation.  Kind of silly the stakes had to be purchase separately but whatever.  It's a good tent.  Folds up unbelievably fast.

  The main reason I bought this tent as opposed to other similar ones was the manufacturer's claim that ""by blocking 90% of sunlight coming into the tent, this technology lets you get some z’s while the sun’s still up."" I'm not someone who camps all that often, but I can tell you that any light blocking difference from a regular tent was minimal, if any at all. The sun had me up at 5:30 am and it was certainly not dark inside the tent by any means at that time. This was on a cloudy and rainy weekend, by the way.Besides that, the tent was good. It was very easy to put up. A friend and I got it up within 5 minutes. It was a bit more difficult taking it down and compacting it to get it back in the carrying case. On a positive note, there were no rain leaks. I did not buy the rain fly add-on or modify the tent in any way with sealant or anything. The rain was moderately heavy but it did just fine.

  This tent is outrageously quick and easy to set up.  I set it up by myself in under a minute with a baby strapped to me in a bjorn.  It's strong fabric and rain resistant.  We had a steady drizzle the first night and stayed dry despite forgetting to put up the rain fly.  The complaints about being wet in the morning are probably just regular condensation that you get from any tent.  The reason for the three stars is that the tent cannot handle even a little wind.  It is the opposite of aerodynamic and even a slight breeze flaps the tent sides so hard it will wake you up and have you out at 2 in the  morning trying to stake it down even tighter than before.  In fact, ours broke on the second weekend of use at the plastic hinges after being up on a moderately windy day.  Not sure if they'll warranty or repair it, but I will check back in to comment on the customer service once I hear back!

  My wife and I were looking for a easy to set up 3 season tent for car camping. This was the perfect solution. It sets up and tears down in a matter of minutes. We use two additional straps to keep the legs and tent together to make placing into the bag easier. We also use a tarp for a foot print to reduce moisture when we pack it. The OME tent pegs are crap. Go to REI and buy some good ones of your choice for the tent base and support lines (you will need 8). We also did take the precaution of seam sealing all the of the seams to prevent leaks. With a little preparation this is an excellent tent for it's design seasons. This tent is not designed for harsh weather with gale force winds or hard winter down pours. We use a 4 season Northface tent for hard winter camping. If you are looking for a good easy to set up car tent for summer, spring and light winter camping. You should be very happy. Be sure to order the rainfly.  I was somewhat annoyed that it wasn't included. The lack of rainfly and crappy tent pegs keep it from being a 5 star.  Then again what do you expect for under $200?

  I have had this tent for 3 years and have used the tent maybe 10-15 times. We bought this tent as our ""big"" tent to fit our cots and allow for space to stand. The interior is spacious and my 6'5"" husband can stand very comfortably and the two cots fit with plenty of extra room. The tent opens and closes VERY easily and can be done by one person. When packed up in the bag the tent is pretty heavy and still pretty big, but this is expected of this kind of tent (this isn't a tent you would want take if you had to hike to a camp site).  The walls and floor are well constructed (the floor is a thicker grade heavier material). We have used this tent in the rain without much leakage; however, we were using cots, so I can't say how it might feel if you had to sleep on the floor of the tent. My only complaint is that the door flap, because it is large without interior support, is sometimes difficult to zip closed with one hand (you need two hands to hold it taut to line up the zippers).

  I have used the tent one time and slept in it for four nights. I was AMAZED at how easily, and quickly, the tent went up!  I like the window set up and I really like having a high enough ceiling to be able to stand up inside. The tent is pretty heavy when it is packed up, but weighs less than one of those pop-up shade structures. I car-camp so its weight was not an issue. I have only two minor ""issues"" with the tent. 1. When taking it down, I found it impossible to get the darn thing back into its case. I wrestled, tucked, and wrangled until I settled on using a shoestring to tie the case ""closed."" However, a few days later, when I was putting all of the camping gear away, I was able to tuck all of the fabric in and zip the case shut. Maybe there was air trapped in the tarp area? Maybe I was overly tired and a tad hungover when I had to break down camp? That part will forever remain a mystery.  2. The door zipper. I didn't reduce the star rating for this issue because I was camping in a bone-dry, concrete-like campsite, at a music festival (don't be jealous!) so I was unable to use any tie-downs. Therefore, there wasn't any tension on the walls of the tent. I believe (and hope) that, were I able to get some tension on the walls that the door zipper would not have caught at the corner each time I went in, or out, of the tent.Once I use the tent again, I will update my rating based on my.. errrr... the tent's... issues.

  Receive the tent and immediately set it up without reading instruction.  I had seen the YouTube videos of the tent and was going from memory.  I was able to set up tent in less than two minutes and completely set up including staking the corners an guidelines in less than five minutes.  Take down was just as fast.  We still haven't use it camping but I always seal the seams and waterproof the roof and sides each season.  I have never had any 'water leak/seepage' problems ever since I started sealing tents at the beginning of each season.  Putting the tent back into carrying bag took some doing.  I just kept rolling it until all the air was expelled and the tent was small enough to go into the bag.  I am only giving this 4 stars because it did not come with a rain fly.  Less expensive tents come with a rain fly and this would have been a nice added feature on this tent.  With a rain fly, they could have added a mesh roof to increase the ventilation and lessen the condensation issues that some tents have.  Condensation seems to be a universal issue no matter what you do on how to prevent it.  Despite all this, I would definitely reccomend this tent.

  I bought this last summer. It's roomy for two kids and I with gear with space to spare . Setup was quick and easy and believe me, you need to be quick so you can keep an eye on your kids. You can stand in this as you know so changing clothes is no problem.I took it camping twice and it drizzled just a little late one night. That morning, I touched the inner walls of the tent and it was wet. Don't know if the cold air caused it to collect and sweat on the inside like a cold glass of water but it surely was wet. It dried up as the sun came up so no harm no foul. I always bring some large trash bags with me anyway for trash and I guess now in case it leaks so I can throw my backpacks and stuff quickly in a trash bag to keep my clothes and stuff dry. I sleep on an air mattress so it should still be ok if the tent gets too soaked.As far as the rainfly for this, I'll just buy a tarp that's bigger than the one Coleman is selling for this tent. Stakes are wimpy for the tent and rainfly. I bought better ones and they didn't cost much so it's no biggie.

  Popped up in a minute.  Thrilled at the ease to set up!  But wondered why inside walls were sticky to the touch.  Think something went wrong in the weather tec process for our tent.  With just a light rain for a couple hours the second evening, there was water running in streams down the inside walls.  Thank goodness we bought the separately sold rain fly, so at least we didn't have water coming in the roof.  Hoping we just got a lemon.  Will order a new one to try again next summer.  Also please note 6 person size is very small - barely had a walking path around queen air mattress.  We kept about a 3 ft wide area going from door to back wall open for keeping our bags & changing, which meant we kept air mattress to the left with no walking path around it.  So we will try a bigger size when we order again.  Loved the open feeling with windows fully zipped open and the little air vent built into roof was very helpful in keeping the air temp comfortable when windows were closed. This would have been a four star if ours was water proofed correctly, and a five star if it was also roomier with a D style door.  Had to use two hands to unzip door and always have to start at bottom and use two separate zippers.  We've owned bigger 6-man tents before.  Suggest you go by the actual dimensions.  Outline it somewhere and laoyout your stuff in the outline to see if it is truly enough space for your liking.  And to make sure it's truly waterproof, perhaps raining on it with a hose in your yard before you head off on vacation would be a good idea.  Fortunately we had a dry week and it only rained one more time toward the end of our trip.  We put up a huge tarp over the tent to stay mostly dry during the second rainstorm.  We still got some water along the bottom of some of the walls.  Hope there aren't too many lemons in their manufacturing process.  Sounds like others have been pleased with the weather protection of their Coleman 6-person Instant Cabin Tent.  We will try again as we loved the ease of setup and openness with Windows fully unzipped.

I could see little holes in between the seams. Also the door zipper was a little awkward to close. Zipping around the d-curve was tricky. Required 2 hands. Since there is 2 zippers to close the door there is a small gap where the zippers meet at the bottom of the door.Another issue is size. Height is awesome. My husband who is 5'11 can stand in there. But length is the same as my other 4 person tent. So, if you are looking for a true to size 6 person tent I would suggest trying the Coleman 8-person instant tent.Putting the tent away isn't as instant.

  Product is as easy as it says to set up and take down.  My disappointment is the size, 4 man tent; not hardly.  Barely fits a queen size mattress.  Wish we would have purchased the 6 man tent for the small price difference even though there is only the two of us.  There is no room to walk around as I said it is wall to wall mattress.  Thank goodness we never had bad weather as it would have been miserable.  Also disappointed that I missed it didn't come with a rain cover it is a separate purchase.  Had a little problem with condensation when it got so cold outside and the heat inside had to leave windows open in the evening to stop it from really building up.

  This product is well made and is almost everything Coleman says it is. We went on an eight night car camping trip and changed locations every night. The ease of set up and take down was wonderful.The negative was we had a fairly heavy and unexpected rain storm one night, the tent held up to the wind and rain well in the beginning. The problem is where the roof vent is located,there is a design flaw here. The water sheds from the covered vents well but a pool of water forms in two spots on either side of the vents. This standing water, which is easily a 1/2 inch deep, will seep through the fabric and stitching over the course of a rain shower and you get a steady drip. You can physically push the water out if you know it is happening. If you happen to be sleeping or away during the rain shower you will find wet gear if it is in the middle of the tent. Another weak spot with this tent is without a rain fly the water has to run down and over the door. It does not leak but if you have to enter or exit the tent during or after a shower the door will fall to the inside and pour water into the tent from the little pool on top as you pull the zipper. I solved these problems by creating my own rain fly and vestibule with a nylon tarp (appx. 7x9), two adjustable metal poles and some parachute cord. It would be nice if Coleman offered an optional rain fly made for the tent so it could be used during inclement weather. I would recommend this tent to a friend but would give them the same information and warning I offered here.

  Amazingly easy and roomy tent. 2 minute set up. 5 with the rain fly. If your expecting rain, get the fly.  We weathered the remnants of hurricane Florence in New England. 3 days of constant rain. Minimal pooling of water in 2 corners. That's it. We used a huge queen sized air mattress with room for our stuff. I only wish it had a flap for an extension cord. It's nice to be able to stand inside.

    Heavier duty material and overly satisfied workmanship of the zippers
  
",5.0,Early Riser 365,"Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2014","









  
  
    
  First, it is a Coleman. Heavier duty material and overly satisfied workmanship of the zippers. Does not come with the rainfly, comes as pictured. You really don't need the rainfly but would be nice to have for additional protection from those rain storms that blow up on your excursion. You can buy it separately which is something I think should be included, period. But the tent is nice and roomy with standing room also. I have a party of three, so I bought this six party tent. You need to be able to put some gear in the tent besides yourself ya know.  And yeah, you can pop it in under a minute. But, that does not include staking it down. Good rule of thumb I find is to buy double the size of your party so as to be able to put those duffel bags and extra clothes etc. inside and be able to move around some. Especially if you use cots. Not a hiking tent unless you are a giant or have a pack mule, not including or insinuating the wife. Tip, leave the cardboard box inside the bag to put the tent back into for storage and protection. No need to thank me later, you are welcome. Have fun!

  So far I would say this tent is everthing the reviews said. Easy  setup, did it by myself, I'm a senior. I chose the 6 man because the reviews said it would hold a queen size mattress & plenty of room for luggage. I also have 2 small dogs. My husband had an astma attack the weekend we went camping and so I managed the whole set up & take down myself. The dogs even loved it. It rained at night. Not a drop in the tent. I did waterproof before we went , just to be on the safe side. We have beautiful weather in Hawaii but the rain & wind can be intense, depending on what side of the island you are on. Haven't camped in years & are so glad we decided to do this occasionally. I would definetly recommend this tent. 10 minute set up & take down.

  When I first heard about Coleman Instant Tents, I was intrigued. And then when I saw this 4-Person model on sale for $69, I bought one. I took it camping a couple of weeks ago, and I love it. This was far and away the easiest tent I have ever set up. It is only slightly heavier than a comparable conventional pole tent, but the 1-minute setup time and 3-minute takedown time MORE than make up for the slight increase in weight.There is just enough room inside this 4-Person model to fit one queen-size Coleman airbed, and this one is just barely too short for me to stand up straight in (I'm 5'10""). I highly recommend this tent to anyone who likes camping, but doesn't like tents that take 20 minutes to set up.

  I love this tent it is the fastest and easiest tent I have ever set up. I needed a replacement for the old Wenzel that I have had for over 20 years. The Wenzel was always a pain with the poles constantly falling apart while trying to erect it and would leak some during a heavy rain. I bought the rain fly for this one so, hopefully that won't be an issue. My daughters were playing in it this morning and I noticed how well the roof vents work on releasing the built up heat in the tent. I had this tent up in less than a minute by myself and this was right after the unboxing without reading any directions. I have always been a loyal Coleman customer when it came to my camping gear but, this is my first Coleman tent. Coleman has great customer service too! I have called them in the past on an issue I had on a propane stove and they sent me the part out fast at no charge! The material is heavy duty too being thicker than most tents on the market. Great job Coleman this is by far the best and easiest family tent to set up! No cussing required!

  This tent was extremely easy to put together, we did a test run in the backyard before a camping trip. Unfortunately, it is just too small to sleep 4 comfortably. We are a family of 4, 2 adults, and 2 kids and typically use one air mattress and two foam mattresses and that would simply be impossible so we had to return and go a different route. If you are looking for a lightweight, easy to assemble tent this is a great option. If you need a bit of space for a family of 4 or 4 adults this is not the tent for you! It would be perfect for a couple (and possibly a dog). :)

  Before I found this tent, after a five year lapse in the camping trips that I love due to arthritis, bad back and deteriorating knees, I decided that life without camping trips is no longer an option.....my mind and spirit were getting as feeble as my joints. So I took my old small pop up tent and hit the state park. Not a good thing. After all the bending and wrestling spring rods through the pockets to set up and then crawling into my old tiny,4' high center tent and even worse trying to get back out. I only made it a couple nights before I gave up and went home.Then I searched Amazon for a different tent. Lo and behold the Colman instant tent! I got it and took it to the yard and was absolutely amazed at how it practically set itself up! It took me 3 1/2 minutes but like I said, I'm creaky in the knees! I know if I could walk at a normal pace it would have been just a minute or less.Inside it is huge and will easily accommodate a large queen size air mattress and my gear and a sturdy chair for getting up and down and leaning my cane for easy grabbing in the night! And, it still leaves plenty of room to move around and stand up straight (glorious!!!!)I read some reviews that say it may leak but after zipping it all up (including the roof vents which I believe those reviewers may have missed) I sprayed it from all angles with the hose and really soaked it.....not a drop inside.I do think that those leak reviews may also have had to do with the vents. If you seal it up too tight there may be condensation that might seem like leakage but is really just from the camper breathing.This tent is going to change my life in a very good way!

  I was a bit nervous setting this up the first time.  I got to the campground well after dark, had to find a space, didn't want to use lanterns due to insects, etc.  With no experience with these tents I got it up in about 2 minutes.  I'm about 6' tall and could stand up straight in a decent portion of the tent, with minor bending in the rest.  I put a queen size inflatable mattress in it, some chairs for sitting, and had plenty of room for gear.  Taking the tent down was also easy, though two of us combined to stuff it back into the cardboard it came in before putting it back in the carry sack.  The carry sack (as I noticed later) has a portion you can rip apart to make putting the tent back in easier, without struggling to fit it back into its original dimensions.  I would be concerned about water condensation on the inside if you don't leave the windows cracked, though if you do that you're giving up on some of the rain-proofing.  Because of that I decided to get the rainfly for this tent.  In all, I think this is a great tent as long as you're car camping.  I would never try to pack this in on a trail.

  This thing is pretty darn good.It's true; you basically take it out of the box, bend the big joints in the tent poles the other way; and it pops up.It's really not too bad putting it back into the tent bag, either, unlike most tents.Be careful not to get your fingers stuck between the folded poles when the tent is closed, or closing. You could crush your finger pretty good. I almost did.But other than that, I'm pretty satisfied with this tent. It even held up well in, oh, I'd say 35-40 mph winds. I had one side of it guy-lined to my Honda Element and the other side guy lined with rebar stakes; and no problems.Even if the wind does collapse it, since the tent poles have joints in the middle (think of a knee, only it bends both ways), high winds don't really hurt the tent, they just make it much smaller.I don't quite know why I'm not giving it 5 stars. I'm not totally in love with it, but it's pretty good and I respect it.

One word of caution tho, do not trip on the doorway flap and grab the tent to stop your fall, or you, too, will tear the fabric that holds the tent to the pole.  Not bad design on Coleman's part, just clumsiness on mine.  Fits a queen-size w/ room on the sides for all your gear.  When you're ready to pack up the campsite, open all the windows in the tent, then let it down, it takes some time to flatten out, doesn't pack up as compactly as they show, so you'll probably have to open up that extra gusset in the carrying bag.

It's supposed to be big enough for 6 people... I think of it more as a two-person tent.

  I had to return mine's because i had a deal where i got the 6-person version. I did setup both, and it only takes about 2 minutes to setup, probably about 10 minutes to unpack (time it takes to take out air and to cram into it's compressed carrying bag). The zippers seem durable and this feels much better than the bargin no-named branded tents. This really is quality you can feel. It also feels really spacious. Even the 4-person tent, i could get up and walk around (i'm 6'0 tall).On the downside, the tent itself is much bigger than the cheaper tents. If you're taking a flight to go camping, this in itself is its own luggage.

  My wife and I had an older instant set up style tent we confiscated from her daughter and we liked it.  We wanted a bigger one but nobody seemed to make them anymore.  Now everyone seems to sell the Coleman ones and at pretty good prices too.  We bought this for our daughter to replace the one we confiscated for our use years ago.  She really likes it and had no problem setting it up on a recent trip.  My wife and I have a bigger version of this tent and like it too.  Keep in mind that a 6 person tent only sleeps 6 if you really like each other.  I think this 6 person tent allows 15 square feet of floor space per person.  Our larger one allows 14 square feet per person....that's 2' X 7'.  So by looking at the floor space it's easy to see that the number of people they are rated for is somewhat inflated.  If you camp in areas that have a lot of rain the way to go is to place your tent under a tarp, that way you know you'll stay dry and it keeps all the tree sap and stuff off your tent too.

The windows are a nice height for privacy, but less than ideal if you want to get much of a breeze inside the tent while you're sleeping, though even that part isn't bad.Overall, I'm very happy with this tent for weight, ease of transport, and ease of set-up and tear-down.Update: I've had this tent for more than two years now, and despite regular use, it's still holding strong. I've got one foolish puncture in the floor I need to mend, but that was my fault for dropping a knife on the floor inside the tent.I've gotten nervous about the lack of rainfly, but I still haven't had any leaks in the tent, despite use in heavy rain. I would absolutely buy this tent all over again, and highly recommend it for convenience and ease of use.

  This tent really did go up in less than a minute.  You do need to allow a few extra minutes to stake it out.  We were concerned about the reviews that stated it leaked, but we used it in the rain twice on a long road trip with no problems.  The first time we put it up, we noticed that the very top tie (which creates the point at the top of the tent, near the vents) was loose.  If we had not tightened that, the rain would have puddled on the roof and poured in through the ventilation screens.  I'm wondering if that could have caused some of the leak problems other campers reported.We were comfortable with 4 adult sized people (2 adults, 2 teens) but we don't put anything in our tent other than sleeping bags.  If we had added chairs, air mattresses, or the two other people it can supposedly house, it would have been a very snug space.  We felt the tent was roomy due to the head room - we could easily stand and change in the tent, which was a nice feature.

  So I was a Cub/Boy Scout from 1st grade through age 18 and must have gone camping at least 8-10 times a year as a kid.  Now that I am older and have a son who is a Cub Scout, I needed to upgrade my equipment. On our first campout we borrowed a VERY nice North Face dome tent.  It kept us dry and warm and I thought I wanted to buy the same tent for myself until I came accross this tent.  There is no way to express how quickly and easily it goes up and comes down.  It can easily be done by one person while your little campers ""help"".  I watched as other fathers struggled to get up standard tents and ours was up in well under 2 minutes.  I did spring for better stakes to hold it down (the coleman upgrade stakes fit PERFECTLY into the slots).  I have the rain fly although we didn't need it given the weather.  I did a ton of research before I bought this tent, and honestly almost didn't purchase it because it was so inexpensive ($145 for tent fly and stakes).  The review that sold me was a video review that stated they would use this tent more often than their expensive tents because of ease of use. They were absolutely correct.  Buy this with confidence if you are doing any family or scout camping.  With all this said, it is obviously not a backpacking tent but it does come in a nice duffle bag so can easily be carried by an adult from you car to the campsite.

Fast forward to setting up our tent at our campsite...it only took about a minute or two to set it up! I was impressed! It's a great size, but I can't imagine 6 people fitting in this tent. I would say 5 but 6 would be cramped.  I also like that the tent has pockets inside so you can put keys, phones, etc. BUT, there was one issue...so you can hang a lantern/fan from the inside top of the tent. A light fan was hanging from it when it decided to rain on our trip...went inside the tent after the rain stopped to change clothes and noticed there was a small puddle of water in the tent. I guess there is a vent at the top and it gets exposed when you hang a lantern or fan because it pulls the fabric down which is normally not a big deal but it is when it rains.

  I just got this tent today. It's very easy to setup in less than 60 seconds. We are having a rain storm today, here in Florida. I thought this would be the perfect time to test the problems people said they were having with this tent. They are true. The tent leaks along the seams were the inside pockets meet the tent walls. The pan seams leak if you don't have something to keep against the side wall, so the pan stays tight. I used two towels on both sides to do that. The leaks on the pockets could have been avoided if they would have just run the seam tape they used around the edge of the pockets. Or folded over the pockets before they stitched it to the side walls. The pan leak could have been avoided if they used  steak tie downs in those places, to strech the fabric just like they did in the front and back of the tent. The top vent leaked very little, just tie the center tie snug to the top support post. That stop that leak. Keep in mind I put this tent up in a heavy rain storm with wind. My review seams pretty critical of this tent, but I still gave it four star. The tents fabric is nice and thick and didn't leak. Just keep a towel handy to dry those spots. None of the leaks I spoke of are bad. I would feel comfortable taking this tent anywhere as long it's not in a blizzer or hurricane. I am a avid hunter and it's coming with me this season. I have own many tents before, all came with rain flys, they all leaked in heavy rain worst than this one. The ease of this tent to put up is great when you what to get to your activity quick. The height on the inside makes it easy to move around. The space inside is roomy for two full size air beds. With the mild winters we have here in Florida, I don't think we will cold at all.

But I also wanted a decent tent so I would have a nice camping experience, and hopefully want to go again in the future. This tent takes under 5 minutes to set up and under 10 minutes to pack up. The only reason it takes longer to break down is if you are really careful about getting it folded up neatly. I was worried when there was no rain cover included, especially when it started raining during our trip. It was just a moderate rain, not a downpour, but the tent did not leak at all. That said, I will probably spray it will some fabric sealant before the next trip just to be on the safe said. The tent is roomy and comfortable. Would definitely buy it again and recommend it. It is a great, simple tent.

    The Fitted Sheet dilemma

  Ridiculously easy to set up.  I ordered the tent because on family vacations I find myself swearing when putting up the tent (I swear easily, but not the way I want to start a vacation).  It was a swear-free set up, and most of it was done by my 11 year old.  Taking it down was a bit more...challenging.I felt like I was faced with the fitted sheet of a super king-size bed.  No matter how I attempted to take it down, it turned into a wad-fest.  I did get it into the bag it came with, but I have no idea how.The only other issue we had was lots of condensation on the inside of the tent.  Hard not to touch the door wall, which was a bit clammy...okay, soaking wet.Have no idea how it will be in rain- we shall find out soon.

  I loved how easy this tent was to set up. The instant poles are so convenient and easy. I also think the roominess is good. However, we experienced a rain storm, and water leaked right into the tent from the top and the sides. The inside was very wet with puddles all over the bottom. I was very bummed about the water issue because it was a good tent otherwise. I ended up sending it back because it tends to rain every year at my favorite camping spot.

  As a treat for surviving out first year of law school, our 3 person team set out for a trip in the Michigan wilderness. The ten slept three perfectly and allowed us room to store our gear at the foot of our sleeping bags. The net-covered vents were perfect for adjusting the temperature inside our tent and airing it out. Best part about the pop-up style is that assembly takes all of 5 minutes. It is perfect for those of us who have a lack of camping skills/do not like to read directions.The only downside was being forced to insulate ourselves by keeping the vents closed every night and waking up to a muggy and wet tent (condensation). Not sure if this can be avoided in tents made of more breathable materials.**The first time I ordered this, my package was stolen and I panicked because our trip was days away. However, Amazon saved the day by express shipping new gear and saving the trip from disaster. Also, they responded to my 8P.M. email right away. It was fantastic customer service.

  There’s a video from Coleman showing this tent sustaining a 60 mph wind tunnel and an extreme storm test where the competitor’s test was wet, but the inside of the Coleman tent was “bone dry.”  When the tent arrives, it advises the user that the tent will only survive a 35 mph wind, and the tent should not be used in heavy rains, and further website checks reveal that a rainfly is sold separately.  Reviews on the rainfly describe it as not being effective.  I’m sending the tent back, certainly in the hopes of receiving a full refund.  A tent that doesn’t keep you dry in a rainstorm is useless.

  We love this tent!  We took it camping a few times this summer and used it in Yellowstone.  It poured rain and we had heavy winds in  Yellowstone and you DO NOT need to purchase the rainfly for this tent as some reviewers have stated.  The way it's designed, it has a built-in rainfly.  We never got a drop of water in our tent.  We did have morning condensation of course, but I've never found a tent that solves that problem.  This tent is so incredibly easy to put up and take down and even fits without any problem into the bag.  It's just my daughter and I and other campers were seriously jealous we got ours up in a  matter of a minute or 2.  We inflated 2 full size air mattresses and had room on each side and down the middle, and at the opening to spare for our bags, a side table and shoe bins.  The top of the tent has a hanging hook, which is perfect to hang a lantern for an overhead light.  Highly recommend this tent.

  Set it up by myself today, was pretty simple. There are plenty of screens, looks to be well built. there are no tie backs on the screens but its ok its just as easy to roll and tuck against the screen bottom. Before buying this size, I staked out a 9x10 area in the yard, put all of my items in that square, everything fit pretty well, so i bought the 9x10. Problem is that its not actually 9x10. That is the size of the ""tub"" that is sown in the bottom. U lose 6+ inches all the way around cause it rolls up the sides, roughly 18 sq ft lost. And the wall angle causes even more lost space. Im suprised that no one has said anything about the size in the reviews. im assuming that the instant 8 is 7x13, since it says its 8x14, we'll see, returning this one and getting the 8.

  I took this tent car-camping for 3 days 2 nights with my boys (ages 10 and 14) near our home. It took them no time to set it up and I have set it up by myself in a couple of minutes. I am under 5'4 and did not have a problem extending the poles fully. It is a little heavy, but they did not have to carry it far and we had plenty of room between us with a twin matress for me and a queen for them. It was well ventilated and though the windows do not go all the way down, this was no problem for me as I like my privacy when asleep (glare from [ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire, Full Color 7"" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi]]. We had a tent fan with the convenient clip at the ceiling which worked well for us.  I think the two pockets seem chintzy with the tents size and I did keep looking for more near the roof (don't use the two vent pockets as your contents will slide down inside the tent). I was able to get the tent closed all the way even with two zippers and rounded corners.It did not rain so we had no chance to test leakage. This is about the fourth tent I have used in my four years camping experience (going only 3-4 times a year), but I think it is a winner. I agree with other reviewers that it is difficult to put back in the bag and I started off with my own stakes from the outset.

  Love this tent. Seriously sets up in 1-2 minutes.  Taking it down takes a few extra minutes since you need to get it back into the bag.  The only negatives about this tent is the size when stowed.  If you low on cargo space these instant tents could be an issue for you.  My 4 person Coleman instant tent takes up almost 2x the space as my 6 person normal tent.

  This tent must not have been sprayed with the waterproof chemicals. I used it for the first time recently and it drizzled for 1 hour. The tent pooled water and leaked from the top for the next day. The sides of the tent were soaked from a drizzle. THIS TENT IS SUPPOSED TO BE WATERPROOF NOT WATER RESISTANT! It couldn’t even handle drizzle. Look at other reviews. Apparently Coleman makes mistakes and not every tent leaves their factory with the appropriate coating to make it waterproof. Amazon says this is not returnable and I’m extremely disappointed. DO NOT BUY THIS TENT.

  Two things that you need to know before purchasing this tent, you have to purchase a seperate rain fly that is not included and secondly, you need to purchase a trap or something to place the tent on because a hole can be ripped in the bottom with small rocks or debris that may be on the ground, I know because this happened to the first tent I brought. Just as adevertised, it is easy to assemble in minutes, while others are still trying to put the rods through theirs, but they don't give good instructions as to how you can easly fold it to place in back in the bag that it comes in. You can however find better instructions online. I also don't feel that this is truly a 6 person tent unless you want to be packed in like sardines in a can. I purposely brought it to have room for my wife and myself to have room to move around in the tent with our queen sized air mattress.

  Great tent! Camped in it for 6 weeks in all kinds of weather. Never leaked a drop. I did use seam sealer on the outside but Coleman seals the inside seams with a special tape. One storm had wind shear and I knew the tent was coming down but it held up fine. It rained very hard and not one drop. I do use 10"" tent stakes which is important for storms. Buy the ones that look like nails.My only complaint is I've been trying to buy the rain fly since July and it's still on back order. It's suppose to be available 10-9-14. So if you want one you better jump on it quick because they don't stay in stock but only a couple days. Amazon and Coleman are the only reasonable places to buy one.

  It is true this sets up in about a minute flat and can be setup by a single person.  The flooring material is heavy duty and extends about a foot up from the ground all around to keep water and muck out.  The tent material is heavy duty grade, the seams are sewn inside out and covered. Its got plenty of ventilation. This product does everything its supposed to.  But one note, it is advertised as a 6 man tent.  Technically you could stuff six men in there but it would be unbearably cramped.  Allowing for room to move about, and room for gear storage I say this is a 4 man tent.  It is most ideal and perfect as a family tent for two adults and two kids.

As some others have mentioned if you have ever purchased a tent before the man rating is not what it says. The Man rating is for the amount of 150lb men at 5'5"" stuffed into the tent like sardines. This tent will fit THREE grown men with a little bit of extra room. My spouse, 6 year old daughter and I fit with two cots and a little space at our feet for the dog.Tent is a quality product and yes I got it set up in less than 60 seconds the first time out of the bag, of course that doesnt including staking it down. Tear down was pretty simple as well and fit back in the back pretty easily. Still a little disappointed that it does not come with a rain fly.

  There are some good and bad qualities to this tent. I like this tent for  it's ease to put up and take down. The zipper windows  store nicely when open. It's also big and roomy. I don't like the sewing on this tent. There are many places where the edges of the fabric are exposed and not tucked into the sewn seam as they should be. It is very difficult to get into carrying bag after taking it down ( I suppose this will get better as I figure out how to fold it better). The directions to put away aren't very good. There was also a pinched and torn cover on one of the ""elbows"". It took a lot of work to get it moved into the right spot. Over all, it's a pretty good tent, just not the quality I'm used to from Coleman.

I'm not giving it 5 stars because I haven't seen how it stands up to high wind or rain yet.  I do wish that it came with a rain fly as I'd feel better if there was another layer to put on to help protect in that regard.  He is 6 ft 3 and it was tall enough that it was comfortable for him to change clothes inside it and he had a cot which fit with no problem too.  Of course like every tent I've ever bought this one is over-rated on capacity (most people don't sleep with their bags touching)-I'd say it would be comfortable for 3-maybe 4 but I'd lean towards 3 when you consider cot/sleeping space and some room to store clothes or other gear.

  I got this tent for a camping trip in October and it worked great.  It sets up so fast.  I was with a group of people and we set up camp every evening in a new place and broke down every morning.  Every day I got a lot of comments about how fast this thing sets up.  Not necessarily all that important, but definitely nice.  Its big.  plenty of room for my wife and me and to lay out a blanket for the dogs to sleep on and still room for our bags.  Also nice to be able to stand up and get dressed without having to hunch over.The down side is it is big and heavy.  My camping trip was in airplanes and space and weight are always issues in planes.  This thing weighs over 20 pounds and all folded up its close to 4 feet long.  I thought about taking my old dome tent until I spent a night in this tent.  That was all it took, quick set up/tear down and room to stand to change clothes made it worth making room for it in the plane.I got the rain fly just in case and used it just about every night, Every morning the outside was soaked with dew (except for the couple mornings that it was covered with frost or ice) but it was always dry inside.

We got the tent quickly, and when it came time to set it up at the campsite, we were able to do it easily. I watched a few of the videos on You Tube so I'd have some idea of how to do it, but the directions were easy to follow on the inside of the tent case.When we got ready to pack up and head out, in a bit of a rush, breaking down the tent and getting it back into the case was super simple - the case itself is a little bit large so that you can get it back in without having to fold it map-like to be exactly the same as it came out. Most of our trouble was trying to get the air out of the tent that had been trapped in it when we took it down.We had a tarp over it through some serious rain and wind, so I can't vouch for leaking issues, but we had a great trip and this tent was a big part of that.I was VERY pleased with this tent.

  The side with one large door has enough slack that is is not vertical (when dry), which allows it to pool water. I'll add seam sealer, but the sides of the tent should be shedding water, not holding it. I've triple checked all poles and readjusted stakes, still leaks 2+ tbl spoons after 5 minutes of light spray from hose.The darkness of the tent is nice.

  I don't often leave feedback, but had to share what a wonderful tent this is, especially given the price. We previously purchased a Coleman Dome 5, which we returned after we got wet during a rainstorm (it leaked from the top). This tent is just as easy to put up - takes less than a minute - but the fabric is MUCH thicker than the Dome 5, we know it won't leak from the top with the optional rainfly, and we love that we can stand up while inside. We were originally planning to purchase a very similar, much more expensive tent from REI - the Rapid 6, which retails for $270.00, but are pleased to report that the Coleman seems more durable (we tested the Rapid 6 in the store), the fabric is thicker, and it was $110 less. Anything REI sells is supposed to be exceptional quality whereas Coleman is supposed to be... well... affordable.... but I think this particular Coleman tent is a gem.

  I am glad I got this tent, though the expense was a bit high for camping 1-2 times a year. With arthritis issues creeping into my joints I'm very happy with the ability to put the tent up by myself.  I take the help, but I don't have to. The first time I used it turned out to be the one trip in 17 years that we had the worst weather. Heavy rain and wind gusts up to 70mph and temperatures in the 30's.  That all lasted hours before we decided to escape in the early morning. The thickness of the tent did provide some warmth with the windows closed (so glad I had packed the silk long johns). The not-so-sure news is there were leaks. The tent was well anchored but being blown around which created some wicking and some puddles from zippers, the rain managed to find the vunerable spots- nothing I couldn't mop up, but after several hours I was running out of towels and needed all my clothes to stay warm. I will probably seal the tent before the next use, though one weekend in 17 years is a good track record. Suggestion: be sure you know where the hub zipper is inside the tent and that it's well-velcroed if the weather turns nasty and pay attention to how you steak down the tent as too much pull can cause stress on the seams. Other than those issues, I do like this tent and would recommend it. My 6-person Instant Tent is the perfect Trump Tower for my husband-less camping trips with friends.

  Absolutely love this tent! I am a life-changing camper and this is my 3rd tent as an adult. Love that the poles are integrated into the tent and all you do is extend them. I was somewhat skeptical but the reviews were really good so I took a shot and it couldn't be worse than my tent at the time that leaked like a sieve. Disappointed that the rain fly is separate but it's a must and extremely easy to attach. As someone who takes good care of their camping equipment the one thing I struggle with is that for the final step of packing it essentially just gets stuffed into the tent bag and can't be folded up nicely.

  Really easy to set up and take down!But, the floor is basically paper thin and tears super easy. A basic Walmart folding chair ripped the floor in the first use, Coleman wouldn’t honor the warranty; said it’s my fault. Then on the second use small rocks on the dirt ground made several small holes. I’d put this tent as almost useless and wouldn’t recommend it unless you purchase a desperate tarp to lay down; If not for the easy of set up.

  I read multiple reviews on this product but figured it was a Coleman so it should hold up.  I have now used it twice and it no longer works.  One of the poles bent while putting away along with two zippers.  One on the main cabin door (which is a joke by the way, their are flaps that get in the way of the zipper while trying to go up and down) and the 2nd zipper that broke is on the carry case.I tried to send back to Amazon and they do not have another in stock so they are trying to give me a 4 person tent as a replacement and credit me back the balance.  I wouldn't recommend buying this.

  I had my doubts, but it was great. So easy to setup. It took 2 minutes to unbox and setup.  This was our first tent camping trip as mom, son amd 100lb German Shepherd.  We used a queen and single air mattress and had toom at the foot of the tent for our clothes.  We had 4 hours of rain and the tent stayed dried.  I did use seam sealer prior to our camping trip.  This tent is durable and delivered everything it said it would. The only con was when packing to go home we couldnt get it small enough to fix back in storage bag.

  Amazingly easy to set up.  Takes less than a minute to open and stand, and a couple more minutes to stake it down and run the guide wires.  We've used it a couple times, but not in any bad weather.  The mechanism is a little counter-intuitive.  The bars actually seem to fold backwards.  If it isn't used correctly, it seems like it would be easy to break, but once you know how to work it, we have not had any problems and the mechanism works smoothly.  Set it up about a half dozen times now.  Last trip we set it up, found a better camp site, broke it down, moved it and set it back up in much less time than we could have set up our last tent once.Door zipper seems to want to catch and the less than rugged design are the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars.

  It was easy to put and to take down. That's all the pros. The first time we used the tent, 2 zippers broke. There's also no (or extremely little) storage (and no hooks or hanging straps to add any). One of the 3 mesh pockets built in wasn't even a pocket, more of a vent, which I learned when I stored my headlamp in there and it slid down the outside front of the tent.

  Took a couple practices to get it figured it out but once you do it's very simple to set up and take down. I could probably even do it  in the dark after drinking now but wouldn't recommend that for the first set-up if you're used to the bendy fiberglass pole type tent. Used it for 8 days straight, no leaks during the rain, no bugs getting through the screens. Zippers seem to be holding up fine. I'm 5'8"" and can stand upright everywhere expect the corners which is awesome. Has a couple little pouches for storage. I guess the only downside is it's kind of heavy and bulky, you definitely wouldn't want to bring it hiking or carry it very far. And maybe one of those little zippers to run an extension cord through wold be cool but not a deal breaker. Overall great tent and I would recommend to a friend. Or a stranger shopping on Amazon.

  The ease of set up is the least of the joys of owning this tent! It took me only 2-3 minutes to set up the tent - alone. The door is off-set on the front of this tent, making it easier to come in and out without stepping on all of your gear. The zipper is hardy and the windows are generously large. I can stand up (mostly) in the center of the tent. The greatest feature of this tent is apparent when you go to take it down. It is a fast fold - like a folding unbrella. The tent bag has the surprise. On the back you can remove a strip of label to uncover a hidden gusset in the tent bag. FINALLY, a tent bag that is big enough to put the tent back in! I love this tent so much that I have been bragging about it to every camper I know. Don't be surprised if there is a backorder on these. They are THAT good.

  I received my Coleman 6-person Instant Tent and immediately set it up to check it out.  It's exactly as described.  After reading reviews, I opted to buy a fan to help with condensation issues.On my first camping trip, a 3-nighter in the Adirondacks, our second day brought us an issue with the tent.  We noticed that one of the roof hooks that connected to a front pole had a broken seem and the hook was pulling away from the main tent.  We hadn't experienced any high winds, and being only the second time this tent had seen fresh air, I was obviously upset that it lacked the quality I was promised.I unclipped the hook, and left it off, rather than cause more of a tear, and the tent appeared okay.  Rather than send the tent back, I'll find a way to fix it.The second day and night of our trip was extremely wet.  Heavy rains lasted throughout the day and night.  The tent did act as if it repelled the water but I will say that it was not a pleasant night's sleep.  We closed the windows and relied on the fan and ceiling vents to help with air circulation.  Obviously, there was some condensation, but it couldn't have been the sole cause of the hours of dripping water from the high point of the ceiling.All in all, I'm more upset with the tear in the roof hook then the condensation/leak issue in the ceiling.  It poured rain for hours all day and night and the tent stayed relatively dry, other than the dripping during the night.I've decided that on our next trip, I will set up a tarp over our tent so that we can sleep with the windows open and not worry about an annoying drip all night long.

  I give an extra star for being easy to set up which I’ll have to say was pretty cool at first.

  At first this tent seemed a bit too big, but I personally think that's its the perfect size. It's a 6 person tent if you get pretty close together, but it will fit 3 or 4 people no problem. We literally took it out of the bag and set it up in less than 5 minutes. I love how there are windows on all 4 sides and it is tall enough to stand up inside of it (but we are both shorter than 6ft). We did not have a rain fly so the morning dew made its way inside in the morning, but it was only like 2 drops. I'm sure a rainfly would take tare of that no problem. Also, there's two small vents at the top to help circulate air without compromising privacy. It also has small zip pockets inside for your smaller items. Also, in the past I have always had a hard time putting tents back in the bag and actually zipping it up. I have successfully set up this tent and zipped it back up in the bag without having to resort to breaking the extra release strap -- twice. Also, in the bag, it is fairly compact. I would definitely buy again. But make sure to get the rainfly if there's a chance of moisture.

  I've only used this tent once and it worked great. It feels comfortable with two twin air mattresses in side. I don't like that there are two zips on the front door instead of one continuous curved zip - it seems like bugs can get in easily that way. I also don't like that it didn't come with a rain flap.The plus side - it goes up in literally 30 seconds. It says two minutes but honestly you don't need that much time. I impressed everyone at my campsite with it.

I bought my first one 2.5 years ago, used it a lot, but it started leaking water both from the top and fabric. I learned NEVER to store tents in super hot southern sheds, and NEVER spray insect repellent inside of a tent! Super quick to put up and very spacious inside, great ventilation and very sturdy. PLEASE, COLEMAN, BRING YOUR AUSSIE VERSION TO THE US! (their's has a nifty roof panel/rainfly/front door roof attachment).

  I delayed buying this tent until the rainfly became available and in stock. It is kind of strange that the tent does not come with a rainfly. Although some say you can get by without the rainfly, good luck with that if it rains hard! Now that I have bought and used the 6-person tent (with the rainfly) I was totally impressed with how easy it is to set up: one person can truly erect this tent in a couple of minutes. It is well made and practical. Like all tents, you can only sleep 4 people comfortably in the 6 person tent. It is tall allowing one to stand up when inside the tent. The tent spikes are rather wimpy so I recommend you buy some decent stakes to use instead. The tent folds up fast and surprisingly, easily fit in its tote bag. I highly recommend it

I bought the rain fly to go with it just because I don't feel comfortable without a rain fly over me in a rainstorm.

I also read the instructions which it seems some of the people in the videos didn't do.  I took my time since it was the first time and it took about 3 minutes to get it opened up. I didn't stake it out or run guy-lines which would naturally add to the set up time.  I haven't received the rain fly yet so can't comment on that.  Looked it over to make sure it was all there, and it was. This tent is well made and will be perfect size for me and the wife. My first impression 5 stars.

  My husband and I are not serious campers, we really only get out maybe once or twice a year.  We wanted a simple and roomy tent (he is 6'3) but not so big finding a spot for it is difficult. We recently purchased and used this tent on a 4 day trip.  It is tall enough for my husband to stand in with a little head clearance.  We had no problem with moisture or bugs or whatever...but we were camping...water and bugs are outside...it is not a big concern of ours.  The ease of putting up the tent and comfort is.  This tent went up in maybe 2-3 mins.  We were comfortable on a queen air mattress with plenty of room for our bags and backpacks.  We did purchase and use a rain fly.  We had a fun four days and packed up and left in record time.  The tent was just as easy to collapse and roll up and setting it up.  We loved it.

    Great tent and no leaks
  
",4.0,Daryl,"Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2013","









  
  
    
  I usually don't review things but felt that I had to. I used to use a small Sundome tent and decided to buy this one for more room. It does set up very quickly, you can do it yourself even though the directions say to use 2 people. One reason I wanted it was so I can stand up in the tent, I'm not that tall but the Sundome is very small. The other thing was that I can put a queen sized air mattress in it and have more room for luggage or whatever. I only used it for 2 people, I'm dubious that you could actually fit 6, but 4 would work comfortably.I read all the reviews before buying and I saw all the reviews saying that it leaks in rain. I went ahead because I don't plan to camp in the rain. Well, the first trip, one of the nights, it rained, hard. We moved our chairs and a little table into the tent and ate our dinner inside the tent while it pounded outside. I was afraid of leaks and kept running my fingers down the seams but never felt anything wet. It rained for a couple hours and intermittently over night and not a drop got inside. So, I don't know if I just got a good tent or if Coleman listened to all the complaints about leaks and improved it.So, I like it a lot and would recommend it. The one thing to realize about it (this was sort of a problem in a couple camp sites) is that the footprint is quite large. The tent is 10x9 and the guy lines add several feet on each side, so if you use the guy lines, the footprint may be 15 feet or more in each direction. You can leave the guy lines off if there is no wind, I was just afraid that any wind would damage it as it is so tall.

  Setting up a tent isn't the most difficult task in the world, but it does require some time.  The Coleman Instant Tent is a great step in the evolution of the tent!  Initially I was skeptical about how ""instant"" this could really be but after watching a few setup videos on youtube I was sold.  When I got it through Amazon prime (free shipping!), I immediately opened up the box and set it up by myself.  It took me 5 minutes by myself the first time out without reading instructions.  Why take the extra time to get camp setup? Enjoy the outdoors and the experience without having to spend time putting together some poles.  There's enough room for me to stand up fully (I'm 5'10"") and while it could use a few more interior pockets and and a rain hood, overall I highly recommend this tent.  After both me and my sister have used this, we don't know if we can ever go back to non-instant setups!

  Great tent. Easy to put it together, 1 minute, and easy to put it back in it's bag. But make sure that you leave some ventilation in it, else you find some dew in the morning inside the cabin. Few questions I still have for myself: how does it do in the rain! Specially as when it rains, and you open the door, it might get wet inside, as there is not 'roof' above the entrance. And the frame on the outside might attract bird, leaving some dirt behind. And how about strong storms, it looks very shaky. Should be good for 4 persons, still don't know why all those tents are overrated, in this case 6 persons. Yes, will fit, when you are with a very 'close' group of people.

We set this up and was pleased with how easy but it was raining and we left set up for about 2 hours in a constant drizzle before we headed in to air up our mattresses & was surprised at puddles in the corners and water literally dripping down from the middle and all the walls were wet. Needless to say we had to sleep in car for the next 3 nights due to rainy conditions and a tent that just kept filling up with water.

  This tent was very simple to put up.  I was able to do it completely by myself in under 2 minutes.  However, it was not waterproof.  On a test run in our back yard, I stood in the tent in the pouring rain, and I could feel the water coming through the roof of the tent and onto my face.  I tried to order the optional rain fly, but it was not available.  Instead, I bought a $12 tarp and some bungee cords.  When it poured rain while we were camping, I was VERY thankful for the tarp.  However, rain still seeped in through the sides and we had water on the floor of the tent.... quite thankful we purchased cots so we were up off the floor.  I still really like the tent though, but wanted to be sure to make comments about the fact that it is NOT waterproof.  I know that tents don't really fit as many people as they say, but with three of us in this tent which is advertised to fit 6 people, we still felt cramped. I know this is part of the tent rating system, and not something necessarily bad about this tent in particular, so I didn't take off a star for this detail.  Overall though, I am happy with the tent.

  First off I also own the 8 person instant tent by Coleman, it is the 14 x 10 it is huge but nice. This 6 person tent was an very nice addition for the kids, very easy to put up, although I wish on the 8 man tent they would have have the cool zipper top openings for air they have on the 6 person. I love it, the six person design is nice, holds up well in wind and snow, however I always use a ground cover before laying the tent and a tarp on the top if I know its going to snow or rain. It does not have a rain fly, yet Coleman sells those too, and its worth the extra. Its tall so you don't have to feel scrunched when moving around in it either. We fit two portable cots, a mini fridge and all of our gear in it.

",5.0,C.Will,"Reviewed in the United States May 1, 2017","









  
  
    
  The main reason I bought this tent is because of its size and ease of setup. I am 6'6"" tall, so smaller tent shared with anyone else makes for an uncomfortable night. The length and width are long enough to accommodate me, even when sleeping at the edges. It is tall enough that i can at least stand up while leaning over just a bit. I cant fullt stand up in it, but i dont have to crouch down on my knees to move around in it.I decided to try the tent out for the first time this weekend while taking my son on a boy scout campout, without having ever taken it out of the bag, and without previously watching any videos or reading instructions on set up. It still was a very quick setup. It took about 2 minutes to set up and get the 6 stakes down, and that was with a lot of wind (this did not include the 4 support stakes for the cords. It took me another couple of minutes to get the knots undone and stake those down).  Takedown the next morning was just as easy. There was a bit of struggle getting it rolled back up to fit in the bag easily but that is the case with any tent ive had.The main reason i am giving it 5 stars though is because it actually made it through the night. We stayed at the very tip of Dauphin Island in Alabama. Inside Ft Gaines to be exact. On a weekend with a pretty big storm rolling in. Although it did not rain while i was there, the wind was blowing at 35+ mph for the entire night. I set it up around 6pm, and took it down the next morning around 7am and it stayed standing the entire time. This was not just an occasional gust of wind coming in. It was a steady 35mph, nonstop, the entire night. Occasionally there were some gusts that reached 50+ mpg. Every now and then, the top of the tent would shift and i thought the arms were going to give out, but they never did. I left all of the windows open throughout the night to keep some of the pressure of the wind off, but i think it would have stayed up even if they were closed.I did not have any leaks on mine, but it did not rain on us while the tent was up. There was a little spray from the ocean, but the wind was so strong it did not have time to sit on the tent and get in.Because of the design, its not a light or compact tent, but i would not expect one like this to be, so that's not a problem or negative to me. It will still fit in the trunk of a small car, so its not terribly long. I intend on using this on typical campouts with the family and do not intend on hiking long distances with it.There is only one negative thing about it to me, and that is the stakes that are included. They are the typical L shaped cheap tent stakes that come with every tent. I forgot to bring my good stakes with me, so i had to use these. Several were bent or pulled half up the next morning, so i will be buying another set of good ones to keep in the bag. I am not removing any stars from my rating just because it did hold up after all, even in the very sandy terrain i had it in. But it is worth noting that you should purchase a decent set, and that goes for any tent you buy.  While you are at it, go ahead and buy a small cheap mallet to keep in the tent bag too. Then you never have to remember to pack one, or have to hunt for something hard enough to drive them down.

",3.0,BN77,"Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2012","









  
  
    
  I used this tent for 7 consecutive days during a biking ride. The tent is advertised as an instant tent with easy setup and take down. This is an accurate description, as I found I could setup the tent in minutes, and equally take it down in minutes. Very nice.The tent as a whole is adequate for light rain protection.  Any storm with wind will cause the poles to buckle and the tent will collapse.  Your instant tent then will become an instant pool.  Tent should be setup in areas where there is shelter from straight line winds.The 4 person tent is really a tight 2 person tent or a comfortable single person tent.The windows and doors will provide adequate ventilation during the night if privacy screens are down.  However, if you zip them all up for privacy, it will become stuffy in the tent.I studied the product descriptions and reviews for the rainfly, and I don't understand what value the rainfly will provide outside of additional top layer protection.

  I took this camping with my girlfriend, and it does the job great. We had to move our campsite three times while camping and setting up and tearing down took maybe ten minutes. The inside is spacious, for two people, though I feel that four people might be a tight fit, though not undoable. I love the height of it. I'm 5'8"" and I can fairly easily get changed inside while standing, only needing to bend over a little bit.I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants a decent sized tent that has a super easy set up. It's sturdy, just like how you'd expect a Colman Tent.

  I love this tent!! I'm a festival girl so I live out of this tent about 10 weekends a year. I've had many tents before this one and this is by far my favorite. Many of my friends have purchased it since seeing mine. It's the perfect size for my glamping style.PROS-*SUPER easy, 1-2 person set up and take down! Seriously minutes and it's up*you can stand up inside it.*it's affordable. I found it on here for $99*it's the prefect size for a long weekend of festival camping. It fits a queen sized bed, suitcase, tubs, and a side table with plenty of room to spare and walk around.*stays relatively cool in the sun. it's got some vents at the top that help with airflow and heat*fits easily back into the tent bag with room to spare.CONS-*it holds up in the light rain and wind pretty well but leaked in a heavy downpour.*nowhere to hang things. There is only one little loop in the center of the tent that barely fits the hook on my lantern. It would be nice to see some loops or pockets high up and in the corners to hang lights on.my only qulam is that it came with a rip in it. I didn't notice until I used it for the first time. I patched it and it's fine but I would have prefered a brand new tent with no holes in it.

  I have both a 4 person and a 8 person.  ""Tent math"" applies so I use the 4 as a single for just me and my weeks worth of gear, but 2 would be comfortable with gear for a long weekend. The 8 is perfect for 4 people with gear.  Its as easy as they say it is, and the quality is top notch but thats what i have come to expect from Coleman.  Be sure and get the rain fly.  Both are heavy enough to use with a heater in cold temps, but with the windows open it will work for summer camping too.  Note: if you get the 8 read carefully the rainfly description, a lot of times stores skip this size and only have the 10.

    Quick set-up with some design flaws
  
",4.0,Brandon A. Steele,"Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2016","









  
  
    
  This tent comfortably fits three people. Six people fit only if you pack 'em in like sardines, with one person sleeping in front of the door, so it's not a comfortable fit. Height clearance is good for a tent. I'm 6 ft and could stand upright in the middle of the tent.We are able to fit a queen size blow-up mattress with room in the front and the side of the mattress. And, it could fit three over-sized cots.  Although it is advertised as fitting two queen size mattresses, that's really only if you squeeze them in, with no more room to spare.This is the Gen. 2 version of the tent.  Amazon sells the newer version (Gen. 3) of the tent for slightly more, listed as the Instant Cabin.  It has a slightly different roof shape design, and only one window on the door side (Gen. 1 and Gen. 2 have two windows).  I believe they switched from two to one window on the door side because two windows left slack in the tent material which made zipping the door closed sometimes difficult.  Basically, you have to pull the slack out of the material on the earlier versions to zip the door shut (which is easier to do on the outside than the inside of the tent).Very easy and quick set-up. Less than 60 seconds with just one person. The initial takedown is quick, but getting it completely folded up and in the bag takes some work, even with more than one person.On a side note, even though the bottom of the tent has tarp like material, I would recommend putting a separate tarp underneath the tent so that when it comes time to put it away it makes the wiping down of the tent easier.The tent is essentially water resistant. But, the first tent I received had to be exchanged, because it leaked water through portions of some of the seems.  The replacement tent (an earlier version / Gen 1) leaked both from some of the seems as well as the general tent material. So, there may be a quality control issue or you may need to spray the tent down with something like Kiwi Cap Dry heavy duty and then also seam seal.Although the tent is basically water resistant, and the door and windows have a small built in rain fly, this tent would be better if Coleman included a standard rain fly for it, as rain gets inside when, for example, you open the door fully to exit.  Although Coleman initially did not make a rainfly for this version of the tent, you can now purchase one for around $30.  I purchased it for my tent, and highly recommend it if you are going to purchase one of these tents.  It eliminates the problems of the roof vents (discussed below) and makes for cleaning the tent easier. Keep in mind that this is what is known as a single wall tent. That means that it will develop condensation on the inside from breathing. You have to be mindful where you set it up. For example, a setup near water is more likely to develop condensation. You can spray the inside of the tent with something like Kiwi Camp Dry to help with this problem.The roof of the tent has two vents, each opposite from another, that are secured with a flimsy Velcro strap. The first time I set the tent up there was wind, and the vents were oriented in the direction of the wind. Although the wind was not strong, it was strong enough to constantly open the vents because of the flimsy arms that hold them down. This created an uncomfortable draft in 40 degree whether. When setting the tent up you just need to be cognizant of where these vents are relative to the wind. Simply place that side of the tent that doesn't have the vent facing the direction of the wind.The stakes that come with it are low quality and you are going to eventually have to replace them as they bend easily. We replaced ours with high visibility (read: bright orange colored) stakes, made out of lightweight aluminium.The ad text an Amazon references ""back packing"" and ""dark room."" Neither is accurate. This is not even remotely close to a backpacking tent in terms of weight and packed size.  And, it even has quite a large packed size for a car. The 4 and 6 person tent pictured (and the one we received) are also not the dark room tents. The 10 person tent does appear to be the dark room, but that's definitely not a backpacking tent.One final point: in considering which tent to buy, don't just look at the cost of this tent, but also factor in the cost of new tent stakes, the rain fly, seam sealer and DWR spray (several cans over several coatings). Plus, the time you invest (couple of hours) in treating the inside and outside of the tent. In hindsight, I definitely would have went with a different tent.

",5.0,RamRod6,"Reviewed in the United States May 3, 2015","









  
  
    
  Exactly as represented. Two absolutes to start. 1) ALL tents, including this one, need to be FIRST set up at home, given 2 days of fair weather, and seamsealed and treated with weatherproofing spray. It will require two each of the seam sealing dauber and WP spray cans (An extra one of each if buying the rainfly). 2) Do not get hung up on the ""60 second"" gimmick. Take your time and open the legs for opposing corners at one time. Tall folks can stay on one side and reach across and pull each of the legs up on the opposite side. After extending each of the legs, you will want to peg out the corners to keep the footprint tight.Tips: Do the seam seal first and do the ""roof"" portion before extending the legs (also do the roof now with WP spray), so you can reach into the hub area. When doing the corner seams, pinch the fabric to one side of it to pull it tight while daubing it. Note the dauber, as it empties, will need to be kept tilted upward. Toward the end, finish the dauber off with the floor to wall seams as the dauber can be kept upright while doing it. Pay particular attention to the seam intrusions by the straps for pole attachments and guy line deltas. When spraying WP, spray vertical sections above the bottom of the windows, then from the windows down. As soon as it's all done, get the windows open. DO NOT SMOKE IN, OR AROUND, THE TENT WHILE DOING THE DAUBING AND SPRAYING UNTIL IT IS DRIED AND AIRED OUT!The door is a pain to close while tent is pegged out tight. Spray zipper with silicone lube (not WD-40) and GENTLY press in on the nearest leg corner while closing around the top corner.An E-port would be a nice addition as well as 2 more mesh pockets. Otherwise, i found the tent to be exactly as expected,Another point that was heartening for me was the fact that the tent, once staked out, including guy lines the tent has a perfect shape, just like the brochure pictures. It's all taught and in its place. All the videos, and pictures, I've seen, show sagging walls, pulled up floor, and a lot of lufting.Great tent that I'm sure will serve me well for years to come.Sorry, one more general item: I see a lot of questions and concerns for more dimunitive females and elders with bad backs (like me) about the setup of this tent. I'm 6'4"" and an old guy, lucky to be a bit more fit than some my age, and I can get this tent up in less than 60 seconds, if I want to. If I were a lot shorter or less coordinated or less fit or . . . . I still would be able to get this tent up in less than 15 minutes AND SO CAN ANYBODY ELSE. It's all a matter of which limitation slows you down, but there's not another tent that you can buy that will make camping easier for you and at a reasonable price.Try it, you'll like it.Update: 5-15-2016 Having set up and struck about 10 times in the last year, I can tell you that this tent is equipped to handle the realities of rough camping use and extreme weather. A surprise wind-driven heavy rain storm hit us hard while still fighting to set the large rain tarp up over one side of the tent. It tore the upwind tarp corner out of my hands and therefore fully one half of the tarp slammed into one side of the tent with force. The tent bent in more than a little on that side but stood in its footprint. When I recovered, I grabbed the tarp corner off the tent and again it was ripped out of my hands, this time blowing up and out over the tent. The tent then was subject to very heavy rain, driven horizontally by 45 MPH winds. Bottom line: NOT A DROP! Tent was undamaged and I spent the rest of the night getting little fits of sleep. All in all, it just added to the confidence that I bought the BEST all around car camping tent.Note that I bought the rainfly, not as protection from rain, rather as a guard against UV damage. Better to replace a rainfly than a most trustworthy tent. Going out this next weekend without the tarp, just to save time and because I don't need it.

  Could not have asked for an easier tent for using at a festival. The most dreaded part of any music festival is the breakdown of the campsite. This tent was a breeze to set up and take down! The other folks around us saw how quickly we were done and asked where we got it.Plenty of space for 2 grown men, though a bit snug if your other half insists on putting a queen  sized blow up mattress’s in.

  Definitely would not consider this a 6 person tent unless 6 skinny individuals in their sleeping bags fit. Probably a 3 person max. Hubby and I got this for a camping trip. It was pretty spacious with our air mattress. We slept with our two pups inside and our gear pretty cozy. I do recommend getting the rain fly cuz it saved our butts since it rained all weekend long while camping. I like that it has zippered mesh air vents to allow air in and keeps bugs out.

  Purchased the six man tent due to the size and ease of setup-takedown.  I used this during a weekend at the beach. The tent doesn't take any time to set up and take down was just as easy.  One word of caution:  It's easy to trap a finger in the assembly when you fold the tent up.  Take care to ensure your hand is free of the hinges when closing.  You do need to stake the tent and use the tie lines, otherwise the tent sags badly and you lose a lot of floor space..  I don't believe you can have two queen mattresses in the tent as advertise.  For one queen mattress the tent size is perfect.  The tent has enough height you can walk in and immeadiatly stand up.  One night it rained and with the windows partly open for ventilation we had some drips on the floor.  I would recommend purchasing the rain fly from Amazon.  Like others, I wonder why it's not included with the tent.  Overall for two people and two dogs, this is a great car camping tent.

  This is TRULY an *instant* tent. Me and my girlfriend can set the whole thing up in under a minute. I am 6'2, and can stand comfortably in ~90% of the tent, because of it's unique design.The reason I am rating it 4 stars instead of 5 is that this tent does not come with a rainfly, which is a necessity in my opinion. You do NOT want to be in this tent if it is raining and you don't have the rainfly for it.

  We bought this tent last year and used it for our camping trip. The tent was great in terms of the setup. It took us less than 5 mins to get everything ready. The next morning, we noticed small water puddles on our sleeping bags...it was strange, because it had not rained at night. It was just the water from the dew that had condensed on the tent. As soon as we woke up and the tent shook a little bit....it started pouring inside. This was completely unacceptable because our 8 year old 3 person Coleman tent has never leaked even when we camped for 3 days of pouring rain.We returned the tent and bought a regular 6 person Coleman tent.

Taking them out is always such a pain so I started searching around and found this tent.

We had the tent up in under a minute on the first try.  Repacking is just as easy although the tent was filled with air and had to be compressed before packing.  Finally!

  Just received my new tent and set it up.  Took me about 3 minutes because I was figuring out how to do it.  Next time it will take about 1 minute now that I am familiar with it.  It seems well constructed and while it says it is rain proof i will still go and get the rainfly when they are available.  I have never seen any low priced tent that didnt need a rainfly in a good rain.  I think some of these reviews are written by people that know nothing about camping.  If you want to be protected from the weather you need to use good stakes (not the cheap ones provided)and anchor all points well.  Then use a tarp or something as a ground cover so the bottom of the tent doesnt get punctured and a rainfly.  That is not just for this tent but all tents.  There are some tents that that dont need a rainfly but they cost many times what this tent costs. Actually saw a youtube video of this tent settting in inches of water and the floor was dry for what it worth.I recommend this tent for what it is a car camping easy to put up casual camping tent.

  If you like to go camping a lot, I'd say buy a better tent... this one is not very ""heavy duty"" and I think frequent use would render it into junk.  However, if you only camp a couple of times a year, this is a great value.It will fit a queen sized air mattress (the floor is 7' by 8' so it would theoretically fit a king size air mattress), and it does in fact go up in less than a minute.  If you set up your camp ground ""properly"" it will take about 30-45 minutes to finish... but if you just want to pop up the tent and climb in, it is only 1 minute away.Things I like... lots of ventilation... good for summer camping.  Nice big door and the bottom zips separately from the side and top... so you can run an electrical cord into the tent (we used it for a fan and a light).  The is a pass through spot near the roof and a place to hang a hooked light (I used a drop light and it was perfect).Major Problem... the rain-fly DOES NOT come with this tent and the tent stakes that do are cheap (!!!).  So you have to order additional pieces to get a complete tent set up.  To me that is a cheesy way of bringing down the quality of what would otherwise be a decent tent for occasional campers.Overall I would have given 4/5 because it works for me, but they lose a star for the cheap tent stakes and the lack of an included rain-fly.

The only negative it has (or doesn't have and it can be worked around) is not having a ground entry (except for the door) for a power cord should you decide to use a site with electric and it could use a few more hanging side pockets for a tent of this size.

  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this tent. I used a whole bottle of waterproofing on it before ever using it and was a very smart decision. When it does rain, the condensation still seems to seep in on the sides from place to place but it doesn't drip from the ceiling and it is not as bad as I've experienced in other tents. There is enough room to get away from the walls and sleep without ever getting wet. I love the ease at putting it up and taking it down. While you could squeeze 6 people in here (easily if it's all kids), I'll personally do no more than 3 or 4.

  I just got back from 2 nights of camping in a storm. ""Gale force winds"" according to the park rangers, rain so heavy that it scared my dog, trees falling down, etc. Amazon was sold out of the rainfly for this tent, so instead I bought a tarp on amazon and used that (10' x 12' Dry Top Heavy Duty White Full Size 10-mil Poly Tarp item #310122) which didn't need any additional ropes to attach, I just used some rope that the tent had attached that I assume was for the rainfly. The tent help up extremely well, there were two adults and a large dog in it and plenty of extra room. The floor stayed dry (despite pools of water underneath tent all night, so yeah, floor is waterproof), there was some condensation on the walls but that was probably partially due that we had all the windows closed. Pretty neat that it can be set up in 30 seconds too. I definitely would recommend the tent, unless you have to carry it a distance hiking beforehand, but then you really should be looking at smaller tents anyway.

  We've been tent camping for over thirty years. That said, we have the knowledge and experience to know quality tents when we have them.  Just bought this tent for a two night weekend trip. Two adults at a really well maintained campground. I added that part to point out that they prepare tenting areas with soft mulch material, and we use a strong ground cloth. We had queen size air mattress, that pretty much took up most of the floor space.  We never allowed shoes inside our tents. We closed up the tent and found a hole and tear on the floor material. I couldn't believe it. In all the years with three sons and large dogs using our tents for 2-3 weeks at a time, we never wore out a floor!  We only replaced them for larger ones as the boys grew. Very disappointing. I loved the quick set up. I loved that it has a solid material roof and Windows that can be opened from inside.  The door zipper was a problem turning the top corner.  You need two hands and it was still difficult. I was afraid that would break.  Never expected the floor to tear.  Poor quality material.

The only thing you're struggling with is rolling it to get the air out. And it wasn't even a struggle, it just took longer than putting it up and taking it down - all together LOL.

For a tent that size the head room is great, I'm 6'-2"" and with a slight lean forward I could get dressed standing up.  My son and I used it for a Cub Scout camping trip, and he thought it was awesome.  To say this is a 4-person tent is a bit of a stretch, unless it's four Oompa-Loompas.  To get three full-size sleeping bags in there would make for a very snug fit and cozy evening.  I'd definitely recommend this tent for the occasional camper or young teen.

I agree that it this tent could use more hooks/loops/pockets for interior storage, but that feels to me like a pretty small issue. For the amount of space, ability to stand up inside, and the manufacturing quality this tent is a very good deal and I would definitely recommend it.

  First time taking it camping the whole tent leaked from the seams, walls, and roof. It lasted through the first night that was a bad down pour but the next night with a light rain was leaking all over the tent. I used a seam sealer a couple of weeks prior to camping I can only imagine how bad it would have been without it. Only up side is how easy it was to setup. My wife and I were able to open and have it setup within 5 minutes.

  took out the tent for the first time WITH the RAIN FLY out to the Oregon coast and with light rain, there was water droplets inside the tent, and with heavy rain, there was water seeping in from the seams.

  Rain fly and tent are great at keeping out the rain.  Roomy enough for 3.  2 folks fit comfortably in it.  I usually camp by myself and it's great.  I use a tarp under mine to save from floor wear.  vent at top helps with reducing condensation inside.  Full zip up windows help hold in heat when it's cold.  When ""glamping"" in the summer a portable ac unit works great in it.  I love how easy it is to set up and take down by myself!

Fits multiple cots and camping junk in a way that a liberal arts degree in feng shui isn't required to enter.  6 person is a little weird.  Fits four cots with little room between to step over people.  We fit one cot, a dog bed, a hammok, a chair and a cooler in there with no problems.

  We just got back from our first ever camping trip.  I bought this tent a couple of months ago and we ""practiced"" inthe backyard a couple of times.  Set it up, sprayed it with a hose, took it down, etc.I had read many reviews and quite a few said the tent leaks, so before we went I did spray it with waterproofer and sealed the seams just in case.  It rained on and off for the 3 days we were camping with a very windy and powerful Florida thunderstorm thrown in for good measure.  It didn't leak a bit.  I made sure the top vents were closed good as I saw where rain could probably blow in there, but it didn't at all...maybe we were just facing the right way.We also had a fan going and I noticed that the 3 sides of the tent where the fan blew against stayed bone dry, while the side at the back of the fan that got no air did feel damp (although no water dripped through).  So I'm wondering if the leaks people are getting are really from condensation.We used a queen and a twin air mattress and had room for a small walking space and 3 large plastic bins of stuff.  There is a good amount of room for 2 adults and a child but I wouldn't want anymore than that in there.  There's a loop to hang a lantern in the ceiling which we used, and 2 pockets.  We only used the pocket that is right by the door, it was very handy for the flashlights, keys, and other stuff you might want to grab on your way in and out.The windows are nice and big and roll down into themselves.  They stayed put even with a good wind.  They are at a height where you can leave them open, yet still have some privacy while you are sleeping.Setup and take down is a breeze.  They aren't kidding when they say it only takes a minute.  Be careful you watch where you put your fingers so they don't get pinched!  The bag it comes with is nice too, as it all fits back in there easily.  I thought it was very sturdy, the poles were definately more substantial than our camping partners regular tent.The only thing I don't like about the tent is the door.  It is shaped like a ""D"" and the zipper doesn't go around the top right curve easily...and I'm afraid if anything is going to break it will be this zipper.  You need to use both hands to zip it, one to pull the fabric together and one to zip.  You also have to be careful when opening the door when the outside of the tent is wet because the water will run inside if you don't hold it just right.  We kept a small towel by the door to clean up when that happened.We will be buying another (probably the next size up) so we can bring more people next time.

",3.0,Thomas,"Reviewed in the United States November 16, 2012","









  
  
    
  I was very impressed with this tent when I bought the first one about 4 years ago, it was easy for me by myself to put up and take down, but very bulky, but I like to camp out of the back of my 4x4, in the most remote and secluded camping spots I can find. The front door zipper went out on the first tent, would not close properly, and Colemen, sent me a brand new one free of charge. Now I have used the new one for over a year and the front door zipper went out again, I tried crimping it down, but it still failed, then would not work at all on my recent camping trip, luckily I had a small spare tent to sleep in. I believe for regular use, this tent will do fine, I like its inside size, and room to stand, and the ability to close up all the windows. Have used it through many strong thunderstorms and it did fine, just a lot of condensation on all the walls, as well as when I use my tent heater, its like a sauna in the tent when its below 30 degrees out, very comfortable. I also feel the poles are a bit fragile, they have not broken yet, but sometimes bend the wrong way when I am laying the tent out, and its a lot of work getting it back in the carrying bag, but it will fit tight after a lot of stuffing it in. I  hope not to discourage anyone from purchasing this tent, I think Coleman is a very reputable company, and they even replaced a canopy I bought from them, when one of the plastic brackets cracked within the year warranty. I would purchase another tent from Coleman, and will try to get a replacement zipper to try and fix the door so it closes properly.

  We took the tent out of the packaging, and from that point, it took 35 seconds to set up.  This tent rocks!  The rainfly I ordered hadn't arrived before we left for our trip, so when a wicked storm hit (and lasted for hours with buckets of rain blowing in every direction), I was afraid the tent was going to be a wet, leaky mess.  Not at all!  When I opened the tent, about two tablespoons of water dripped in from the top vent.  Other than that, it was dry as a bone!  This tent is easy to assemble, roomy, and keeps the rain out when properly zipped up.  The large windows keep it breezy and comfortable when it's not raining.

  This Coleman Instant Tent is so easy to assemble and disassemble.  I can set it up in minutes.  Taking it down and rolling it up tightly enough to fit in the storage bag takes a few more minutes.  I use three small bungee cords to roll it up nice and snug.  The rainfly accessory that goes along with the tent needs to be purchased to keep the rain, dirt and sun off the top of the tent.  That too is easy to assemble and I keep my tent stakes  and hammer in the zippered storage bag for the rainfly.  There was plenty of space.The 4-Person tent is very roomy inside and I use a queen size air mattress and a milk crate turned upside down next to the mattress for a night stand.  The mattress and the crate take up the width of the tent but the two make bedtime very convenient and comfortable.  I'm 5' 6"" and cannot stand up straight inside the tent, but I can stand with my head bent, which is much more comfortable than crawling around the inside of a low dome tent.I've taken this tent on about a dozen camping trips so far and haven't had any issues with it.  I did replace the included tent stakes with heavy duty stakes which hold up well in the wind, not because I had an issue with the included stakes but because I had heavy duty stakes available.This is a durable, easy to assemble tent, and for me it was well worth the investment.

What is really disturbing is that water percolated in several places away from the seams, as if the material had pin-holes in it.  Clearly, Coleman cannot claim that the material is water-proof.  It is not.  I will keep the tent, but will apply seam sealant throughout and Scotchguard on the fabric. I am an experienced camper-from desert to rain forest.  I have no issues spending a few nights out with just my poncho, and I don't expect to be bone-dry during a camping trip.  However, I cannot recommend this product because either Coleman misrepresents the water-proofing, or has serious problems with quality control.  This is not acceptable.

  Two problems, (1) two sides of the tent don't have tiedowns so when the wind picks up the sides cave in. I had to use a couple rocks to weight them down. (2) The material of the tent is so thin on-top that when the sun is beating down  the suns rays and gets very hot. If you could put an extra dark material on top it would help prevent this.

    Tent is not tight, does not sleep 4 comfortably, and is bulky.
  
",3.0,V. Yalung,"Reviewed in the United States April 23, 2012","









  
  
    
  I kinda like this tent, but still feel like it needs some improvement.First, the ""fit and finish:"" The tent material drapes very loosely, even when staked down. It has a cheap wrinkled appearance to it, unlike a tightly fitted internal frame tent that stretches the fabric so that the wrinkles come out and water doesn't get trapped in them. I suppose it doesn't make a huge difference in how rain-repellent it is, but it looks cheaply made. We went camping with a half dozen other families for Boy Scouts, and our tent was by far the least attractive. It was cool for the first five minutes, we got the expected ""oohs and aahs"" from our friends after it set up so quickly, but no one, including myself was impressed after that. We purchased a rainfly for the tent and had it overnighted because the weather report showed heavy rain and thunderstorms. The rainfly was definitely useful, but I can't understand why they wouldn't have included it with the tent. You have to fork over another 25 bucks to Coleman to get it, even though you can buy a 15 dollar tent at Walmart that has one included. Not cool that Coleman would do that.Second: The bulkiness of the tent negates its overall usefulness. We have several tents, one of them a cabin style 10 person tent, and that tent bagged up is only slightly larger than this one in it's bag. If you have a small car or a lot of gear with not much trunk space, this one will be a hassle to pack up. Obviously, the reason for the bulk is that the poles are thicker and the canvas, since it's attached, can't be folded and packed up tightly, and these are just the disadvantages of having an instant tent. Gotta take the bad with the good.Lastly, 8x7 does not sleep four adults comfortably, so if you're looking for a four person tent, go up in size. My 4'11"" 100lb wife and I and our two boys, 9 and 6 barely fit in this tent, and we didn't even have our gear stored in here. We used a Coleman double high twin bed that turns into a king size when un-stacked, and that fit perfectly in the tent, but I had elbows, knees and feet jammed all into my body both nights we were in camp. I can't imagine it would even be tolerable if four undersized adults slept in here together.To sum it up, I think this tent is just okay. I like that there are no pieces to lose, and that it goes up quickly, which is a big advantage when setting up at night or in the rain. When I go fishing with my sons for the day, and just need something to store gear and rest in, this tent will be perfect. However, for overnight camping, I'll probably keep looking for something better. There are less expensive tents that take only a few minutes longer to set up that are more useful than this one.

   I purchased this tent because the description stated that no rainfly was needed and truth be told I was tired of dealing with rainflys. Tents should be waterproof from the factory. This tent was not waterproof at all. The reviews that say things like ""I sprayed it with a garden hose"" and give it 5 stars before they even USE it should not be allowed. The middle of the tent was soaked because even though the top vents have covers (that were closed) they allow enough moisture to get in that it collects on the screen and drips. The bottoms of the walls were also pooling with water from windows. Also, when you open the door the water that collects above the door drains into the tent. If we had not had the tent on a platform I am sure the bottom of the our mattress would have been soaked. BUY A TARP OR RAINFLY FOR THIS TENT. I am guilty of having many expensive electronics along with me on ""rustic"" camping trips and if you share my guilt do not make the same mistake I did. My laptop was in the fifth wheel camper or else it would have been destroyed. My clothes and battery chargers were damp but not harmed. I have purchased a tarp and seemsealer for the tent so hopefully I can waterproof it. I do feel this tent is designed well other than the problems with leaking. It sets up in less than 60 seconds and they give you a big bag to put the tent back into so that takes maybe a minute once you get all the air out. I would give this tent 5 stars if it came with a rainfly and did not make false claims.

  I bought a 4 man's instant tent ,Coleman. I was impressed the article arrived quickly. My husband set and collapsed it w/out  help. I wouldn't be able to do it myself .  There is a flap above the  tent just in case it rains. It fits 2 cots which were purchased @ amazon as well. The gears and personnal luggage can be stored under the cot to give room for an aisle. The height is just right for changing his clothes.  I am five feet and He is 5'10. It may accommodate 4 people if the occupants are 2 adults and 2  preschool kids. My husband likes it. The plan is : it will be used twice a year. Looking forward to using it next month (September 2013) .Suggestion: If you are looking for a 4 man's tent , get a 6 man's tent. This will  fit  4 sleepimg bags and enough room for their backpacks and personal belongings. The 4 man's tent description should be changed to a state two man's tent, not four. Cres

  Retired and tent camping around USA for over 4 years.  The previous model had 2 hubs on the roof making setup and tear down much easier than the new single hub roof.  The previous model also came with a rain fly.  Now you must buy it separately.  You must have a rain fly to stay dry!  Coleman must not compare old vs new when field testing.  Not a true “cabin” tent with the single hub in the center of the roof.

  I bought this tent for a canoe trip. I single handedly set it up in under 2 minutes. It breaks down just as easy as it goes up. 4 people in this tent would be quite a squeeze.It did not rain on my canoe trip, yet the walls of the tent in the morning were completely saturated and dripping into the tent just from the morning dew. Thank God it didn't rain or I would have been swimming in the tent. Even if you purchase the rainfly to go with this tent (it doesn't come with one for some strange reason) everything inside the tent is probably still going to be wet in the morning just from moisture in the air.I wish I could have returned this tent but its too late now. Don't make the same mistake I did and jump on this purchase.I hate to give a review like this because Coleman generally produces a great product, but I was so disappointed in this tent I had to warn other buyers.

The real test came on the second camping yesterday with a 2 hour rain overnight which caused seepage of rain water through out all 4 sides of the tent.  Thank goodness the ceiling did not leak due to the rainfly on top.  Using 6 towels, we removed approximately 3 gallons of water from the floor of the tent.

Survived a rain storm first time we used it no problem. Would be nice if there was a least a slight overhang above the door. You can't open it without rain getting inside. But fortunately there is plenty of room inside- for two people anyway- that you have space to get in and leave your wet stuff away from your sleeping area.  Overall an awesome tent for the $.

We also have a large family tent but I wanted something smaller that would set-up and take down quickly for weekend hunting/camping trips with my son.  The very first time I used the tent I had it up in less than 30 seconds!  It's that easy! It is well sealed and retained nice interior warmth for the cool weather we were camping in.  It took a bit longer to take the tent down, perhaps 2 minutes, but it easily fit back inside the bag.  It's definitely small for 4 people, but perfectly roomy for two and three would be do-able (this is what I expect when purchasing tents, so no surprise there).  It's a bit on the heavy side, but if you're camping next to your vehicle this tent is ideal.  The materials seem very durable and I expect that this tent will be great for many years to come.

  I bought the 4 and 6 person versions of this tent.  I have taken them both camping one time.  I have experienced severe rain in both of them.  I had to send the 6 person tent back because of a malfunction in one of the poles, but it was easy to make it work for the 5 days I kept it out.Setup - Very easy, my daughter was able to set hers up without any issues what so ever, took her a little more than a minute, but very little effort to get on of these set up and staked out.  We did not use the guy lines, the tents were pretty stable through high winds and heavy rain.Takedown - As easy to take down as they are to setup, rolling them up is a little awkward with all the poles attached, but they both still fit nicely inside the bag they come in, even without have to expand the bottom.Rain resistance - I ordered the rain fly for both of these of tents.  I knew rain was coming, so I put them on.  I did not feel a single drop of water through the roof.  The sides stayed dry on the inside as well.  The bottom did not let any ground moisture through that I could feel.  Just be sure not to leave things pressed against the side of the tent or you are guaranteed to get water through the sides.  And never ever buy a tent without a rainfly if you expect to stay dry.Comfort - It's a tent.  How comfortable can it be?  I like the size of the 6 person, It could hold three people with plenty of space to spare, 4 very close, 5 or 6 I can't imagine any room to move about, but it could definitely fit them.  I'm 5'10 and was able to stand in the 6 person.  The four person fit my daughter just fine, and would be great for two people.Complaints - Only complaint I have is the zipper on the door gets a little tough to pull at the corner area.Overall, pretty good tent.  I feel like they will last a very long time if taken care of.

  If you need to camp out now and then and are not too graceful with assembling tents etc this may be just what you need.  I am often a single traveler and got it to take to different music festivals where camping is almost required because of the remote location of the festival.  I had my doubts but setup was quick and easy, I had it set up and on my way to the main stage area within 10 minutes.  Ok it wasn't the one minute setup they said was possible, but at the same time if you saw my last attempt with the flex rods on a dome tent you would be a believer as well.  Teardown is a little more cumbersome because you have to get all the air out of the tent, but leave your windows partially unzipped and it goes a lot faster because the air has more areas to escape.

  My significant other and I are not campers (as in never been camping since the 6th grade science camp). Although we were invited by a friend to celebrate her birthday by camping. So I decided to research the BEST and EASIEST option for a tent. Since we were not advent campers and both of us had continuous physical back and knee ache I wanted to make our experience the least taxing on our bodies.We purchased this tent watched a video on youtube on how to pitch the tent...sure enough we had it up in a SNAP! We fit a queen size double stack blow up bed and there was still room walk around and stand up straight. Even our 6' tall friends felt this tent was spacious.The one negative is that this tent does not come with a rainfly. Our last night camping it was really windy and rainy and water did seep through the seams of the windows. Kinda annoying. So definitely purchase a rainfly for this  tent. Outside of that we love love loved IT!

I set ths tent up in my backyard before a storm to see if it would leak or not. My tent was blown over by the winds. The poles stayed erect, so there was no failure on there part. After changing out the tent stakes, it stayed up fine, and didn't leak. It was a pretty light storm that went by, I will be trying it out again with some more intense storm just as soon as they come to me.

  I like this tent but have two major complaints about it:  1) the square doors don't allow for easy zipping; and 2) the black color draws more heat inside the tent.  Aside from those two issues this is a decent tent.  Good size, stayed dry during a rainy day, and has good ventilation.  I wish Coleman would have left the ""round"" shaped doors as was on the older models.  I also purchased the rain fly but didn't put it on the tent even during the rain.  I may return the rain fly.Update.  Used this once and one of the top knuckles broke off the center pole. Of course my warranty has expired.

  Can't beat this tent for ease in set-up. It TRULY sets up in an instant, without hassle. Nearing darkness when we arrived at our camping site, we didn't have time to spare. This was our first use (other than trial-run set-up in our back yard); it performed splendidly. We had already sprayed the seams with weather-guard, so we were prepared for the rather steady rain we encountered on the last night of our trip at our second stop. Truly, no leakage occurred (although we kept a towel bunched up by the door as previous reviewers had said to do). The next morning after the rain, some moisture had accumulated on the inner walls because of condensation, but my hubby and I absolutely remained dry throughout the night. We were very thankful for this tent. I believe we will buy the 6-person so we'll have a tad more room for changing clothes and moving around, but to ""make do"", the 4-person was absolutely all we needed. It was cozy and allowed plenty of room for our air mattress and for sleeping. Like the pockets for storing necessary items such as glasses and tissues. Very thankful for this tent. We would have no hesitation recommending it.

  I purchased this tent to replace a Kelsyus OGO 9 x 9 tent, which also has an integral frame and erects in a similar manner:  stake the four corners, then raise and lock the center hub.  This tent was very easy to set up and take down.  Working by myself, it only took 20 minutes to spread the ground cloth tarp, set up the tent, attach the rainfly, then take down and store the tent.  It has enough room for two cots and a small table between them.  I would rather have the door in the center instead of on the right-hand side, but it is still usable.  I like that the windows and doors will all close completely, thus making the tent easier to heat in the winter.  This was a key factor in my decision to purchase this tent.

  I couldn't believe how incredibly simple this tent was to put up.  It literally takes less than 5 minutes from the bag to expanding in place,  another 5-10 min to stake it.  The inside is roomy and you can walk around in it without stooping over.  It got wet during my first camping trip with it.  I folded it up, put it in the car.  Once I got home I set it up (again in 5 min) to dry it out.  It does take effort to fold it up and pack it in the bag.  The only gripe I have with this and any other tent is the carrying case needs to be a little bit larger to make packing it away easier.  Overall, I am very happy with this tent.

  This tent is as easy to set up as advertised.  We've used it three times and have no complaints.  It hasn't been put to the weather test yet, but we're trusting in Coleman.  To improve our chances of keeping dry in a storm, we are using seam sealer and silicone spray.  The only feature we plan to add is something to attach to the zipper pulls that will glow in the dark.

  We have a family of two adults and two little kids. We thought that with a 6 person tent, we'd have room to move about a little more. My husband and I set up a cot each for us, and the kids were on the floor with bags, and it was tight quarters. If 6 people were only in there with sleeping bags and no other gear or packs of any kind, they'd all fit. (However, if it rained and nobody wants to be next to the condensation on the walls, it'll be extremely tight)  We should have gone with a bigger size tent.Other than that, it was super easy to assemble. Very quick and convenient to put up and take down. Rained all night last time we had it out, no leaks that we could see! Good for the price!

I set it up as instructed with the video with exceptional ease.  I did have a little trouble folding it back up but figured it out.  Let's be honest.  All tents are nuts to butts regarding how many they claim to sleep.  Comfortably this tent sleeps two.  It claims 4 but it's worth the setup time as nobody wants to deal with mosquito's.  I wish the door would be bigger as you have to inflate a mattress inside it and can't slide it through the door.  For the weekend warrior it's hands down a great buy!

We have camped in 45mph winds outside Zion in this tent and no troubles even while my friends expensive tent got bent out of shape.The tent has many clever features that help make it even better including pouches on the walls, large windows, roof vent, sturdy materials, and wind tie downs for big storms.

    Not Rainproof At All
  
",1.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2017","









  
  
    
  This tent completely fails in its role of providing shelter from the elements.  On the good side, it is very easy to set up and quite spacious.  There are no frills, but that is not necessary in a tent.  The zippers are acceptable, though not robust.  That is about it for the good sides.When the windows are zipped, there is no circulation at all and it becomes a sweat box.  That would almost be fine if it meant that the tent was robustly waterproof.  It is not.  On my family's very first time using the tent, it rained.  It was admittedly a steady, long-lasting rain, but it was not torrential by any stretch.  The tent was not waterproof.  Not even a little.  Despite using the sold-separately, but matching, rainfly and having the windows zipped up tight, after an hour or so of rain, nearly every surface of the inside of the tent was wet.  That was not even the worst part, in the middle of the night, I woke up, very wet, and trained a flashlight on each of the four corners of the tent, and each was a waterfall with rain pouring through the seams in each of the corners of the tent and creating rivers of water on the tent floor.It is a hundred dollar tent, I didn't expect it to be perfect, but it didn't even sort of keep the rain off and that seems to be the bare minimum to actually call something a tent.  In addition, it looks like Amazon might not let me return it.  So, yeah, I would skip this one.

  I really like this tent because the floor is made out of a tarp-like material so it is pretty durable.  It rained a lot when I used it and yet no rain leaked through.  We also bought the rainfly but it is nothing special and doesn't cover the windows so you may want to put a tarp overhead anyway. Minus a star because the rainfly could be better (sold seperatly)  Also, it is more like a spacious 2 person tent but could fit more tightly.

  Set up is a breeze, really it is. I think the first time we set it up it only took about 6 minutes. Everything is so easy. I don't think I'll be able to go back to another form of tent ever again. The space on this one is good. I don't know how comfortable it would be to put 6 people in here but i suppose it could be done if you didn't have to place any gear inside as well. For me and my wife on a blow up mattress with our bags and a dog it was perfect. Lots of head room too which is nice.

  If you go camping occasionally or just want a nice tent on the beach, I would highly recommend this tent. Literally takes less than a minute to setup. You just take it out, unfold the arms, and the tent pops up into shape. It's very roomy for two people, but fitting 4+ will start to get cramped (this is true for most 6 person tents though). It's a little hard to stuff it back into its bag, and once in, the bag is larger and heavier than similar sized tents from REI. That's the tradeoff I guess.

  I recently went on a 400 mile bicycling tour and we had to pitch our tent every night after biking 60 plus miles. Needless to say, I didn't want a tent that was a struggle to put up when I was tired. This was the easiest tent to pitch and it took me only a couple of minutes. One night it rained all night and I kept dry.My only reservation in not giving a 5 star review, is that I had trouble folding it small enough to fit back in the bag....I bought the 4 man tent and in reality, it would suit 2 people at best.In conclusion, I think the people at Coleman are genius!

    Exactly What I Was Looking For
  
",5.0,ljs,"Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2012","









  
  
    
  I tend to go camping on my own, because I find most of my friends lack  interest in camping.  I like a roomy tent I can stand in, but most tents that can be set up by one person on their own are neither roomy nor tall enough even for me to stand up in (I'm only 5""6).  This one works on all three levels.  It really can be set up quickly by one person on their own, although a minute may be a slight underestimate of the time it takes.  For one or two people it's quite roomy, though more than three adults would be cramped.  I have no trouble standing in it, though a six+ footer would have to crouch a bit.  The only flaws I found is that it would be nice if it came with a rain fly even if it doesn't really need one, and it's not as easy to refold into its case as I might like.  This last is pretty much true of every tent I've ever seen, though.  This one is probably better than most because it wraps around its poles.  All in all, I have no trouble recommending this tent.  I'm looking forward to being able to take more road trip vacations and spending  more of them camping instead of having to find motels.

",5.0,K. Levin,"Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2012","









  
  
    
  I opted for this tent because the overall consensus was how very easy it is to put up. Yes, it really is very, VERY easy to erect. We are a family of scientific/engineering types, so not the very least likely to succeed with putting up a tent, but we are also not very advanced campers. With some experience (less than one camping trip per year) but not a lot, we found this tent to be super easy to put up, even with 5 and 8 year old children distracting us in the process.We used it a couple of times in the backyard first. No real problems there (except a nervous preschooler who decided to ""go back home""/inside before 9pm.) When we were planning a class camping trip with other families, I warned my husband, ""the reviews say this tent is great, EXCEPT IN THE RAIN"" so we planned to just pack up early and leave if the weather turned bad.Well, living in New England... we got a pretty intense thunderstorm during our three night camping trip! The shelter over the picnic tables was leaking. One (out of five) families just packed it in and left at dusk when their tent started to flood. The weather reports the next day actually stated flash floods occurred in the area where we camped... but we slept pretty darn dry in the Coleman 6-Person Instant Tent! I would say there were two very tiny spots of water infiltration from above. We definitely had one child who rolled to the side and got a damp sleeping bag due to sleeping in contact with the side of the tent. HOWEVER, even without the rainfly and with no tarp covering us, all in all, we had a dry tent. This far exceeded my expectation for how well this inexpensive, easy-up tent would handle serious rainfall. (It POURED in the evening, then rained softly to moderately throughout most of the night.)We did luck out, by arriving last in our group, in having the highest placed campsite at our New Hampshire state park. The coziest seeming sites were definitely downhill from ours when the weather turned bad. The site did seem pretty flat upon initial visual inspection, though. The soil was sandy, so the rain water was able to sink it fairly quickly, thank goodness.Aside from weather resistance, our family of four found the interior space of this tent comfortable. We use the self-inflating (backpacker style) camping pads by Therm-A-Rest (

  
Thermarest Luxury Map Air Mattress, Blue









  
  
    
   in the 30-inch wide XL size for the adults and much smaller 3/4 length pads for the kids), so we aren't crowding the tent as much as household sized thick air mattresses would. It was snug but comfortable with our beds deployed and a few duffle bags with clothing. We had room to move between our beds, but we only use the tent to sleep and get dressed.Having read all the reviews, I brought a few wooden clothes pins to use to keep the window flaps from flapping, and I had zero issue with any noise or inconvenience with the windows. I am very easily disturbed by things like fluttering flaps.As others have written, it sure would be nice to have extra loops or pockets in the tent for storage, but, again, I knew what to expect and just kept a little tote next to my bed with my LED lamp, eyeglasses, etc. At this price point, I found the tent completely satisfactory as far as features were concerned.I wish there were a footprint sized precisely for this tent. I worried about water infiltration all night during our heavy rains. I was able to fold a standard tarp to fit neatly underneath the Coleman 6-Person Instant Tent, but I would have paid a few extra dollars to have a tarp that fit perfectly like a proper footprint does.I am pretty likely to buy the new rainfly accessory for this tent now that it is available. As I said, our experience was very positive in a pretty significant rainfall, but I did sleep poorly worrying that water was going to come in during the night. I have also strongly considered some kind of easy up shelter just tossed up over the entire tent to stop the worst of a deluge getting to us...In a nutshell, I am very satisfied with the Coleman 6-Person Instant Tent. It met my highest priority, which was a set-up so easy that tent-anxiety wouldn't keep us from heading out for a camping trip. The five-star review is because FOR THE PRICE, this tent wildly exceeded my expectations. I would be using much more stringent requirements (pockets, conveniences) if the price point were more than just barely into the three digit range, like the Paha Que, Mountain Hardware, etc. tents that I covet but could not justify for our infrequent current usage. This is a great place to start if you are a family considering camping but not ready for big cash commitments. In that scenario, IMHO, spend less on your first tent and a little more to ensure you have good sleeping pads (cushioning) to avoid physical pain/misery, warm enough sleeping bags, and good basic cooking equipment so everyone can enjoy themselves.

    Great 3-season tent, but that is NOT a rainfly
  
",4.0,Saffron the Paisley,"Reviewed in the United States March 14, 2015","









  
  
    
  This is a roomy, 3-season tent, but I would not share it with 5 people. I did share it with 2 dogs and a cat (with crate and litter box) and that was plenty of company. Lots of big windows that zip open, the better to catch breezes and views from all 4 sides. There are two, tiny, eye-like screened vents on the roof that also help ventilate. The sides flare outward from the top so if it rains, you must completely zip up all those windows. And don't forget the door. Not a good situation if it's also hot and humid, or you have company and it rains for more than an hour. Coleman calls its two, tiny, roof vents a rain-fly. In no way do they count as such, so I would strongly suggest getting yourself a 10' x10' tarp (at least) and some clamps to throw over the top. I used a 10x25 roll of clear plastic and fixed up a covered entry area. This also helps muffle the sound of being inside a popcorn popper when it rains. That's only fun for about 5 minutes.I folded a 16'x24' tarp in 1/4ths as a ground cloth, and ended up buying some foam tent floor mats for the dogs.This thing does go up very quickly and easily by one person, leaving plenty of time to be amused by nearby campers wrestling with 24' long fiberglass poles and sleeves on flimsy, lightweight tents.This is a car-camping tent, way too heavy and large to pack in anywhere more than maybe 100 yards from the vehicle. By the same token, it's not going to fly away easily, either. Feels substantial.It doesn't pack down quite as quickly as it went up, but I was staying for a week or two at each campsite, so it wasn't too much trouble.Took me about 1.5 hours to completely break camp, including walking the dogs.I found this tent a very satisfactory investment, had lots of fellow campers inquiries and vows to purchase. Just be sure to fashion a rain fly. The ones for sale do NOT look useful and are way too expensive, anyway.Happy Camping!

  Easy set up and with the rain fly we stayed perfectly dry as it rained for 3 straight days.  Folding it up, not easy.  No instructions, so after a while figured it out.  To make it pack away easier, leave a window open otherwise the trapped air makes it difficult stuffing it all back into the carry bag.

  On the 8-man instant tent by Coleman, one of the reviewers said that these were not instant tents.  I don't have the 8-man but this 6-man tent was definitely instant, and if you don't think so, then you probably have a hard time making Easy Mac, because this tent is ridiculously easy!In my small living room (read: barely fit the tent), I set it up by myself for the first time in exactly 4 minutes, and that includes taking it out of the bag and even removing some of the initial packaging.I can't comment on it's use as a tent, but it seems solid.  It does only have 2 pockets, but if you know that going into it and are fine with it, then this is definitely an awesome tent.  Like most tents, the person count is a bit generous, but I don't know of any tent I researched that had reviewers say you could fit the amount of people it said you could, and still have room for stuff.  That's part of buying a tent.Seriously, if you need or want an instant tent, buy this.  We have a fussy/needy baby, and so I knew it may just be me putting up the tent, or maybe 5-10 minutes with my wife and I, and so we needed a tent that wouldn't take forever with 1 person or limited time with 2.I cannot wait to go camping in a month!

  This tent, while not quite ""instant"", was easy to put up. It was spacious inside. I liked the nearly upright walls which make for stand up height almost anywhere inside. It rained on my trip and I found that, with the windows closed, the tent was pretty water tight. I believe you can buy a rain fly (it doesn't come with one) that would make the tent more useful in inclement weather. The major flaw in this tent is that it folds up to a pretty large size when taken down. Can take up a lot of packing space in your car or truck. I would recommend checking it out in person before ordering.

  NOT GOOD!  I read reviews and being a Coleman guy I discounted the negative ones because I have always been happy with Coleman.  They missed the mark on this tent big time.  Setting up was easy enough, but was not worth the trade off of poor wind design.  While setting up this tent for the very first time I noticed concerns.  The rain fly does not attach well to the tent poles.  The guy lines from the tent poles to the ground push up on the rain fly.  There are no anchor points on the sides, neither the bottom to keep wind from going under the tent or at the top to reinforce the sides against wind pushing the sides in.  So, first night up...  Mothersday weekend 2017, we are on the lake, 2:00am, 18 mph winds pick up and the left side of the tent buckles in.  Fighting the wind to push the tent back to open the door I get out side, in the dark trying to push the poles back into place... unable to see what was going on and fighting the wind I gave up and moved my wife and I into the 19 year old 4 person Coleman with the kids.  The next morning I was able to rotate the legs back out from the center point on the top of the tent.  The next night the wind picked up again, this time the tent didn't buckle in but the fabric flapping, and the anticipation of the tent collapsing keep us awake until the wind finally died down.  I will attempt to return this tent.  I'm going back to the old design until they workout the kinks with the instant set up... and might still avoid it...

  Great tent, NO JOKE less than 5 minutes from getting it out of the bag to fully stood up (no stakes in the ground or groundcover/rainfly installed.  Once you understand what it takes to open this tent up you can do it in a snap.This tent is big enough for 2 twin air mattresses and *some stuff.  I had 2 small backpacks inside with an auto battery jumper box to charge my cell phone.  You can't really stand up in it but its a space for sleeping, not much else.I bought the rainfly, there is no excuse for not having one when it rains.  It should be part of the package on this. Water seeps through any tent material when anything comes in contact with the outside walls.  That is the nature of these kinds of materials and has been for years.  A rainfly prevents the water from ever settling on your tent in the first place.I highly recommend buying groundcover that fits. It doesn't have to be fancy just something to keep the bottom clean and from coming in to contact with water flowing across the ground.  Keeping the tent clean, dry and free of organic debris when stored is critical.  Leaves/organics break down and weaken the tent material while they rot if it is put up dirty.  The key to long lasting tents is to store them in a clean, low humidity place inside your home and put them up completely  clean and dry inside and out.  Doing so will keep any tent from mildewing and/or from being ruined by organic material rotting against them.All and all I am happy with this purchase for a 2 person camp out as an alternative to our family sized monster tent with 15 poles that have to be assembled when its put up.

  I am recently into the idea of camping and going out to enjoy nature all the time. Earlier, I had a cheapish tent which we went out on a beach camp once and it was a disaster. After taking 1 hour to set it up (agreed it was first time) it was extremely suffocating inside.After deciding to take a quality tent, I was about to take another Coleman regular tent for 2 person when one of my experienced friends recommended this instant tent. I was a bit apprehensive initially to believe that instant tents really work.But, went ahead by having faith in his words and now, I truly thank him for that wisdom. As I said, I am not a experienced camper but, I was really able to set this tent in 2 minutes up and ready. I couldn't believe myself of how easy it was.Though it is said to be for 4 people, it is the best tent for a couple. You can have enough space to keep all your gear and still sleep peacefully. I got a queenbed as well to fit in this, but haven't tried it yet.So far, the experience was superb. I haven't seen how it fares in rain yet, so, will update about it later.

  This tent wasn't a hard sell, I read a lot of reviews on this tent, both good and bad. As far as the leakage problems I read about. It all comes down to being prepared for rain. Colman ""Weather tech"" is good on its own, but you need to give it a little help to stay completely dry. The rain fly is the first step. I know, I know, it should come with the tent. Well this irritates me as well, but I paid the extra twenty five, because I live in a rainy climate and I hate damp bedding. I took this tent out of the box and had it set up in under two minutes. I bought some good water-base seam sealer, and a large can of camp dry. I went over the entire tent, every seam, with the sealer. I let that dry in the sun for an hour. I then sprayed the tent with the camp dry. With the sealer, be sure you do all the tie down straps along both sides next to the tent. Brush the sealer under the edge of the seam, and on top of the stitches. The seam has to look wet to be sealed. Do along the bottom seam and the corners last using up the last of the sealer. I gave these, three coats. The rain fly cover has already been seam sealed and water proofed so you can use it right out of the box. Let the tent set up for at least two hours to dry. The odor will go away as well. Note; DO NOT SPRAY THIS CAMP DRY INSIDE YOUR TENT WITHOUT A RESPIRATOR. I see no need to do that anyway! I ran the hose over the tent for five minutes strait, spraying water in all directions. Not one drop of water got in!! I will put a blue tarp over the tent when I go camping as another line of defense. I say let it rain, you always have blue skies when you have a big blue tarp.

  We needed a new tent so when I saw this I thought how hard could it be. We watched the video at Coleman on the set up. They say you can erect this tent in 1 minute. It took us about 30 seconds. We purchased the 6 man tent for the 2 of us and a small dog. I ordered a queen size mattress. Fits good with room to spare. There's plenty of windows in the tent for ventilation and opens on top for air. Coleman now sells a rain fly for the instant tent after complaints of not having one. We find ours to be well manufactured, no flaws. Perfect for us. We haven't had rain yet so I can't comment on leaks. We had no problem taking it down and folding it back up to fit in the carrying case. My husband used to jump with parachutes so he's good at folding camping items to fit their cases. I'm very impressed with this instant tent and would recommend it.

  It's as easy as the description says to put this tent up!  My husband didn't believe it would be so easy, but we had the tent up and ready to go in 1-2 minutes!  Putting it away took about 4-5 minutes, but now that we know how to collapse it and pack it away, it'll probably only take 2-3 minutes next time.  If you and your partner tend to fight when putting things together, this tent is well worth the money!  It was SO easy, I don't know why anyone would buy a tent where you have to feed the poles through the tent, etc.We fit 1 queen airbed and 1 twin airbed perfectly, with about 2+ feet walking room between the beds and plenty of room in front of the beds for your bags/luggage.  Perfect size for my husband, myself and our 9 year old.  Can probably fit two queen airbeds, but may be a little cramped, but still enough room at the end for everyone's bags, shoes, etc.  Love that you can stand up in it, too!We were in a foggy area, so the outside of the tent was wet in the morning, so we're going to buy a rain cover ($30) for our next trip, although it didn't leak or drip at all.  The material is really sturdy and with a brand like Coleman, you can trust it's going to hold up for many future camping trips!

  It does go up in short time, and it is well-built.The instructions reveal that it is designed to be put up with 2 people.  That would be good to know before I purchased it for single use.It has no rain-fly, and the PR makes several statements about not needing one, but it does.  If you use this tent for any serious camping then take a tarp to cover the tent with and plan to make a rainfly, for it will be needed.  When it rains, I cannot open the windows or door or the the water will run in and on a hot day it can get stifling.Coleman makes equipment that looks good, but I wonder if anyone takes this gear out to use it before it goes to production.  This tent has much good to its design, but it has no interior hooks, for instance, and they are really useful.I find this tent very awkward to roll up and put away, altho it collapses well.This is an excellent product IF you are willing to work on making it functional.James the Obscure

  Received this tent after a 2 day delivery with Prime.  Unit was well packed and shipped.  Watch a Youtube video before opening at home.  Always like to test before using items away from home.Tent was easy to get set up and take down.  Did both easily in 15 mins while I took my time.  Will use this Memorial Day weekend at the lake but if all works there like it did in the backyard, I will be very happy.Always been able to trust Coleman products.

  This tent is awesome! I'm 5'3 and I can put this tent up or take it down in just a few minutes. Something you should know though, is that if you want to put 6 people in there, you won't be able to move. We put in queen and twin size air mattresses with our back packs and it was comfortable.  We had about a foot between the mattresses for a  walkway.

  This tent easily accommodated two adults and 3 children with room to spare. The setup and takedown could not be easier. It was less than 3 minutes to setup and takedown from car to campsite and back. Lot's of headroom, windows, screens, and high quality zippers. Fortunately we did not encounter rain during our camping trip, so I can't comment on the effectiveness of its supposed built in water proofing. However, you can purchase a separate rainfly specifically for this if needed.

  We weather proofed the tent as soon as we bought it. True to the advertisement it's the easiest tent I've ever had the pleasure of setting up. On our very first trip out we survived one hell of a storm and stayed high and dry, so I think weather proofing must be the key to having a good experience with this particular product.

    Bad A$$ tent!
  
",5.0,Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2013","









  
  
    
  I would recommend this tent for anybody!  It's so cool setting it up because it takes around 10 minutes MAX.  This leaves your camp mates jealous, as you will be enjoying cold beverages whilst watching them still setting up their tent.  Literally though--- After laying down a tarp on the footprint (the tent does not come with one) the tent pops up in about 2 minutes, securing the poles and staking it down takes another 3 if you hurry.  By the time you get it set up just right and you move onto another project you will spend around 10 minutes setting up your temporary home.The only con is the take-down and bagging the tent back up.  It's a bit of a pain in the a$$ to get the poles just right to fit in the bag, but the bag is rugged and you can really force it in.  It isn't bad enough to doc a star however, and with this being the ONLY downfall of the tent, I would still recommend.

  I bought the mid-size option b/c I like to have my space to stretch out and whatnot. It is an awesome tent and a great idea, but I think the smaller one would have been better for me since it can be hard to set-up and take down alone. I also bought the optional rainfly, just in case. I haven't had any problems with leaks, but I have had a flooded tent (in other tents) too many times to not have an added precaution.

The price is just about it's range though if you're looking for the alternative buy look for Ozark which is good also.  The thing I don't like is how expensive it's rainfly since not included and you need to buy it separate if you want to.
