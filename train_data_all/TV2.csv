    Great TV
  
",5.0 ,Jennifer B.,"Reviewed in the United States August 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  Very pleased with this TV.  Really like the Roku feature.  It was easy to set up. I have Netflix, Hulu and Prime and it was easy to put in my passwords and have access to them.  Plus a lot of other short cuts and features.  I needed a smaller TV for my cabinet and this fit perfectly.

    Does not work with Spectrum
  
",1.0 ,righthefirsttime,"Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2021","









  
  
    
  We bought this tv for our workout room, and intended to download the Spectrum app for streaming our cable channels. Despite this listing’s claims that the Spectrum app is available on this TV, it is NOT! Those are false claims. Turns out, Roku decided not to renew their contract with Spectrum, with zero consideration for millions of their customers who get their cable and internet from Spectrum. So we cannot stream our Spectrum channels on our brand new tv. It’s worthless and being returned. My opinion of this company is filled with four letter words.

    Everything I wanted in a value TV

  No, it doesn't have ALL the bells and whistles that you might get with some TV's, but given that it's got Roku built in, it's got most.  The roku remote as TV remote takes some getting used to, but that's more of a psychological thing. But there's really nothing at all I can complain about. I got the 1080p (not 4K) version and at 40"" the picture is all I could ever hope for. The brightness is very good and you can even adjust the darkness of the background. The number of ports it has is outstanding even though I will at most only use 2 HDMI.  I was even surprised by the packaging.  I noticed there were a couple 2"" long holes in the front of the box so I was nervous of damage.  It was fortunately packaged with a foam cover, not very thick though, but sufficient that there wasn't a single scratch much less a break.Lastly, I want to comment on the weight.  This is the lightest TV I've ever picked up.  I live in a 3rd floor apartment and have lugged both a foam mattress (90 lbs) and an oversized bean bag lounger up those stairs.  I was dreading bring up the TV.  I'm not exaggerating in the least when I say that I could carry it with one had.  The box has 2 handles and I only used one taking it from my vehicle to the stairs.  Obviously I was more careful on the way up, but in my apartment, I literally picked up the tv with one hand to put it on it's low stand.  It was a strange feeling.TL;DR: Great TV, more than I expected, super light and I would recommend it to anyone and probably will.

  Roku is so easy to set up. I had it connected to Amazon, Netflix, Youtube, Hulu, etc. in a few minutes. Great sound and picture. Only small complaint is the remote is a little cheaply made, but it hasn't broken yet. Also the legs for the TV are spaced very far apart, just a few inches from the edges, so it just barely fit the shelf I put it on. But all around great value, very happy with it.

    Caution TCL quality isn’t the greatest, new tv fail after 3 months
  
",1.0 ,EGUM,"Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2021","









  
  
    
  Brand new TV failed just after 3 months, took 18 days to get fixed even though TVL guarantees 10 days.  It was an assembly problem on a resistor.  TCL will not offer a warranty over 1 year, so if you buy these  CHEAP TVs, then you must purchase the extended warranty,, I would not purchase another TCL tv.

    See pictures: Perfect TV for a non-theater type home setup. Simple and intuitive with a nice picture
  
",5.0 ,James C.,"Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2019","









  
  
    
  This TCL 40-inch TV offers a great solution for most casual home setups.  We have put it in our closet like armoire that had been previously accommodating a fifteen year old standard definition 42"" plasma TV. That old plasma had been handed down from our family room a few years ago when we upgraded.  The problem was, it required we keep an extra cable box setup in our bedroom at a cost of $11/month.  Since we infrequently use the bedroom TV it did not make financial sense to keep the cable setup and as a result we sacrificed a usable TV.  This TV was a reasonable investment whose upfront cost would offset the cable box setup in a little over a year.  We also now have Netflix, Youtube, Amazon Music and many broadcast channels from the internal antenna jack and all the app channels we care to add on (ESPN, News, etc).The installation was simple and required nothing but another device with an internet connection to verify connections/logins (I used my iPhone).  The remote control is simple to use and the TV's interface is simple to navigate.  For a simple home setup, this TV is perfect; with its nice HD picture, simple interface, reasonable price and internal speakers.  This was well worth the purchase for our needs and I would recommend this TV for all but those looking to use it as part of some glorious theater setup.  Should any issues develop as time goes on I will update.  A picture is attached for reference.

    Nice TV for the price, but with a strange quirk.
  
",4.0 ,Philip White,"Reviewed in the United States April 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this TV for my upstairs family room. It is a nice little set; especially for the price. I Also control most of the media devices in this house using Alexa. I have a Roku attached to my TV downstairs and I works very well using the Alexa skill. - This TV is also listed as Alexa-compatible. It is EXCEPT that for some unfathomable reason I will not switch to NETFLIX using Alexa; a message come on the screen saying to use the remote. - I don't have this problem on any other Roku device I own.  The other odd problem is  the Roku remote. Normally these are wireless, but this one uses IR and so the control needs to be used line-of-sight.  - Hope the Netflix problem is a firmware-related thing and they get it fixed. Other than that, It's a nice set, especially if you have speakers or a sound bar. The built-in speakers are kind of tinny.

",2.0 ,Pseudobliss,"Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2021","









  
  
    
  I got this for my bedroom; small and easily hidden in my armoire. It was priced good for budget.  Most of this tv is great. However, it is exceedingly slow to respond to remote.  It will “hang” with just a “twirling” icon for minutes before every button I've pushed to get the tv to track the remote suddenly speeds through the tv.  There again, it’s just my bedroom tv I use when it’s late and just want to fall asleep watching a late night prime show or listen to YouTube.  I’d shop around if this will be your primary flatscreen.

  I bought the tv back in August after reading a couple reviews I wasn’t sure but it was in my budget and I Went ahead and ordered it let me tell you it’s a good tv. I don’t know if these problems could be due to WiFi connection problems. However it’s like any other device it will lose signal to the control, freezing up on you. Log you out of its apps without fully loading and return you to the home menu . Switching between apps (ex. Netflix to Hulu, etc.) the volume is different and you have to readjust or sometimes the audio cuts out completely for a time period on a certain app . (Ex. Hulu, Netflix, Disney+ ). These are just problems from time to time overall it does it’s job and is a decent working tv. Hope this helps .

  Definitely a good product for the price!! I was expecting to just have to ""settle"" for this product because I thought a smart tv with a built in ROKU for $180 for a 40 inch was a little too good to be true. I've had it for about a month and I'm please d with everything about it... I wish it were bigger but I knew the size upon purchasing.. It's super easy to download apps and easy to navigate for people that aren't tech savvy. I've heard it's fragile to move so I've saved the box and Styrofoam for a move that's coming up.. Will update once it's moved! :)

  First of all.... I HAVE to say that monitors of ANY sort, television or computer, are ALWAYS measured DIAGONALLY for screen size. I have the screen size at 40 inches as depicted in the first image. This was eating at me with reviews that showed the screen being only 35 inches when measured horizontally.Super easy to mount and set up. Weighs next to nothing! Already had a Roku installed in my daughters room before and I needed to replace the television because it was super old and broke, so I decided ""Why not a Roku TV?"" With a second set of hands I had this mounted and working within an hour. We have a second Roku TV in the living room, not sure which brand, but that one has worked flawlessly for two years.Having zero issues with it staying connected, we currently have 600mps through our cable internet router as everyone streams or plays games online. I went ahead and got the fastest speed available solely for this purpose.Picture and sound absolutely blow me away at this price point and I figure if it even lasts a year then I've scored big time. I cannot speak on longevity at this moment obviously, but I am super happy with this purchase!

  For the price, you don't really expect to get such a great quality tv. The volume is good quality (I love to blast a movie when I'm really into it and I didn't have to put the volume all the way up.) I got the 40"" screen which fit perfectly in my space. It was very easy to set up (granted, if you're technological and know how to connect your streaming accounts) and I was watching ""Friends"" on my new TV in no time. It connects to your wifi first, and then you hook it up to all your streaming services. Easy as pie.

",4.0 ,Liam,"Reviewed in the United States November 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  All in all, a really nice TV especially for the price that you pay. Picture quality is great, and the smart functionality is what you'd expect coming from Roku. Tons of streaming services / apps to choose from. Remote is simple and works well enough. Only gripe is that the software + remote can bog down a bit sometimes, causing momentary lag and stuttering as you navigate through the menus or homescreen (especially Netflix seems rather intensive).Those are just minor complaints, though. Nothing that a quick reset can't help with. Would recommend if you are a college student who needs an affordable smart TV that works really well for the price.

  I am amazed at the value this tv has. For what you pay for there is a lot to like. The picture is crystal clear, format is intuitive and easy to use. Wifi picks up 2.4 & 5Ghz which is great! Setting up Roku apps was simple and easy. This is a fantastic upgrade from my last TV. It wasn't a smart TV and was only 720p. The remote is very straight forward and laid out well. I really like the devoted buttons for the apps on the remote, but it would be nice if it could be reconfigured as I don't use 2 of them. The only thing I don't like is the placement of the volume buttons. They are on the right side. If you are left handed I can see how that would be convenient, since that's where the index & middle finger would naturally be, but it's odd that they chose this perticular location since 90% of the population is right handed. The volume button placement will take some considerable adjusting. Despite that one issue it's not affecting my 5 star review.

  This TV is suffering from several problems and possible poor design decisions. It is slow to respond to all commands, it can take up to 2 seconds for a volume up or down to be processed. Youtube video's will freeze and get out of sync with sound. The same affects Hulu, Netflix, Prime and all other apps. A severe freeze will cause it to reboot by itself. It is as if they put the same processor for the smaller version of the TV into this one and forgot it has to decode much higher resolutions.I am hoping some of this will be solved in a firmware update, but if not, I will probably switch to a different brand next time.  The only reason I am giving it three stars is because this TV is dirt cheap and you get what you paid for.

    Very Nice TV
  
",5.0 ,Critical Thinker,"Reviewed in the United States April 20, 2019","









  
  
    
  The Good:1. The TV is fairly easy to setup. I only had one hiccup and that was when I installed the Roku app on my phone and tried to use the remote control feature. The app couldn't connect to the TV at first, but after restarting both devices it worked fine and continues to work fine. Oh, and I should also note that I had no trouble connecting the TV to my 5GHz wifi.2. Using the Roku app you can take advantage of your smart device's keyboard and voice recognition rather than having to type things using the remote control's arrow keys to select one letter at a time. This is a HUGE win for me, I hate typing things one letter at a time in this manner. You can even use your smart device to provide user names and passwords for streaming services in this way, which is VERY HELPFUL. I can't praise this feature enough, very nice.3. The TV is very responsive. Selecting things with the remote is quick, very little lag time between my button press and seeing the results on the screen. I hate interfaces that are too slow, so this is another BIG win for me.4. It doesn't weigh that much for being a pretty big TV. This helps with wall mounting.5. The wall mounting screws are VESA 200x200mm so that makes using a wall mount quite easy.6. Picture quality and volume seem great, though I haven't watched it that much yet.7. There is a setting to turn off the standby LED light. This is a simple feature, but a great one if you want the room dark when the TV is off.The Bad:1. The TV only came with 2 of the 4 screws needed for wall mounting. The wall mount I purchased, however, did have 4 compatible screws with it so I simply used those.2. The power cable is too short for my situation. I installed it above a dresser in a bedroom so I needed the cable to reach the floor (ideally) but it's too short to do so.Other:You do have to create a Roku account to use streaming features with this TV, but it is completely free. You can OPTIONALLY add a credit card in case you want to use premium content features. When signing up it can look as if you are required to provide a credit card, but there's a ""skip this"" type of link at the bottom if you don't wish to.

",1.0 ,Sonia Flores,"Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  Ventajas - Desempacas súper rápido, instalación de las patas bastante fácil y muy ligero en el peso.Desventajas - el control de mando no tiene teclado numérico, es demasiado complicado el buscar canales. Compre el tv de regalo para mi mamá que no sabe manejar la tecnología imaginen lo difícil que es para ella buscar los canales. Adicional el control ya está dando problemas de manejo en el botón de encendido y los botones de subir y bajar él volumen, se dificulta el manejo. Y solo lleva unas cuantas semanas de uso. Lo que significa que el ahorro en la compra del tv se pierde en la compra otro control remoto ya que el original no va a durar mucho. Mi marca preferida es Samsung pero sus precios van llegando a la Luna. No podría pagar por ellos por esa razón busco la economía.Otro detalle es el volumen - el sonido es muy bajo y hay que subirlo a 25 o 30 para que se pueda apreciar las voces (no hay problemas de audición en mi casa) .La imagen - los colores son extraños para ser un tv 1080p la mejor imagen se puede apreciar de frente al tv si vas a unos lados del tv los colores se ven más blancos.En conclusión no lo recomiendo. Para los que puedan comprar las marcas elite sería mejor invertir un poco más.

",5.0 ,Phillip,"Reviewed in the United States September 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  I wanted to get a smart tv that would allow me to watch Criterion Channel and MetOpera on Demand. This works well for these and a number of other streaming possibilities. The Roku channel (the basic version to which there is no subscription fee) has a lot of things worth watching especially if you like tv series from the 1980s.I was able to hook up my old Samsung bluray player to this tv and it works very well.Also, I wanted good stereo sound, so I purchased a TCL soundbar. My kids were stunned at the roar made by the Star Destroyer at the beginning of Star Wars, and operas come through very well too. The soundbar is a fraction of an inch higher than the bottom of the tv, but you can set it up right in front of the tv without blocking the picture at all, as long as you are not looking upward at it; neither does the soundbar keep you from controlling the tv with a remote, as long as you angle the controller correctly. (If you do have the tv positioned at or above eye-level, you could solve the problem by positioning the legs of the tv stand on a one-inch piece of wood or something.)Perhaps the TCL smart tv and soundbar will not be good enough for really demanding viewers/hearers, but I think that I have average standards and they are well met by this equipment.Additional comments, November 2020: Several months after purchasing this TV and the soundbar from the same company, I am still quite happy with the purchase. I've decided to add some statistics in case they'd be helpful to anyone...TV height not including stand: 20.5"" (screen height:  19.25"")TV height including stand: just under 22.75""TV length: 35.5"" (screen length: 34.5"")Surface needed for TV to sit (i.e. footprint): 30.5"" length, 7.5"" depthHow far apart are the feet: roughly 28""Surface need for TV + sound bar (i.e. footprint): 36"" length, 12"" depthBottom of screen (not bottom of TV) just under 3"" high if using standsound bar height: about 2.75""

  I had high expectations for this TV. The picture quality is good and has all the streaming channels I have a subscription to. It worked well for the first few weeks but now I am noticing somethings I simply do not like. The Roku Tv seems to time out very often and become unresponsive. Something as simple as changing the volume causes a delay and the tv will not respond. If I click a streaming channel it will take minutes to load and then the Tv will randomly restart. We just bought an LG which we have had for months now and don’t seem to have these problems. I was loyal to the TCL Roku Tv but I will never buy one again.

  The title of the item here is 40"" TV.  The box it comes in says 40"" TV.  Then you take it out of the box and from one edge to another it' measures 36"" and that includes the plastic edging.  The screen itself is approximately 35"".  I was immensely disappointed.  The item looked nice otherwise, so if the sizing I described is something you would like, by all means go for it!  But there's not a darn thing that even comes close to 40"" with this TV.

  No numbers to select channels on the Roku remote. If you have only an antenna, I can't imagine how you change channels! Maybe just up and down, and you won't have that many channels. No luck with programming a Harmony 650, but luckily my Uverse S-10 series remote works perfectly. I can switch back and forth between Roku functions and the cable box, control the sound, power, etc. Picture and sound are very good. Pleased for the price.

  I first bought this one for my bedroom and I liked it so much I bought a 49” for my living room, and another one for my son. Now - I want to drop-kick this thing into someone else’s house, not worth the headache of e-recycle. It constantly freezes up and the Roku half-brain re-starts, always at the crucial moment of whatever I’m watching. The remotes have never worked. At first I liked the remote feature on my phone, but god forbid your phone dies. Also, the app freezes up and I have to constantly force quit sland reload it to get anything to work, then wait and wait for it to connect to the tv.., over and over. I spend way too much time on this whole process. The whole thing is just too irritating. Save up a few pennies and buy something better. Update - now it won’t work at all.

    Looks nice but a few annoyances w/ remote and smart software
  
",3.0 ,Frank BobTop Contributor: Pets,"Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2019","









  
  
    
  Good quality TV, sound and picture, but there are a few things I dislike about using it. The remote has to be aimed just right at the sensor, meaning most of the time I have to press buttons more than once to get them to work, and it doesn't work from the other side of my living room which is apparently too far away. That's really annoying. It also doesn't ""remember"" the last device it was on--for example, if I'm using the Xbox, turn off the TV and then come back to it later, it has returned to the home screen instead of remembering the Xbox input. Finally, the Roku is slow and has a slight yet irritating lag. Makes it pretty hard to accurately use the remote to click through Netflix options or input letters on the keyboard, etc.

  Bought: 40 inch Roku TVPros:Good picture quality (for price)Lightweight to mountGood features (sleep timer, speakers, etc)Cons:Remote Uses inferred, needs to be clear to tv unlike roku units which use a frequency.Processor is slow, takes some time to surf Netflix and such, has frequent “error loading” messages.Light on bottom of TV when turned off, light is off when tv is on. Seems backwards and is actually decently bright.Overall it’s a good tv for the price we pay. It’s great for a tv you only use every once and awhile.

  I was Leary to purchase this at first due to the low price, but was convinced by the reviews. Picture quality is great and the Roku interface works good.  The remote is a little small and hard to hang on to, other than that it is a great buy. I just placed another order for my sister.Update: After using this for awhile I have some insight and suggestions for anyone who is considering the purchase of this and future models of this TV. When I first received this, I had some trouble with the remote so I purchased another remote (thinking that was the problem), well it wasn't. The remote receiver in the TV was to blame. By this time it was too late to request a return, so we just have to live with it. The symptoms are when using the remote you have to keep changing the angle at witch you are pointing the remote at the TV in order to get it to work, very frustrating. If you have this problem, request a replacement immediately. I purchased another unit for my sister and she hasn't had a single problem with hers, so I guess I got a lemon.

  This is a great bargain TV that gets it all done. I've bought only TCL Roku for years. However the last two 40 inchers I bought within the last two months have arrived with the digital part of the screen cracked. No visible damage but when turned on the picture is cracked. They only ship it in the TV box, no extra cardboard box. Just bought same TV from Walmart.com and it came in an exterior box and works great. No more TCL TVs from Amazon unless they get there packaging straight.

  Did not know about Roku when we bought the TV, and we already had Amazon Fire and Dish Network.  We generally like Roku and can access both Dish and Amazon very easily, in addition to the Roku channels. Picture quality and audio are good, not outstanding, but that is at least in part because of the quality of the streaming sources.SO, PROS: (a) TV attributes (picture/audio, inputs and some features) -- (b) use of HDMI -- (c) navigation to channels and other features -- (d) Set up (I don't even remember setting the TV up so it must have gone smoothly).CONS: (a) stand design requires long narrow cabinet (TV feet are about 30 inches apart). We have a corner cabinet that's not wide enough, so it requires a rather precarious construction using narrow/small pedestals like bricks. Eventually, we need to get a specially cut board to resolve. Previous TV had one pedestal with large oval foot that worked really well -- (b) some settings are awkward to use and some are hard to find. For example, depending on the programming, you need to toggle closed captions (CC) on and off (think foreign language films). It is awkward to do this -- (c) An annoying characteristic of streaming services is that each channel and the over-all TV settings all work a little differently, so you're constantly trying to figure which remote and which buttons on the remote to use (we have to use 3 remotes). This is only marginally due to the TV/Roku characteristics but they contribute to the overall confusion (think non-technical wife).Over all, we like the TCL/Roku TV and would recommend.

    Scam Alert, Be Very Careful
  
",1.0 ,pistolpetereview,"Reviewed in the United States August 25, 2019","









  
  
    
  Two very bad things about this TV. First, I already had an Amazon Fire TV device on my existing TVs, and the reviews on this TV said you can use a Fire TV Stick with this. Let me assure you that it is a nightmare to set up, and then barely functions with the Firestick. Secondly, the original code that TCL sends to set up my TV did not work, and I was given a number to call and a web site to visit to get a new number. Well, the web site I visited and subsequent phone number was a scam designed to mirror the official TCL site. I had read the directions specifying that there would be no extra fee charged to register the TV with ROKU, so when the representative said there would be a fee, I challenged her and asked to speak to a supervisor. She said she would ask someone to call. While waiting, I checked the paper copy of the instruction manual, and noticed the phone number in the manual for TCL Product Support did not match the number on the web site I had visited. I finally did get the official TCL representative, and she confirmed there was a problem with a scam web site. The TV seems to work fine now, but the risk of falling victim to a scam is very high. Please be very careful if you decide to buy this TV.

    Slow, unstable, and unresponsive
  
",2.0 ,Josh,"Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2021","









  
  
    
  This TV is incredibly disappointing. This TV was purchased to replace another TCL Roku television that was starting to get a little long in the tooth. The old TV would frequently lockup, apps would crash, especially Netflix, and would experience a variety of other performance issues. Some of these issues have seen a very mild improvement over the old set. However, the performance of this new television is extremely poor. The system is generally slow and unresponsive. The set responds to the remote control has if it were a suggestion rather than a command. Apps frequently are generally unresponsive and tend to lockup. The TV feels like a computer with not enough ram to run the system. The connivence of having a Roku built into a TV is wonderful, only one remote control for example. However, if I had to do over again, I would have bought a dumb TV and a separate Roku.

  I was going to buy the 43"" size at Target, but they didn't have any in stock. It was recommended by one of their employees over all the other brands, so I ordered the 40"" from Amazon, which was my preferred size to begin with. We have a small house and super sized TV's are not our thing. The first one delivered was crushed, which Amazon knew about as they started the refund before we even brought it in the house. It shouldn't have been delivered in the first place since it was obviously crushed, and it's been a hassle to get Amazon to pick it up. Still dealing with customer service on that, as they missed the original pick up date. But this isn't a review ofAmazon's service (just an FYI). The replacement TV is great. This replaces a 10 year old TCL, so we were already happy with the brand. It's a TV, what can I say? I guess if you want to spend a ton of money, you can get a better one, but I think it's got great picture quality and sound. We're not using the Roku remote. Instead, we're using the Firestick so that we're using the same remote on all our TV's.

  I’ve had this tv since January. Pros to it are the price and the optional modes for the picture and sound. It has plenty of hookup spots in the back and it’s super light.The cons to this are Roku. It seems like this brand always has bugs and has a habit of freezing and randomly restarting etc. it can get pretty annoying. There have been times where I lose patience and just plug in my amazon fire stick to the back and use the apps through it. Another con is the remote. I guess I got spoiled but I imagined most updated TVs have the remote capabilities of not having to be a few feet away and directly pointing at the tv in order to use it. This tv-Randomly freezes all togetherRestarts randomlyDoesn’t always respondDisconnects from WiFi randomlyApps mess up on a regular basisExample, Hulu opens and says there is no internet connection while I’m on my iPad playing a game that requires internet... if I switch apps like go into Netflix once I get the no connection message, Netflix will work. you will have to exit to the main menu a few times before it decides there actually IS a connection and goes to the movie menu. And yes, I have tested my connection during these times. It was fine. I’ve never had an issue with these apps till I switched to this tv.Altogether, it’s an okay tv but I wouldn’t recommend it to people just because of the sheer irritation I experience on a regular basis. Roku is the worst.Update; I regret this purchase. I feel I would have gotten better use of my money with a normal tv without smart capabilities than having bought this television. I would rather use my fire than deal with the trouble that is Roku and this tv. Horrible pairing. Good if you’re strapped and don’t really do anything but need a tv.

  When I originally got the tv it was great. The quality of the picture, the volume, etc. was great.The remote stopped working after a few months. Literally just stopped working no matter what I did. Changed the batteries multiple times to no avail. I looked up the issue and basically it said “just buy a new remote.” I ended up downloading the remote app which works but is obnoxious because you need to be connected to WiFi on your phone and it can be slow to load sometimes.More recently, the volume just keeps going out. For no reason at all. I can hear the volume of the buttons I’m pressing. But when I go into Hulu or Netflix, hbo, Disney, etc. the volume of the show is just gone. It’s incredibly aggravating. Also, it sometimes takes two tries for my tv to turn on. I will press the power button and then it will take forever to load. And then when I’m in an app and about to watch a show, the TV just powers down and restarts. Almost every time I turn on the tv.I have two of these, one for my living room and one for my bedroom. I got them because they were reasonably priced for the size. And I would highly recommend you pay extra for a different brand. It’s not worth the money you’re saving.

  During the couple of weeks I have had this tv I have had a blast. It's smart features are amazing, the user interface is simple and easy to navigate, and the picture quality is great considering the price. However, there are two things that bug me about the tv, two things that should be an easy fix in newer models: the remote and backlight bleed. The remote is good in and of itself. However, you have to point it directly at the sensor on the tv for it to receive inputs, and even then it's spotty. Thankfully there is the Roku app that functions as a flawless remote. The second issue is backlight bleed around the edges of the screen. The edges of the screen are clearly brighter than the rest of the screen. It's a small issue, but it is a bit of an annoyance. I'd doesn't, however, diminish from my viewing experience much at all. Overall, this is a great tv for the price, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a smart TV on a budget.

  LOVE LOVE LOVE this TV! I remember reading some bad reviews before I purchased but there were so many more good reviews I decided to get it. I'm so glad I bought this tv... I'm still finding out new things about it lol.I initially only bought it to be able to watch Netflix and Prime,  etc; without extra devices and cords (new toddler in the house). For weeks that's all I watched... then I realized I actually have live tv!! 😯🎉🥳🎊For those who are fed up with those ridiculously high cable providers, this is the way to go! 👏🏽👌🏽I had no problems with setup, no problems connecting. I was worried that the stands wouldn't actually hold up the TV, I thought it would be wobbly. But nope even when the kids are playing tag and bump into the dresser, that tv doesn't budge.The batteries that came in the box died sooner than I'd like but that's common with any batteries that come with your purchase.The smart features are awesome. The picture quality is very vivid and the colors are great.I do wish there was a way to set the sleep timer while  watching shows - it can only be set from the home screen. Also the screen saver that I selected seems to only stay on for maybe 2 minutes then it somehow goes to the default manufacturer screen saver which is just not as pretty as the one I picked 😜.As with all things, I'm sure there have been some not so great experiences but I have had nothing but I love my Roku TV.

    Great TV but not for a bedroom! Read why
  
",4.0 ,Joshua H. Hensley,"Reviewed in the United States November 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  Great TV however I put this in the bedroom and if you like sleeping in a dark room there is a pretty serious LED light at the bottom of the TV that constantly stays on. It is so severe and bright that I had to put some masking tape across it. That helped but it's also the sensor for the remote so that made at work a little slower. I would buy this TV again but if I had known that light would be there I wouldn't have chosen this one for the bedroom!

    Bad for a Bedroom
  
",2.0 ,shawn  & edna brewster,"Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought this tv for a bedroom. The lighting adjustment is a selection of preset modes. The lowest light setting is too bright for a bedroom, in my opinion. I could play a game of cards in my room with just this tv for light, with minor difficulty. The sound fluctuates horribly. If you have the sound high enough to hear normal talking, it will blast you during everything else. This tv would probably be ok for a living room and would be better if you bought a sound bar. However, I would not recommend it for a bedroom.

  I use two of these in a game room and couldn't be more satisfied. Except I can. The issue is there remote, one will control both TVs. To fix this I had to invest it two WiFi remotes, each had to be set to control a specific television.These work great as monitors as well. I mounted them on the Amazon brand swing arm mounts so they have a wide range of adjustability.The colors are good, for the price. The TV has one button to control all the functions based on how long you hold or quickly press it. All in all its a good buy.

  I'll start off with saying I have two 55"" TCL Roku tv's I bought locally, which are super awesome! So, when I needed a replacement for a 40"", I wanted to replace it with the same brand. Luckily, I bought it cheaper on Black Friday on Amazon. I was worried that it would come smashed up, and when the box looked beat up, I was prepared for the worst. The tv was packaged great and was fine despite the damaged box. Picture is great as well. I don't use the ""smart"" functions as I have an xbox one hooked up to it. So, don't pay high prices for a ""name"" brand, TCL is just as good if not better for reasonable prices.

    Annoying Roku setup

  If you add this TV to your wireless network on the initial setup, it will try to get you to sign up for ROKU. Really annoying feature that you cannot get past.If you do make that mistake - on the back of the TV right above the HDMI inputs is a small reset button. Press and hold that to rest your TV to factory defaults. Then skip adding your TV to your wireless network.Apart from the Roku ""feature"" the TV itself has solid picture and surprisingly good built in sound.  It's worth the price for sure.

  I bought this tv specifically because I was looking for a Roku model that was inexpensive. This fits the bill. Picture is very good for the price. Roku works great. The remote is intuitive but I rarely use it, prefering instead to use the Roke app (which is great because it lets me send sound directly to my phone/earbuds and not bother anyone else late at night.)The first one of this same exact model I got had a blue line down the middle. That one went back. Second one is fine.I knocked it a star because it lacks a volume regulator. Commercials get very loud and there's no built-in setting to get a more consistent volume level. This is actually a bit annoying when you're wanting the tv for background noise and - suddenly - you're blasted with a noisy commercial.Set has plenty of ports - could use a longer power cord imho - but is very light.

  We have antennae TV.  From the instructions, The only way to change channels is one at a time up or down the available channels.  For example, when we want to change from ABC to NBC, we must page through 16 channels to get there.  A real pain!  Upon contact with them, I was told a universal remote will not help.  BUT, I just discovered (no instructions on this) that if you hit the left arrow, all available stations come up along with what is playing now and ahead.  Now you can, using the arrows select what you want to watch on any channel, hit the OK and it goes there.  I'm still looking for how to go to last channel viewed.I'm sure it is there someplace.

  This remote can make even Santa Claus lose it.  As the other reviewers state, it takes several button pushes while moving the remote around to get it to work.  I've tried sitting right in front of the TV, back a little bit, up high, down low, in the middle, at an angle, etc. and it just plan sucks.I keep accidentally muting the TV or changing the volume because the buttons are in a weird position on the side.  Since it doesn't have numbers and you have to navigate to do anything, it's especially frustrating that the signal to the TV is so bad.  My internet connection is excellent so it's not that.  I tried putting in new batteries.  It's not that.  My frustration level is why I'm giving it a 3.I don't have a cable or satellite provider.  I mostly use Amazon prime, which isn't a button on the remote.  Can someone recommend a good universal remote that works with this TV?  The Samsung remote to my DVD player doesn't work.

  These TCL TV have processor issues.  In setup mode or any mode where wifi is not active, the tv operates properly by instruction from the remote.  As soon as you use any feature that requires wifi, say Roku, the remote stops working.  I have spent several days troubleshooting this myself because TCL customer service is useless and dismissive.  The problem is that the tv depends on the Roku interface to control basic tv functions which depends on input from the remote.  So, since the tv won't process the wifi signal and the remote signal at the same time, nothing works.  It's that simple.  If you buy one and you think your remote is bad don't waste time being sent a replacement remote.  It's not the remote, it's the processor.  This is why some people say their phone works better than the remote, because the phone is controlling the interface thru wifi.  Now, that isn't necessarily a fix, because the tv has horrible wifi performance.  Our old Wii has better performance.  While I wanted to like this tv because it has a decent picture, the faults strongly outweigh the positives.  It's cheaper for a reason and it's not worth the trouble.

  I am with the physical tv hardware, it's a good screen and size for a low price.But the Roku software is a massive pain and crashes all the time. It normally takes at least two attempts to start a show on Netflix, with Netflix often crashing and returning to the TV's home screen on the first attempt. It's especially bad on Netflix but it also happens in other apps such as Hulu.The tv also often doesn't respond to the remote as you press it, and then it suddenly catches up and implements all the commands (often leading to it crashing). This can happen with volume and muting or any command.

",2.0 ,Clyde,"Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  If you WANT first and foremost a SMART TV, then this is a good choice.  But we buy these for guest rooms at a motel, and starting up in SMART TV mode is very confusing to guests.  Older models had an option (so I'm told) to start up in HDMI input mode.  Instead, it always starts up in ROKU mode, and then you have to select HDMI1 input.  But that's only after you've gone through the process to sign up as a guest in guest mode.  Unfortunately, the plain non smart TCL tv's cost considerably more.  Sounds like ROKU is subsidizing these.Just reduced this another star... even though we set it to ""home"" mode, there was still another menu item to go find that turns off an advertising window that superimposed over the screen every 90 seconds.So, two fixes suggested to TCL & ROKU (don't know who calls the shots on this).  1. Allow power-on to a default input and bypass ROKU menu (but of course, still let viewers go to Roku menu).  2. Ship with all store settings off.  Let a store turn those on...

  I bought this TV in Dec. 2018... I started using it in Jan. 2019. After a few months of using this TV (NOT DAILY) I noticed that the remote started giving trouble. It wasn't navigating as easily but I didn't really stress over it because I wasn't using the TV often. After a while it became unbearable and I realized there was some sort of fluid coming from the back. The TCL batteries that came with the remote had basically exploded inside of the remote and damaged it to the point where it stopped working. I cannot use the TV without the remote because there is one single button on this TV. ONE. And it doesn't have a clear function.I know someone who bought the 4k TV and it stopped working after about 9 months. We live in the Caribbean so even if it was not long passed the point of return, we still wouldn't be able to return these this. I thought TCL was a worthy brand but TCL has put that thought to rest for me. I won't be buying anything that's TCL branded again.

  I did not intend to write a review but have changed my mind. I like the tv, and it meets my needs, which is background noise. Honestly, support, despite their touting it to the contrary, is nonexistent. When I tried online support, it was clear the agent was working with more than just me; responses took upwords of a minute. I finally gave up and asked for email support. The only emails I got warned me that (despite my response) if I did not respond in 3, then 5, days, they would close the issue. The issue was never addressed, or even mentioned. When I told them that I solved the issue despite their lack of support, the response was ""If you do not respond in 3 days we will close the issue."" I begged them to close the issue and stop sending me emails. It did not help. When I emailed for support from crackle, I got the same useless support; in fact, it appeared to be the same group doing the support. When I figured out that programs were constantly loading because of the way commercials are addressed (they are not integrated like they were when I was a lot younger; instead, they start up randomly, typically in the middle of a sentence), I thought my issue was over. However the ROKU channel still complains frequently that my wireless connection is not fast enough. I have checked it numerous times, including immediately after a ROKU complaint. ROKU recommends 3Mpbs download speed; I have a minimum of 9Mpbs and frequently over 10Mpbs. My provider guarantees 8Mpbs. I am a widower with no one using my wireless connection but me. This problem occurs exclusively on the ROKU channel. What does happen on every channel is, consistently when I first turn on the tv, I am told the wireless connection cannot be found; however, when I restart, the connection miraculously appears. Finally, I thought it was illegal to up the audio gain for commercials. I can have the sound turned down to the point that I can barely hear it during the program and be blasted out of the house when the commercials come on. I rated the tv overall a 3; it probably deserves a 5. ROKU deserves a 1 for service and technology. Overall the average is a 3.

  The reason I purchased this television was to be able to pair with my Echo Show.  The directions they provide were incorrect or not necessarily written for this particular model.  After contacting customer service, they provided additional options / directions to connect.  These directions were helpful, but still not very workable.  After playing with this adjustment and that adjustment, using the Roku App and the Alexa App, I was finally able to pair after a few days.  Now the problem is when I ask Alexa to do something with Amazon Prime Video, she may do it on my Echo Show or may do it on the television.  Alexa has a problem differentiating between the two.  Overall I find this a huge problem.  What this television needs is a remote with a voice option.  I would be perfectly happy having that option, but as with many inexpensive smart televisions, the remote is very simple, too simple.  Also the volume control on the remote is located on its side, which is rather odd to use.The Roku App does work well as a remote. Everything is there for ease of use, but I do not want to have to use my phone as a remote.I am still considering sending this television back to Amazon due to incorrect or misleading information on the listing, but will continue to work with Alexa to see if the pairing works better.  Overall, I would not recommend this television.

  Watch!  There is something run with mine.  Since new, the screen goes black after 20/30 minutes on.  Power remains on, and I hear sound, but you see no picture.  I purchased the Amazon warranty but is so complicated to ship a TV that size that I'm still using it with the problem.

    Spare room TV

  TCL does a decent job at providing a basic smart TV with full ROKU functionality.  However, if you're looking for great picture quality, this series is not for you.  The black levels leave much to be desired.  This particular TCL  also fails at handling motion properly.  It experiences ghosting any time there is fast motion.If you're needing a spare room TV though, and not requiring good picture quality, then you've found the right TV.

    Wins award for worst remote control ever foisted onto unwitting consumers

  Remote is problematic. This is my first Roku tv though I have had many generations of Rokus. I would of returned this if I had the ability to do so based on the remote. It has to be directed precisely at the right spot, is slow to respond and doesn't even feel good in your hand. A major disappointment. I don't want to use my phone as a remote. Give me a decent remote, I'm willing to pay a little more. I wanted a Lexus and got a Kia.

  I bought this for my bedroom, to replace an older TV. I wanted the built-in Roku because I have a Roku in the living room and this way they would synchronize and I could watch the same apps at either location. Setting up this TV was a breeze and the options are great. It was nice that this TV was on sale when I purchased it.

  We bought this tv for our treadmill and Bowflex room downstairs and are very happy with it, very good but not great picture, solid sound, and super easy to connect to our WiFi for streaming. The remote works perfectly for streaming but if you watch a lot of over air or cable/sat it can be annoying not having number buttons.All in all this is a really darn good tv for the money and you would be hard pressed to find better in its cost range.

  We bought this tv for our older mother. The remote is confusing with the mute and volume buttons on the side. It’s easy to mute the tv accidentally when picking up the remote. There’s no way to go directly to cable tv without going through an initial menu which is very confusing to older users. The feet do not install easily unless you have a power driver. I would not recommend this model for older users.  Spend more money and get a brand name.

    Nice TV, Terrible Remote, Glitchy
  
",3.0 ,rockwren,"Reviewed in the United States August 18, 2019","









  
  
    
  The good:The TV has a nice picture, the set up is easy to follow and intuitive.The annoying:We have two of these tvs, and the remotes are TERRIBLE. You have to hit each button 2-5 times to get it to work, and then of course you hit it an extra time and it selects the wrong thing. We plan to find a universal remote to improve the situation, but it's irritating that the remote doesn't perform its most basic function. Shouldn't be that complicated.The really annoying:The Amazon app is really glitchy. Prime regularly refuses to play videos we've bought or things included on PBS kids. They play just fine on our Kindles and my husband's computer, so this is a TV issue.

  I am really starting to wonder if the reviews on Amazon are from fake customers that buy units and create reviews, because this is the second Chinese made product that I bought of Amazon with glaring reviews that was a piece of junk.  This TV started out great and had a good picture and seemed easy to use.  I will say when unboxing it did feel really cheap.  It is super thin and it almost feels like it won’t stand under its own weight with the flimsy feet they give you for it.  The protective tape they put on the sides nearly felt like it would crack the screen when removing.  We were pleasantly surprised with the picture and then the issues began after a couple weeks.  The TV started turning off and back on all by itself.  After doing some research this is an all too common TCL issue.  Well I wasn’t told about this by my wife and kids until too late and I can’t return it to Amazon.  We are at day 45 now...  So now I have to mess around with TCL (the fly by night TV company) that has 30 minute wait times to get a hold of customer service.  I wish I would have just went to an actual Best Buy store and actually viewed the TV and spoke to someone that sees and hears about these every day..

   Positive: price was great, picture quality is great, easy to mount, or stand on the legs it comes with.Negative: I literally have to re-login to my Internet EVERY time I turn it on (video attached)Plus Hulu does the same with logging me out, really annoying and time consuming to manually enter login info with a remote, every time I want to watch something 😫I got a Panasonic TV for my living room, just a world of difference in ease of use. I will NEVER buy a Roku TV again, it’s really awful compared to the amazing one in my living room.

  I bought this for our back patio. It's covered, but in South Texas you get a lot of humidity and dust and whatnot. The TV that was there made it a few years and died, so it was time to replace it. Inside my house I generally buy the pricier Samsungs or Sonys, but this really is a good TV. And for the money, I'd say it is great. I am not connecting anything to it, so I wanted something with all of the media apps we use (Netflix, Disney, YouTube TV, etc). This had all of those and more so I only need one simple remote and we can watch everything from the comfort of our patio.

  Love these TCL TVs! When you’re paying less than $200 for a 40” TV, it’s really hard to find anything to complain about.  I had also purchased a little 32” last year for our cabin and thought it was perfectly fine given the price point - so I decided to buy a 40” for our home bedroom to replace an ancient “name brand” from years ago.  Highly recommend these TCLs as an affordable option.

  I bought 2 of these (the other a slightly smaller model for daughters' room).We had no problems with either of them.Not with damage or the set up. All you need is a Roku account. Simple.

Getting the wall mount and soundbar installed was more difficult....relatively speaking...this tv was pretty lightweight.I'm sure there far superior TVs out there but if you're looking to save some money but still have a great picture then look no further.I'll update if it suddenly craps out but I'm hopeful  ;)

  I really like this TV. The software is great and snappy. Huge app selection. You can't get a better TV for this price. However, there are a few things to be aware of. Like many Smart TVs today this TV doesn't support Apple AirPlay. Another thing, the remote HAS to be pointed directly at the TV. There cannot be ANY obstacles in the way otherwise the TV won't pick up the signal. It wouldn't even receive the signal through my brand new MacBook screen. The speakers are incredible. They are room-filling and they sound amazing. You don't need an external speaker set up. They also get very loud. One more thing, when connecting my MacBook Pro via HDMI it does look a little grainy. I'm not sure if that's my cable or my adapter but just something to beware of. The picture quality is fine for the price and this is one of the few TVs I've seen that actually has brightness settings. Settings > TV picture settings > TV brightness. Back to the picture quality though, it's 1080p and fine at normal viewing distance but if you want this on your desk and to use as a second monitor it starts to look fairly pixelated the closer you get. Overall, I would recommend this TV and it should last years to come.

  I wish I had gotten a bigger model because I love the picture and profile of this TV. The options available with Roku exceed my expectations and I was able to connect all my streaming accounts easily. The down side is the remote and the sensor. You have to point the remote directly at the sensor to register anything. The close proximity of the volume and mute means I often mute when I'm trying to change the volume. The last pet peeve is the power light is on all the time! That means I got an unwelcome night light. Otherwise I am very pleased with my TV and have recommended this item to several people as it was recommended to me.

  I bought this t.v the first week in March and it's already done. Unfortunately, the legs are not sturdy enough, and my cat brushed up against it and knocked it to the floor.

Other than that the picture quality was pretty good.. but definitely not durable enough alone on its stand. For next time I know to immediately mount it up to keep this from happening again. I really think it should have a middle stand rather than 2 thin side stands.

  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we wanted a portable TV that we can use outside in our backyard.  A friend told me about these Roku TVs so I found this one.  It is not too big nor too small and perfect for my use.  It was fairly easy to set up and the wifi connection is excellent.  I have it very close to my router so I don't have any signal issues but works flawlessly.The picture quality is not the best, definitely not even close to my Pioneer Kuro plasma but it is decent.  The contrast and brightness is not the best but is just an okay TV to entertain people outside on the patio.What I LOVE the most is that I don't need any cable connections whatsoever.  No network cable and none of that nonsense.  I just connect it to a power outlet and that's it.  That's pure magic!I think the most disappointing part of all this is the remote control.  It is a really cheap remote so please try not to drop it.  I will try to get some kind of cover or something to protect it because it is really really plasticky and the buttons feel really cheap and fragile.

  UPDATE: TV just broke. Had it for 7 months. I saw questions where some people have asked about warranty. Manufacture chimed in saying there is a one year warranty and provided e-mail address. Other reviews and question answers say over and over and over that there is no warranty, Company did not respond about warranty. Company denied there is a warranty. I am so upset. Bought this to replace my identical TV that broke after 3 years. It was poor judgment on my part to buy it again. Lesson learned. NEVER AGAIN!!! STAY AWAY!It took me a while to determine how I felt about this TV, but after using it I regret the purchase. To begin, I bought this TV when my older model of the same TV died after 3 years. Maybe I'm crazy but I expect more than 3 years out of a TV. My bad. Even crazier I bought the recent version of the same TV. That was stupid, but I was in a hurry. I imagine I may get 3 years out of this one if I continue to use it. The connections have changed. I thought since my surround sound worked with the last one it would work with this one. Nope. I can't correct surround sound using the AV adapter supplied. Does not work. Picture is so, so. Sound - well if I could get my surround sound hooked but it may be better. In the end I wish I had researched more and bought a better TV. I am beyond the return window on this. Doesn't work for me. I am replacing it with w different brand , better TV.

I have to be somewhat close to the tv for it to work, and it needs to be pointed at the perfect angle. Not a problem since my couch is close, but something to keep in mind.

  A very fine 40“ 1080 p TV for a small price. I have owed this TV for about a week and have been pleased with the picture for movies, sports and network TV. If you a looking for a basic TV with a great picture this is it. Moreover I can control the on and off, volume and channels all through the Alex app. And Roku is seemlessly built in. If your a cord cutter like I am this a great upgrade. Roku TV alone gives you at least 50 channels and good free movies. Now add the Roku app to your phone and you never need to find you remote again. The Roku on thid TV is probably one of the best features. Delivered to my door in four days with out any issues. Thanks Amazon and UPS. My only negative comment is that getting this TV to work with Alexa is going to require patience. It is good AI after you figure it out but it is not intuitive. In short Alexa will control this device but Roku wants an honorable mentionwhen you say the command: ""Alexa, channel 3.1 on Living Room TV."" Alexa will respond. ""Tuning to 3.1 on Roku"". So understand you are controling the TV but it wants to tell you you are using the Roku software. This is really no different from any other device but my smart plugs don't annouce ""turning on your lamp through Kaza"". BTW Kaza is a brand of smart plug. (best plug in my opinion-pun intened)So I share all of this as it is really cool when it works. When controlling the TV fuctions such as on and off and volume the TV says nothing about Roku. But tell it to go to Channel 27 it wants credit but keep in mind your talking to Alexa and she has apprently agreed to allow her smart friend Roku to take some credit for some of her smart AI functions.

    Amazing tv. But chinsey legs, one was broken.
  
",3.0 ,Lauren L,"Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  This would be 5 stars across the board except for one very very important fact. It came with a broken leg. I'm so thankful for a handy boyfriend, but it is still just a temporary fix, and now I have to spend time and money searching online to see if I can find a new leg.The legs. Or feet. Whatever you want to fall them are made out of incredibly cheap and brittle plastic. One was cracked clean through out of the box.Other than that... Picture quality is outstanding. Sound is also excelent.I love the mute button on my remote (my old Roku didn't have that)It works really well as a second monitor. I'm on bed rest recovering from a back injury so I've been using it as a monitor so I can stay entertained with games while in bed.I haven't played anything like league of legends on it, but borderlands 3 works just fine. Diablo as well. No missing frames than I can notice.Only con is the cheap legs and that mine came broken.

  Have had this 7 months now, and am happy with it Bought it for bedroom, and fits perfectly atop my dresser. Picture and sound are great, and has been easy to use. Was able to get it out of box and set on top of dresser by myself; it's pretty light weight. Only gripe is that it's difficult to figure out how to turn off if you misplace the remote. Setting the sleep timer and having same brand in living room w/compatible remote has solved that though :)

  I love my new TV!  Quite a change from my 12 year old 19”. I found it easy to set up ( no scammers for me) and was surprised by how light and easy to maneuver it was. (I don’t have it mounted, just used the enclosed “legs”.). There are only two things that are less than perfect for me. On the remote the sound level/ mute button is on the side and I often manage to turn off the tv or change channels while reaching for the volume button — not a big deal, I just need to be less clumsy. The other is that the Roku does not have (at least, I haven’t found) the function of reducing the resolution to less than HD. Since I am in a rural area with horribly slow internet, this is a drawback. My solution is to run streaming through my kindle fire where I can reduce resolution, then screen mirror to the TV. It took a while to find the screen mirroring function, but it is there!  And truthfully, it looks just as good as HD and doesn’t buffer so much. I have been able to find an answer to any question by googling the name of the TV and whatever I want to do.  I really like this TV.

  I was a little hesitant to make this purchase because I'm not familiar with the TCL brand..actually never heard of them until seeing the TV showcased here on Amazon. but I figured, ""it seems to have a lot of authentic positive reviews...why not give it a try?"" So glad I did; easily one of the best purchases I've made in a long time! The screen is bright, crisp, and clear, the interface is really cool and user friendly, and I've had NO problems or issues with it at all (as of this writing I've had it for almost 6 months now). Just a great TV all around.

  Update: This is the first smart TV I have purchased and in my original review I stated I was unhappy with this TV because the picture was reduced in size on certain channels.  I called  TCL customer support to tell them about the picture being small on some channels and they said it had to do with. Y cable box settings. I called my cable company, and they had me change some settings with my cable remote control and now all is well! By the way, TCL customer service is great.The picture quality is great and the TV is easy to set up and user friendly, but on some channels the size of the picture is very small, yet on many channels the picture covers the entire screen. I use a cable company for my service. I have trouble shooted on my own to resolve it, but have had no luck. Very strange. When I have time I'll call customer service and hopefully be able to resolve it...and hopefully change this review for the better.

    ROKU IS FREE, this is a decent 40' Smart TV
  
",4.0 ,Mary D,"Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2021","









  
  
    
  First and foremost, Roku is free. It is pre-installed on this Smart TV. If you have a Roku account, you follow the on screen steps to log-in using the email address you previously had registered with. If you are a new Roku customer, you indicate that, and still follow the on screen instructions. A real Roku account will NOT cost money, and there is not a number to call. Now, if you want something more than what Roku offers for free, you pick a streaming provider, there are many. Sling, Hulu, Fubo, YouTube TV, to name a few. Those services are not free. I subscribe to Sling and have the past year. This TV has the app for Netflix, also not a free service, Disney+, again, not a free service. All these streaming services cost money. If you have Amazon Prime, you get Amazon Video free, unless you're renting/buying a movie. These are all apps you download.So, for anyone saying this TV is a scam, I hope this review clears it up. Don't give the TV a bad wrap because you don't understand the technology.Now, onto the TV. It was easy peasy to set up. I screwed in the little legs on the bottom, and plugged it in. No extra cords since Roku is built in. I don't use a sound bar or a DVD player, and my son's video game stuff is in his room. For the cheap price, this TV has a good picture and decent sound. Overall, I am really pleased.

  I read a couple of reviews on how the TV tends to crash and disconnect sometimes.I bought this TV back in December 2020 and installed it late January. The set up is extremely easy. The picture quality is excellent and the sound is great.It was working perfectly fine until the end of February I noticed a big delay. The TV lags a lot.The apps is constantly crashing. Sometimes I play a movie from any platform and the sound doesn’t work at all.Many times I had to power on and off or unplug it.I read the warnings and decided to take a chance hoping it wouldn’t happen to me, but it did!Definitely not worth buying this brand of TV. I had an LG Smart TV and it started to lag after six years of owning it.

  My TV came with an utterly destroyed screen. I was able to return it and get my money back, but basically wrecking my room and set it up only to find that it got ruined at some point during delivery, and then rushing to Meijer to get one that actually works so that I didn't have to spend the next several days with no TV, and theeeeeeen hooking that one up after repackagaing the broken one- all after a long work day- was extremely frustrating.

",3.0 ,Wiste,"Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purchased this TV mostly for console gaming and watching YouTube in bed. The picture quality is completely fine, sharp and bright. However, the Smart TV features leave something to be desired. It has a good arrangement of apps to choose from, and the ability to change the background is a nice touch. However, the lack of an internet browser is what keeps this from truly turning into a multimedia hub for me.The remote is a piece of trash. If I push the buttons, there's a 1 in 5 chance that it will register. Otherwise, the screen does nothing. There is a Roku app you can get that let's you control the TV through your phone, which is incredibly more responsive. However, that app is also buggy, as it cannot connect unless the TV is on (though it can shut off the TV when connected), meaning that you must use the remote or manually turn on the TV regardless. Also, the app randomly disconnects from the TV whenever my phone goes to sleep, but that has nothing to do with this product.All in all, if you simply want a simple TV for gaming, this is a solid pick. As a multimedia device, it leaves a lot to be desired.

  The TV has poor audio quality that wavers between working, and metallic. We had to make 6 phone calls just to finally place an order to exchange it. The picture is fine and the WiFi is fine. But if you need audio on your TV, pick a different one.We haven't had any updates since then and we now believe that this TV may be the one we're stuck with. So the TV and the warranty are not a good value and the customer service is not a good value either.

  Ordered this TV, was super excited because it was a good deal, waited over a week for it, finally received it. Took it out of the box, put the feet on (which wasn't easy!) got it all set up with the wires and placed it right where i wanted it. Went to go turn it on and it didn't do anything. I thought I was crazy, so I double checked everything, faceted my brother-in-law who's an electrician, he helped me do exactly what I had did correct and once again... nothing! I called the number TCL offers on the instructions and well let me tell you... that was a waste of my time! They said I could return it back with Amazon or send them a video of the set up and me physically not being able to turn the tv on, since its under warranty. They said that once they get the video of the TV not working they will email me a return label so I can SEND THEM BACK THE TV to see whats wrong with it, and the whole process by the time I would get a new TV would be about 2 weeks... SERIOUSLY?! Guess stye don't believe in customers always right, and just send a new TV out. UGHHHH IM SO ANNOYED !!!!!

  Got the TV sooner than the original shipping estimate - goodNothing was damaged - goodPlugged it in, went though the set up (Roku only, no other devices will be used on this TV) - in the final step where you have to logon to the Roku site to register the code that is showing on the screen, received Error Code 003 - BADI called the number indicated on website, spoke to a support person - very difficult to understand what she was saying (heavy accent and a very noisy background).... After re-setting my router and confirming that my existing Roku was still working properly, I decided to hang up with the support person - she was telling me that my network was ""infected"" and I needed a tech support person to come to my house... This was after refusing to allow her to take over my computer - oh, and she did ask me for my Roku account password - which I didn't giver her... Overall support experience was brutal...Error Code 003 - seems to be a problem that this Roku device had with the Network Security protocol that is in use at my home... Standard Xfinity - whatever the default is... (AES?).... So I set up my iPhone as a hot spot, reset the Roku TV to factory and started over... The connection through my iPhone went without a hitch (I already had a Roku account so I just clicked through the sales crap), once set up, the Roku device was able to receive and install updates - which apparently fixed the issue with Network Security protocol - and I switched over to my home WIFI without any further problems...  TV works great - I use the Xfinity App primarily.  I use this TV outside so I only need a power cord and no other cables... very clean set up...  Well worth the money - as long as you don't get trapped by the support issue... Roku should really improve that situation right away!

  Great tv if you don't want a remote that works. The remote stopped working pretty quick. I replaced with a universal that worked for a bit. There's something wrong internally that makes ot not pick up remote signals.

So it's basically useless unless you have the volume where you want it.

  I had just recently become in need of a new TV, after 5 or 6 plus years with a more well named brand TV.  That older model decided to just not work out of nowhere.  I wanted to replace it with something in a comparable size, and after searching and researching reviews, I decided on this model.I was extremely skeptical at first, as I had never heard of the brand, and the price seemed way too good to be true.  But it was worth the gamble.This came very quickly and was easy to set up.  You need a Philips Head screwdriver to install the two legs, and after that, you simply need to just plug it in, and hook up your cable box.This has 3 HDMI slots and and USB port should they be needed.  I was in need of on HDMI for my cable, one for my laptop, and one for my fire stick.  As this TV comes equipped with ROKU, my Fire stick  is really not a priority.The ROKU channels are great and easy to set up.  You can add and delete channels with ease.  The remote even has 4 shortcut buttons for the more popular channels including Netflix, Hulu, Roku channel, and Disney plus.  That is a very nice option to have.I wish this TV had a Bluetooth headphone option.  It does not, so please be aware of that, should that be a priority.Overall I am very please with this TV, and beyond thankful there was an affordable option out there that was perfect for my needs!

  Two issues.  It loses wifi connection and then either can't find any networks or won't connect.  It also has no bluetooth capability.I have the latest software version and there are no other devices on my network that lose their connection. Sometimes resetting the TV on its own will re-acquire connection, however I often have to reset both the TV AND the router to allow for re-connection.  This only lasts until the TV is turned off, and back on, when connection is lost again. Factory reset of TV did not resolve either.Online research reveals that this is a common, known  problem with TCL televisions.  I'm considering giving the set away and buying another brand.

  I got this TV as a replacement for the one in my bedroom and am very grateful the manufacturer made the 40"" size as I'm using it in an armoire . It *just* fits!I really like the smart aspect of this TV. It's run on the Roku line of products so it's quite easy to set up and operate.I wish the remote was just a bit bigger or at least had the wrist lanyard like my old Roku one had for gaming. Due to its small size, there are few buttons available, however, you can download the remote app for more in depth functionality. I worry it's small size is going to mean it gets lost easily.I'm not as fond of the fact that there's a menu screen you have to go through to get to the satellite input option. With my old TV it just started with the last input option used and didn't change until you told it to. I'll get used to it but it means always juggling two remotes every time I turn it on.The picture quality is far and away better than my old unit but the sound has a tinny quality I'm not loving.Setup was easy and the TV is very lightweight: My back appreciated that!I'm taking off a star for the sound and the remote.

  I was very happy with my purchase for about 6 months. The remote was the only thing I has some issues with because it would fail at times. Nothing major or at least I thought.After about 7 months the TV started showing signs of severe lag and would crash apps without warning. Simple actions like raising or lowering the volume would take about 6-8 seconds to kick in and those are the times when the command actually worked. Also the TV started taking a very long time (a few minutes) to connect to the wifi. On many occasions I had to unplug the tv from the wall in order to fully reset. This seemed to help.I considered sending the tv back since I was still within the warranty period but didn’t really want to go through all that trouble. So I decided to call customer service and get help directly from the source instead. Bad call on my part, should have sent it back.Gotta say their customer service is ok, not great. I’ve had many calls with them at this point and everything they make me do seems to be very short term fixes that solve the lag problem and constantly crashing apps for a few days at best. The last call I had with CS was actually today when they had me reset to factory settings my TV and after going through all that trouble, the TV started acting up again after only a few hours. Didn’t even last a full afternoon.At this point, I have a TV that only raises and lowers volume when it wants, crashes apps like Netflix, YouTube and Apple TV constantly, and the UI in general lags for so long that I find myself turning the TV off and streaming on my laptop.Sadly, it’s too late to return since I’m past the 1 year mark. I understand it could have been simple bad luck and that my TV is faulty but I regret buying this product. After my experience, I highly doubt I would buy this brand again.Additional info: picture quality was always good and sound always worked well. Sound quality seems to be good when watching movies or playing music. One quite annoying thing I did notice from the beginning is the lightbulb when it’s powered off. The light is quite bright and big. I’m not a person that usually get bothered by light or sound when sleeping and this was very noticeably bright. The remote feels cheap and poorly made compared to other Roku TVs and devices I have in my house.

  I finally decided to get a Roku TV for my bedroom, and after reading many reviews, decided on the TCL. Glad I did because it was an excellent purchase decision. Nice picture, great choices of programming, and especially during the pandemic stay at home order, I have not run out of things to watch.  The remote loudness and mute controls are on the right side area of the remote, which is awkward if you are right handed. No big deal, but seems like an odd place to locate those controls on the remote. In spite of this, the TCL is great and I want to purchase one for the family room now. So, yes ...

  The easiest setup ever. Best thought out software. I am not mechanical, either.Excellent company, as far as I can tell. Although based in China, when I stopped getting sound after a couple of weeks and called the company, i got a real person who immediately told me to unplug the TV and thereby to reboot it. That worked. But to get someone on the phone quickly these days is not usual.The picture is not as good as on some TVs, but my other is a top of the line SONY for close to ten times the money. Whadd'ya want, egg in your beer?

  We are very happy with this TV. The price was reasonable and the picture quality is amazing for the price. The channel changer is GREAT, especially for my husband who hates complicated changers and is not tech savvy. This has simple, easy to use buttons. We bought this TV as we wanted to switch over to an antenna and dump cable. The TV, once we hooked up the antenna, gives us a channel listing just like a cable TV does.  Very cool!  Plus, it has all the streaming video options that we wanted. Highly recommend this TV.

  This TV has a great picture for it's size. It is the smallest TV I found that support 1080p so I could use it as a computer monitor as well as a bedroom TV. The roku features are excellent and the TV antenna does a great job of supporting over the air broadcasts. I bought another one for my son and he uses it for xbox gaming and is happy with the refresh rate and picture quality as well. I didn't think I would use the roku features often, but I use pandora for a radio much more than I thought I would as well as netflix and amazon prime for movies.

  I am extremely disappointed with this Roku TV  I have no control over the visual image, and I am talking slow motion and freeze frame. If I had known that was not available I would NOT HAVE PURCHASED this machine.From what I can find online, the slow motion option is simply not available on this machine. It appears to me to be a remote issue. This ""super simple"" remote is too damn simple. I want more control.The picture is fine. The sound is okay. Set up was fairly simple. But by removing this option the whole fun of having this machine is gone.Boo. If this cannot be repaired I will never purchase another Roku and will never recommend this to anyone.

  This TV is outstanding. I own 5 of these and am very impressed with the picture quality and overall ease of use. I own fire sticks, roku sticks and even an older chromecast, and the Roku Smart TV is far easier to use than any 2 remote control configuration like you have with the add on roku's or fire sticks. The remote has only a few simple buttons and the main menu you see when you turn on the TV is super intuitive and very easily customizable.I hate having 2 remotes or having to explain to a guest how to work the remote for my TV. With this TV the user interface is terrific , the picture quality is fantastic and even the sound is better than I expected for this price point. I previously purchased Vizio's but the interface on those was far more limited and they were returned. I don't do reviews often but these TV's are worth the time and definitely get 5 Stars from me.

    TCL's Quality Plunge
  
",1.0 ,OH Lasha,"Reviewed in the United States March 14, 2021","









  
  
    
  I've purchased a few TCL TVs in the past and have generally had good luck. I bought one in 2019 that was little buggy and froze every once in a while, but it wasn't enough to warrant the hassle of a return. I just learned to deal with it.Then last December I bought this...thing. I don't even know where to start. It freezes incessantly, especially when streaming from YouTube, and it requires constant system resets. The picture and sound are OK when the TV is working, which is a 50/50 proposition. Same thing with the remote.I didn't use the TV all that much for the first month I owned it, so I didn't notice all the bugs, and after 30 days, you're screwed unless you buy an extended warranty. So now I have this large paperweight that isn't even worth donating to Goodwill.TCL's prices have dropped substantially over the years, and there's an obvious reason for that. Save yourself a headache and spend a few more dollars on a Samsung or an LG. I wish I had.

  For the price, I probably shouldn't be complaining but I just haven't been thrilled with this TV. My primary gripe is that the remote is really slow to respond to commands and sometimes, I'll need to push buttons several times to get it to work. Volume adjustment is a particular issue with me having to continually push the buttom and try different angles to get it to adjust. The TV also lags in its responses when you exit an application - I'll hit the back button while I'm watching a program to end it, and the screen will go black but the audio will continue for another 10 seconds or more. Overall, it's not bad enough to send back, picture is good and sound is fine, it does the job - just a little frustrating at times.

  Set up was incredibly easy. Not sure why so many reviews below had so many issues with scammers? I set up a roku account online and easily hooked up my account to the tv in less than 5 minutes. The best part about the tv was definitely the price and how easy it is to set up. The image quality is good and the tv has all the apps you would ever need. If you’re like me and don’t pay for cable but have a number of streaming services, then this tv is foryou. The only issue I really have is how slow the apps work. Sometimes it takes Plex or Hulu a while to load and kicks me off sometime for poor internet connection. I have the fastest google fiber you can get and shouldn’t have any streaming issues. Whenever I check the network connect on the tv it always says there were no issues detected so not sure why it tells me my conection is bad when I’m the only person on the network? Anyways, if you just want a cheap, decent TV, I would recommend this but don’t expect “Samsung” (my other tv brand) quality is terms of speed and picture. But again, it’s less than $200So it was worth it to me.Updating my review to a one star just because after having the TV for two months it is always freezing and laggy and slow and can beever catch up with the remote. Splurge for another tv because this one just isn’t worth the annoyance.

",4.0 ,Michael G,"Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2019","









  
  
    
  I think this is a great TV.  The picture quality was surprisingly good for the price.  This TV was mounted on the wall of our travel trailers bedroom.  It is very light for its size and hangs very nicely.I did not want a huge TV, since the bedroom is small, but it had to be 1080p.  I am surprised how many smart TVs this size are not 1080p.  Even the 17"" screen on my laptop is 1080p.  We often will connect a laptop to the TV to watch movies.The sound is very good too.  It is not theater sound, but very good for a $200 tv.  It is loud enough to easily hear over the rooftop A/C which sits between the TV and the bed (anyone that owns a RV knows even ducted rooftop A/C units are loud).It did take longer to setup over other TVs.  I did not see an option to skip the Roku setup, which is the most time consuming part, but it did go smoothly.  Connecting to our WiFi router (yes we have one in our travel trailer) was easy.  I have noticed that the TV, every once in a while, will claim it needs an internet connection even though it states it is connected when confirming the connection.  The WiFi router is less than 10 feet from the TV.I don't live the remote.  It is nice and smooth, which is great for our small bedroom, but there could be a lot more buttons.  It makes simple tasks more time consuming having to go through a menu.I also wish the Roku Media Player supported more video codecs.  We have a NAS in our travel trailer that contains all of our DVDs in digital format.  A lot of our older movies were ripped in AVI format and the media player does not support AVI.  It only seems to support MP4.For $200, I highly recommend this TV if you think you can deal with the very limited remote capability.

  I really want to like this TV, but the response from the remote is so piss poor. I even bought a new remote and that did not help.No matter what app I am in the TV constantly does not respond to signals from the remote. Example, I press the button to move to the next selection, nothing happens. So I press the button again to move to the next selection. The result is either it moves to the next selection, it still does not move to next selection, or it moves 2-3 selections past where you are trying to go.The phone app remote works well, but I really do not like having to use that app remote cause of the hassle of each time I wake the phone having to connect to the appropriate device; we have many Rokus.We also have a 43 inch TCL TV that does not have these problems.

  I am a huge fan of TCL and their TV's until I bought this one. Their tech support could be much better.There is an issue with the TV's software that affects the remote control once a network is configured. The only way I can get to have a working remote (without using the APP on a smartphone) is by not configuring the network at all. I been battling TCL  and loosing on this issue for about 3 weeks now. I even had Amazon ship me a new TV, same model, only to have the same exact issue.My rub with support is that I need to ship the TV to them at my expense. They would ship me a replacement one once they receive mine. And because they are just following a process the New TV will likely have the same issue.Here is a short summary:he issue: Once the TV is configured, the TV IR remove becomes unresponsive. (prior to configuration, IR Remote works as expected)I looked at the environment where I had the TV placed, covered up some large mirrors, removed anything that could possibly interfere with the IR. No go same issueTried multiple TCL remotes (I had 3 of them) with new fresh batteries. No go same issueIf I use the Roku app on my Cell phone, I am able to use and navigate functions as expected, but then again not really using IR and this is not the preferred method of usage.Performed factory reset, Remote back responsive. Walked through the configuration this time I SKIPPED connecting to any WiFi network.  NO Issues with the remote Everything works as expected.Once the TV was up I configured the Wireless/Internet network successfully and registered the . This caused the remote to NOT function again.I connected to a different WiFi/Intenet network (Phone Hotspot) to rule out infrastructure components.  This caused the remote to NOT function again.Also Note that Once I successfully configured Wifi/Internet, whether there was the connections was active or inactive, this caused the remote not to function again.At this time, I did not connect the TV to any network so the remote is working; however this defeats the purpose of having a smart-TV. I have a third party device (Fire-stick) configured so I can use the Smart Functions.

  I’ve had the tv for a day. I enjoy it. It seemed to work quite well and I was happy with the response time of the menus. Pleasantly surprised even. Then after about an hour the remote starting crapping out. When navigating the menus I need to press the arrow keys multiple times. About half the time it moves two panels. The other 40% it doesn’t move at all, and about 10% of the time it works. I was trying to avoid buying another Apple TV but it looks like I’m stuck getting one.

  I’m very disappointed with this Tv and Roku TV support.  They state many places on the internet that ALL Roku TVs are Youtube TV compatible.  There is no search function for YouTube TV app and they have no phone support. If there is an answer to this, I would live to hear it.  We bought this for YouTube TV streaming.  They have 800+ apps available and YouTube TV is not one of them.  Or Amazon Video for that matter.

  Very easy to set up! TOOK A TOTAL OF 15 Minutes, to download all Roku apps and hook up to Wifi. I've had it for about 3 weeks now or so...The Picture is Good, Internal speakers have a Mid Soft Sound Volume, but its loud enough for a bedroom, and have a fan running in the room at the same time. I do Recomend it for a small to medium size room, due to the volume of the internal speakers. How everFor bigger rooms. Get a Soundbar. We hooked it up to our Vizio Soundbar to see how it would work using a Optical Cable, (Yes We've had issues with late sounds on previous brands like Vizio its self, being hooked up to it's own vizio sound bars) There was NO delay in sound to the picture. This also proves that it would make a good Living room tv for an apartment size or even smaller living rooms. However I am sure if you purchase the bigger size screen, if your into big TVs, or just have a bigger livingroom, you wont be disappointed.  Like I mentioned earlier, the picture is great, crisp and the options for the different picture modes are not bad at all, if you decide to mess with that. Our room is dark so we kept ours at a dim light with ""Movie Picture"" feature.Over all Good product, very much Worth the Money.

  This TV was super easy to set up. I like the menu and the picture quality is bomb. It does come with a regular Roku remote, which is nice when you're using the main menu of the TV. However, if you have satellite or cable tv and switch to that, there are no options to pair it to your Roke remote (vice versa) so you do have to juggle the two a bit.

  We purchased this TV for our gym in hopes we could quickly cast and/or connect our phones/tablets prior to workout. That’s simply not the case - this TV has the single most difficult UI for external inputs I’ve ever seen. Why can you simply not include a “source” functionality on the remote? You must jump thru multiple hoops to connect anything that’s not native to the tv (or tablet, Apple TV, phone, etc.) plugging an HDMI in and beginning your broadcast should not be this difficult.

  Here's the short of it: I had a crappy 10 year old Westinghouse TV with a 5 year old Roku device, and that setup had better picture quality and responsiveness than this brand new Smart TCL TV.  Picture quality - particularly image blacks - was worse than what I started with (even after multiple adjustments of the display settings). The TCL remote is highly unpredictable. Sometimes the remote doesn't register key presses at all, and other times, you press it once, and the TV responds as though you pressed it twice. In addition, the lack of an ethernet port on this TV creates a lot of buffering issues if you don't have top-notch internet (or a high-bandwidth router/modem).At the very least, buy a TV with an ethernet port (to address connectivity issues), or splurge for a better Smart TV with better remote reviews.

  As a long time user of the Roku, I figured this this would be the best of both worlds, however I’ve been plagued with issues since I got it.I’ve gone back and forth with customer support over the fact that the tv sensor isn’t responding to commands via remote. TCL suggested I change the batteries in the remote. I reset both the TV and the remote.  When that didn’t work, they sent a new remote. The sensor problem got even worse and after a call with customer support they sent me an email today saying I have to ship the TV back for repair which will take 7-10 business days.... about two weeks total once you include shipping to and from. This is utterly ridiculous. I’m super disappointed that the only solution is to repair the broken “new” TV I purchased a little over two months ago instead of sending an actual new one. If it wasn’t past the 30-day period, I probably could have gotten a full refund and a new TV before this 7-10 repair turnaround time.

It doesn't have to work by itself, it only needs to project what is provided to it by what is plugged in, via computer or video game or whatever.  I wanted a TV, that's all I wantedUpdate:  Still think this is a horrible TV.  To avoid having to create an account or give an email, I didn't set up the WIFI.  To get out of where I was, I turned off my WIFI so it couldn't register,  this kicked me back to the set up part  where I returned it back to factory settings and reset up without WIFI.  Hope you never lose the remote as there is no way to manually turn on the TV or manually do anything such as change the channel or change which HDMI port you want to use.  The remote is useless too.  You have power button and arrows, no numbers.  Normally I don't use a remote,  I turn on the TV and indicate the port for device I want to use and use my device.  Little to say, I hate this TV.

  Amazing price, great quality picture (but I am not an expert on that subject).  The Roku remote is easy to use; my wife prefers it to the Apple TV we also have connected (and which I use).  The TCL is apparently a bit dense about recognizing the Apple TV; I had to train the Apple TV how to set the volume.

  I love TCL tv’s. This is the second one I’ve bought off Amazon and it works great! I’ve bought a 50” and now this 40” for the bedroom and it’s got great picture and I love the smart tv feature of course. My friend who works with electronics said TCL are great choices compared to Vizio or other comparable brands. I’m sticking to these TCL tv for awhile and love how it is packaged and shipped by Amazon. Wonderful.

  Found this TCL 40"" TV at a decent price and decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, there isn't much to like. Upon initial installation, the menus and remote were slow to respond. Luckily, there was an update. Surely that must fix it; it did not.First, scrolling through menus and using the remote for keyboard purposes is a lesson in frustration. Every one to two clicks the TV stops functioning for three to five seconds while it processes your click. Typing my information into Netflix took a solid three minutes.Second, Amazon Prime Video and Music do not install. I have tried power cycling and even a factory reset in order to get Amazon to install. Maybe it is not just Amazon products, but it seems suspicious that the other apps I've installed (Netflix, Plex, Youtube) all installed properly and work fine. I do not know if this is an Amazon problem or TCL problem, but it is a problem and detrimental to the TV. I'm hoping to return this shortly and get a product from a higher-end manufacturer that I trust, such as LG or Samsung.It was worth a shot.

  I am not a TV enthusiast but I just moved into a new space and decided I would get a TV for when I have friends over and for occasional usage so this was a great TV for me and my needs. The set up was very easy. The smart TV did all the setup and connections relatively quickly. I just received it today. Turned it on and set it up to make sure it worked properly. I love the easy to use remote. Downloading the Roku App was a breeze and no I did not put my credit card information in (you can skip this step) I opened my Roku account with no issues. I will update this review in a month or so to see if I have any issues but everything is great for now.

  The reason you see bad reviews most time is that the people with an enjoyable experience with the product don't write reviews. The picture quality is great for the price. The speakers on the TV are just average. I love the Roku interface as there are so many choices.

  The picture is quite good.  I've had no issues with dead pixels.  I am a ""power user"", so when advanced features don't work, it is a problem for me.  However, for many people this TV might work just fine.The TV software itself has a few annoying bugs.* Randomly locks up when using remote* Randomly crashes back to home screen* If you use Audio leveling, over time, the audio desyncs, but without it programs have quiet voices and loud explosions.* I purchased an app and then 2 months later Roku took it away without warning and without offering any kind of credit.  It was only 1.99 so it's not like they broke my wallet, but still - paid apps do not seem to have guaranteed availability.I reported the bug of the audio leveling to their support but they closed my ticket after three days without responding.  That was in September, and it is still broken.Personally, I would not buy another Roku TV if this is the level of support I'm going to get for buggy software.

  Great value.  Very nice picture, crisp/clear and bright.  Built in speakers really are good enough as they are, which is never very impressive with any flat-screen television but the sound was clear and it has decent volume.  I connected an external speaker system and turned off the built in speakers so their quality really doesn't matter.  Set up was very simple.  Plug in any HDMI devices you need, turn it on.  It will ask for your WiFi details and an email address.  Roku sent me an email message and the rest of the account set up was on my phone.  You don't need to give it a credit card, scroll down and skip that step.  The Roku account is free, you only need to put a card on file if you are going to subscribe to premium services or buy movies directly through Roku.  If you already have Prime/Netflix/etc.  just load the app and log in once like usual.  It will ask you what devices are plugged into your HDMI ports (three of them, one of which is HDMI/ARC) and you can label them.  Adding apps or rearranging them on your home screen is simple.  The streaming apps are glitch free and as fast as your internet will allow them to be.  We stream to multiple sets simultaneously without issue.  BTW: You can download the Roku app for your phone and use it as the remote if you would rather.  I have no regrets about buying this system and strongly recommend it.

  Not a great tv. The picture is great but that’s about it. We noticing problems with it a few months after we bought it. It always kicks us off our apps and we have to login to reconnect the tv so we can stream. It happens with Netflix, Hulu and Prime so I know it’s the tv. Also, we can’t filter out tv channels we don’t want so whenever we watch live tv we have to sort through every station our antenna picks up to see what’s on. About a month ago (one year after purchase) the sound starting going out. We bought a sound bar in hopes it fix the problem but we have to adjust the speakers in settings every time we turn the tv back on.

  Ok, I admit along with the others, the remote leaves a lot to be desired. But the work arounds include a ROKU app download that includes voice activated commands. The set up can be a bit confusing for those not accustomed to the features it offers. However, you do NOT have to input any credit card information and if you go slow, you can get through it easily enough without any calls to an 800 number. Since I already have Netflix, HBO, Showtime and Amazon Prime, I was able to activate all of those accounts by syncing them with my cable service and installing the apps using the voice prompt. Example, I used the app voice feature and spoke ""HBO"" The TV asked if I wanted to install it and I used the up down arrow to say yes on the TV. It then gave me an activation code and the HBO website location to type in the code. Easy enough. The TV is lightweight and the stand legs are a bit on the small side, but I don't have kids, cats or dogs that will present a problem. I live in Florida and this will be outside on my deck and screen enclosure. I easily hooked up wireless TV headphones so I can enjoy it outside without disturbing the neighbors when I watch the news in the morning. All in all, despite what I read that was negative, I'm completely satisfied.

  Shocked is the best way to put it.  It is a nice TV but as I got to learn about I noticed one thing.  The folks at TCL did not put numerals on the Remote control.  At first I thought is was odd but I figured they (TCL) knew what they were doing. I figured wrong.  When I used my TCL in the bedroom and used the Xfinity App it became a real issue.  I go to the guide and it starts on channel one.  The channels I like are from 301 to 498.  The only way to get there is hit the up button one at a time.  It would take me 10 minutes to get there. Plus I would have to do that each time I go to the app.If I wanted to go to channel 431 and I was on 328 I cannot just enter the channel number because there are no numbers on the Remote.  That is a big enough flaw to return the TV I purchased.  One of the dumbest mistakes I have ever seen in technology.  I think the team at TCL really dropped the ball here.  I would not recommend this or any TV that offers a remote with no numbers.  Next time I will ask first.

My only complaint about this product is the remote; it's pretty terrible.

Whenever I use the remote (which is every time I watch TV), I have to repeatedly press the buttons until they work. This is an even more annoying issue when you realize you have to use arrow buttons on the remote to navigate the Roku OS. Whenever I want to watch a YouTube video or search for shows/movies, because I have to use the arrow buttons to navigate through the on-screen keyboard and type a show or video title. The remote buttons constantly don't register clicks, or click a letter twice leading to a lot of frustration when trying to watch something. Luckily, there's a Roku smartphone app, which can act as a better-functioning remote. I just wish the remote it came with worked better. Otherwise, I am generally happy with the quality of this smart TV for the low price it's sold at.

    Should have bought 2
  
",5.0 ,Scott Michael,"Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  There are people who complained about Wi-Fi not working, issues with registration, 2 star reviews for remote design which is a Roku issue, not TCLs. IMO, this TV is worth more than the $189.99 I paid for it. Picture quality is great -- TV looks great, movies look great, games look great. The only complaint I have with the TV is TCL implies the TV has a refresh rate of 120hz, and it does not. The Roku remote sucks, but so does my Roku Express remote. I should have bought 2.

  Super easy to set up.  The only configuration we have to tweak is hooking satellite tv receiver up with the Roku—might have to use both remotes in order to choose channels from our dish satellite.  My husband and I spent more time attaching the screen to our stand than actually setting things up to play the tv.  We already had Roku so it was a matter of resetting password and following prompts from the screen.Some things to consider:1. Make sure your stands or wall mounts fit the hardware!  We had purchased this tv to replace a Toshiba HiDef that was about 10 yrs old.  I have bracket mounts showing right now.  Will conceal with some florals at the top of the mount.2.  You may need  speaker system for sound.  I did find settings a bit tricky to find.  Knowing how to navigate smart tv functions is a must—TCL doesn’t clarify the settings features with the tv in their user manual.  I simply hunted for proper screen settings—the black end screen bars can be stretched to fit the full screen.3.  We probably could have gotten the 50 inch tv to better fit our stand—the width of the screen is quite narrow on this model.  We were not sure how this tv would fit on our tv stand.Otherwise, so far so good!  My husband and I appreciate the affordability of this smart tv.  Just wished we had gotten a little bigger one for our stand.  This one is very nice for the money—our satellite channels are really beautiful pictures!!For a starter smart tv, this one is an excellent buy!  Might add that Amazon was very prompt in processing our order and shipment that came today about 2 hours ahead of its scheduled delivery time with UPS.

  The cord on this tv is off to the left side (when facing the tv) and extremely short so I could not hang this very high on the wall, it looks stupid as hell. Also, I have an Apple TV 4K and I was able to get this to turn on and start up with the Apple TV but I can’t figure out how to get the Apple TV remote to control the volume, which is ridiculous because all of my other TVs that are different brands are automatically recognized by the remote. TCL is completely unhelpful. Would not purchase again.

  The remote on this model feels cheaper than the 52"" model (which we have in the living room). There's a noticeable difference in the quality. If you're looking for a cheap TV I recommend this one but if you pay for the next model up you'll get what you pay for with the higher quality peripheral.

  I like this tv, and for the money I am greatly impressed. Would I recommend you purchase one? Yes, with one small warming: if you have another Roku Tv in the vicinity-- even one made by another company - you May find that either remote will activate both Tv's at the same time. You read that correctly: turn on one tv and you'll turn on the other one at the same time. This is a known problem: if you Google it, you'll see that this is a known problem.  Yet, TCL Customer Support  told me this is my problem not theirs. And they disavowed that this is a known problem.  Great TV.  GREAT price. Great picture quality. But if you have a second Roku tv nearby beware.

",2.0 ,LL,"Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was taken in by the positive reviews and I have a Roku account.  I mounted the TV on the wall, attached an antenna for OTA and connected it to my wi-fi.  The remote took four or five pushes to get a response.  Sometimes it would work on the first push, but most times it took 4 or more pushes to get a response.  It did not matter what part of the control system you were in.  I contacted tech support, followed their troubleshooting advice, but no luck.  TCL was nice enough to send me another remote.  Again, the same 4+ pushes to get anything to happen.  At this point tech support tells me I have a defective TV, for me to take it off the wall, ship it back to them, then wait 7 to 10 days until they determine if it really is defective.  They said they will repair the TV and send it back to me.  This means at best I would wait  2 weeks with no TV, and when I get it back, I would have paid full price for a refurbished item.  It has since been return to Amazon for a full refund.

  This is the second of this Television I have purchased in a year. This is after 5 months this time another dead tv. They have the worst support, the worst warranty, and generally once you have it you are stuck with it as is. Even the replacement policy purchased says in first year this is TCL's problem and they basically say there is nothing to be done and do not replace!

  My old TV was dumb and having power supply problems.  I didn't really want a smart TV, but didn't seem to have a choice.  After some research, I chose this model and now understand the convenience of a smart TV.  I find the picture on to be perfectly acceptable and the sound isn't bad. I frequently pipe the sound through my amp though.  The remote can be a little weird - doesn't always respond quickly, and on some apps, like Prime Video, it frequently jumps two spaces for one button click.  Because I watch things from a variety of sources, mostly Hulu and Prime, I am loving this TV.  Before I had to watch them through a computer that uses the TV as a monitor.  I think this TV is a good value for the money, and after researching Smart TV operating systems, I think Roku is the way to go.

  This screen was two technology generations behind when I bought it, but it was an upgrade from my ten-year-old 32-inch, 720p, LCD Samsung.  First, I acknowledge this is a low-end, low-priced video screen, so its limitations were to be expected. It has a great picture, love the picture. But It hasn't the range of controls that the Samsung possessed, such as sound equalization or fine-tuning of various picture qualities. And it has really bad speakers. They sound like they're under water. I'm sure they saved two, maybe three dollars by using cheap speakers. I bought a Dell AC511 USB Wired SoundBar from Amazon to compensate, cost just under $23.

  Pro: Great picture. Roku is easy to set up and use. Remote control has buttons for Netflix, Sling, Hulu, and Amazon and Icons on the home screen to help you find these and other services.Con: For TV use, the remote control doesn't have channel numbers so the only way you can find the station you want is to go through each one. We don't have cable, just antenna. I assume a cable remote control would work better.Someone said you had to have register to use but I assume he was talking about one of the subscription services or maybe the ROKU function. We have had ROKU before and registration is routine. The TV itself is ready to go.

  The picture quality is great, however, trying to do anything with the remote has made me stop watching this TV entirely.  You can click the remote 10 times to finally get the TV to respond.

So it's not the remote, it's how the TV responds to the remote.  Nothing's obstructing it.

  This is the first smart TV I have ever purchased so I was a bit unsure about how well it would work. I have to say, though, I'm thrilled with it.The set up was really easy. I chose to have it stand on a desk instead of putting it on a wall. I was worried that it would be flimsy but it did not shake at all. I needed a small Philips screwdriver but that was all. The remote control came with batteries which was really good because I did not have any.The Roku was really easy to set up, it only took about 5 minutes to add everything.I'm really happy with this purchase and also thrilled because it did not cost a fortune. 10/10

  Roku works well with the apps (can't say the same for the cheaper Alexa TVs).However, this particular model has issues with the audio.  If you use the Leveling feature the audio stops working after a bit. You have to unplug the TV and let it sit for a bit. It's good picture and easy to work otherwise.I will order another ROKU TV without hestitation.

    TCL Roku 40' inch Flat Screen TV
  
",5.0 ,Denise Reid,"Reviewed in the United States November 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  I hadn't purchased a new TV in over 15 years.  My first flat screen 32' inch Emmerson TV was given to me about 2 years ago and I added the Roku streamer.  I love it because it serves it's purpose in the bedroom.  However, I wanted a flat screen, but mainly a Roku TV for the living room and needed to keep the size between 40 - 42' inches.  It took approximately one month for me to conduct research and I made my final selection on the TCL Roku 40'in. Flat Screen TV.  It was quite an easy set-up.  Extremely happy with the amount of research I conducted before making this wonderful purchase.

  We have had nothing but problems with this TV. We exchanged it for another one and are having still the SAME issues. Television won’t keep its connection to the Internet (we have to manually connect the Internet every time we turn on the TV), it is SOOOOOO slow, always buffering, the remote is always lagging with tv connection. We are just so disappointed in this purchase. Purchased it as a black Friday deal, and got rid of our old TV. Now we are stuck with this TV since we already got rid of the old one and can’t afford a non-Black Friday tv price. Sad. Beware of the “great deal”

  I love the televisions, but the sound going out is a deal breaker.  For the amount of money I spent, I expected them to last at least a year.  Great picture, great smart capability.  I had to buy a sound bar for the 40 inch, but the 55 doesn't even have sound with a sound bar.  I wouldn't buy another TCL product for that reason.

    Great TV - SoSo Remote
  
",4.0 ,Shawn,"Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  Bought 2 of these for our kid's room. Overall we are pleased with the purchase. The built in apps makes finding shows the kids want to watch easy for them to do. I asked a question on here yesterday about what size USB will the TV recognize. I used 8gb ones with no issues but when I tried 64gb the TV would not pick it up. After some trial and error I formatted it to a NTFS and BINGO the TV picked it up just fine. So if anyone is having issues try converting your drive to NTFS and you should be good to go. The only complaint I really have is the remote. You sometimes seem to have to aim it directly at the bottom of the TV for it to pick up. I have watched my daughter walk up to the TV to get it to work. Not a deal breaker of an issue but can be annoying at times.

  Amazon comes through once again, on a Friday sent one back, it was damaged , replacement here Monday morning. Other vendors could learn a lot from Amazon!!  First rule don't use Fed Ex.  Anyhow, the TV was easy to hook up, easy to use, easy to find the menus, great buy.  Because the TV is so light, I suggest laying it out, plugging it in and setting up before mounting, let it go through all the updates, turn off, makes sure everything works, then mount. Thank you Amazon for doing what you do best ship!!

  Perfectly good tv with a great picture but the remote really sucks.  You have to hit any button severl times and hope it registers and that's with fresh batteries.UPDATE:  Brought the wireless remote from Roku ($19.99) and it fixed all my problems.  You even get voice control. No more having to push the mute button fiver times to get it to work.I'm upping my rating because the tv is really rather good when to remote problems are sorted.

  This television replaced a floor model tube television that was over twenty years old of our 85 year old neighbor.  I had to call the 800 number on the plans to help me get the screen size right on her format but it was fairly easy to fix when I called.  The picture quality is good.  They should send codes for the cable companies so we do not need to look them up and connect the cable remotes to the new television remotes.  It took only ten minutes to set the television up overall.

",3.0 ,Vasily,"Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2019","









  
  
    
  It can't play .avi files (the most basic video file format that has been around forever). It does not support exFAT formatting system (I plugged in my hard drive and it just did not work). The interface of the built-in video player looks like it was designed in 2004. After a week of usage, the TV became very slow and buggy so I had to restart it. Overall, it's not the experience that I was expecting.Oh, and apparently you have to ""activate"" your TV. It wants your e-mail, your address, and your credit card number.I wish I knew all of this before buying. Those are too minor to return it, but I am not very happy about this purchase. I suspect other brands have those issues as well, but I don't want to spend a day choosing my tv.

  The TV is excellent and weighs about 10 lbs.  You have to register it using a code.  I tried doing so with my phone but it didn't work.  So I called a number on the registering app -  Turns out I must have entered the website wrong and then dialed a scam number.  This guy told me I needed to pay $99 to register the TV.  I said not a chance bozo I'll read the manual and send it back If I have to pay anything else with the TV.  I called the number in the manual and the woman said there is no cost to register the TV and that the first number must have been a scam.

  DO NOT BUY THIS TV ITS NOT WORTH IT.  It doesn't connect to WiFi and if it does Everytime it is turned on you'll have to re connect it yourself or wait an hour for it to auto connect. Now remember this is if you can get it to connect at all. When you call the makers of the TV on their support line their 1 and only solution was to unplug the TV and plug it back in. Awful customer service. Awful product. Awful everything. Don't waste your money buy from a better brand. Even at 200$ it's not worth it because for them to call it a smart TV is false.  I'm sending it back in getting my money back.

  This TV had no picture. I think it was from the screen having a huge crack in it. Yes, I am sure that's it. I think one feature that it lacks is some sort of protection before I opened it, but I can't talk about that, per Amazon's rules. Yet, having an adequate cushion is very important. Very disappointed. I love my other Roku TVs from TCL but this one was doomed. TCL should rework this feature.

  I got 3 of these 40"" TV's for the bedrooms at $199 plus tax and I am very pleased with them. Great picture, easy set up and an over all great value. They do have Roku built in so you do have to go thru some steps at Roku.com/link to set up your Roku account. If you already have an account it's even easier. There was no problem connecting to my WIFI and navigating with the remote is pretty simple.

   I replaced this TV 3 times with Amazon. Returns were seamless as usual and customer service really stepped up to the plate. But all three sets had the same exact issue. I finally gave up and bought a different brand. It works well for a few days, maybe up to two weeks and then all it does is recycle on and off. During the recycle you cannot turn on or off the TV either from the remote or on the TV itself.  See video.

  After successfully setting up the TV, less than five minutes later the screen went completely black. White light at the bottom of the screen is a dim white, and the TV is unresponsive to both the remote and the actual power button on the TV. After communicating with TCL support, I was told that the TV had to be sent in for repair or be returned. This was on the first day of use. Extremely disappointed in this product.

  I previously left a very negative review for this product.  First I do stand by my statement about the panel.  It is cheap and can be damaged with very little effort.  TCL needs to stop using tape with what amounts to super glue to secure the panel.I resolved networking issues by performing multiple updates. Packet captures indicate loss and drop of less then 15% so not too bad on WIFI.  I was able to find advanced settings, navigation is confusing in that video and audio settings have to be done in a channel?  Not logical to the consumer but if you think about it you want to set your picture settings when your looking at something besides a grey screen.The supplied media player ONLY SUPPORTS H.264 and MKV files for video.  If your media is AVI or MPEG your not going to be able to use that using the media player.  You can however use PLEX as long as you set up a PC or something else as a Plex server.  Most will prefer that anyway. I complained about brightness.  By default the system comes on low  power settings.  The Panel is a bright LED, but it will use more power.  It has multiple options for picture quality and sound.  The Roku App is outstanding, not issues there.  The software is actually very good , the hardware is a little lax but good for the price.  Again the panel will break with almost no effort.  USB port is a little hard to get to TCL should reconsider the width of the port access panel. The remote is simple and easy to use.  Navigation is fast.  Sound quality is actually better than my Samsung 60 inch that I paid over a grand for.  I have yet to test antenna quality video.Last, the TV does have bluetooth however do not expect to use it without paying Roku $200 for a set of speakers.  Roku decided to block any bluetooth use unless you connect their speakers.  Once you connect the speakers you can connect bluetooth devices. The speakers have mixed reviews and I do not agree with this type of ""product functionality ransom"" that so may companies are moving towards.While you could actually hack this by setting up a device with the MAC address of the speakers there is a simple way to work around it.  There are many cheap bluetooth transmitters here on Amazon you can purchase that plug into the audio out.  This will get you around the issue for about $30.  Just be sure to get one that is not just battery powered but can be plugged in.Overall the functionally of the menu, the apps and the stability of the software is outstanding.  Given the price, this is an exceptional buy.  Just be warned it comes with some caveats.I will update my review if I find any new exceptions.  I stand by my rating.

  Amazing tv for the price. It reads hard drives and thumb drives from the USB port(the harddrives have to be the proper format first). It plays most formats of pictures, music, & video.The smart tv channels have a lot of media to choose from if you have wifi. There are lots of cable channel apps like HGTV, TBS, etc. that offer both paid media and free media. It looks like the first season of a lot of the shows are available free, then you need a subscription to the channel to see current media. My wifi is limited, so I won't be watching much of these channels for a while.The app for the tv is great. It doubles as a remote, but also can play media straight from your device wireless. I only tried the android app. I was able to write a program for my tablet that turns on the tv and plays music videos from the hhd as an alarm. Now I get to wake up to Taylor Swift singing me awake.The only bad thing I have found is that the tv doesn't have Bluetooth, which is very disappointing. The speakers on the TV seem to be on the back, so they are only so good.*I paid full price for this item *

While the new tv had a much better picture, the QAM tuner failed to detect several channels the old tv received. I could find no way to manually enter a channel. Frustrated tv’s 10-15 year older have better tuner.Remote batteries were dead as well
