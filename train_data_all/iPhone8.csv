    Not worth it.

  When I first opened it it looked fine but then I went to turn it on and it took like an hour to even get it on. After that I went to charge the phone and it says it's on 1 percent all the time and when I have it on the charger it doesn't do anything and I've tried with 2 chargers. I'm debating on whether I should pay to fix it or just return the phone because it's so impractical and doesn't work even close to right.

  To begin , my seller was Chubbiestech, the phone arrived two days early in the AmazonRenewed box, included was a charger, cord, screen protector, and sim tool. The phone itself was pristine, absolutely spotless. Zero scratches, dents, or marks. And it has 91% of it's battery capacity. the phone functions perfectly, it arrived in such a condition that i would have thought it was a brand new phone straight from the Apple store!. I had been reading some of the concerning negative reviews and decided to purchase this phone, i do not regret it one bit. i am very pleased.

    Works as well as the iPhone 7 it replaced.
  
",5.0,JimBob,"Reviewed in the United States November 26, 2019","









  
  
    
  As the title says, works as well as the iPhone 7. Replaced it because I thought a problem was hardware related (turned out it wasn’t). Do like the expanded 64 GB memory over the 32 GB memory of the 7 because I can have my entire music library onboard. Use music, podcasts, calendar, all of it. Signing in to my account, the phone filled with all my apps and data. Honestly don’t notice it’s much faster with updated chip and I seldom use the camera, so newer features don’t make a significant difference to me but bottom line is is works as well as I’m used to. Will use it until I upgrade to iPhone 12 when that comes out, so I can be ready for 5G when it really it deployed and working (most places have little to no 5G, regardless of what the ads say).

  I had a great experience with this purchase thus far. After reading some reviews about possible issues I was concerned and contacted seller. They responded quickly (10-20min) with multiple questions I had and related information about the T-Mobile only iPhone I had purchased and made me feel very comforable with the purchase. A+ customer service was my experience and the phone is in great shape for ""renewed"". Will update if needed. With phone and network carriers it pays to do a little homework sometimes.

  Yes the shutter sound can’t be turned off but by just using Live mode to take photos that is resolved. The phone was for my wife and she likes the shutter sound (who knows why?) so zero problem either way. Phone arrived indistinguishable from new. Shiny and scratch free. Setup was easy. SIM card from old phone worked perfectly. Charged extremely fast and battery seems to last a long time. We added the extended warranty. A 256GB phone for less than $300 can’t be beat.

  I got this with international shipping to South Africa, the packaging seemed really secured. And still, I received a half cracked home button on this phone. I’m highly doubtful it was due to shipment damage, this was meant to be a gift so I’m very VERY disappointed. The post clearly stated that the phone was “Professionally inspected, tested, and cleaned to work and look like new.”. I provided some images but my old phone doesn’t have the best camera quality. If you’re looking for a seller who keeps their promises, this is not the place to purchase from. I don’t recommend at all!

  I was so nervous about ordering a refurbished iPhone off Amazon but this was worth the money! I've had the phone for about a week now and I have no complaints. Cosmetically, there were a few scratches by the power button and on the lower left portion of the screen but I put on a case and glass screen protector so you can't even see the scratches anymore. My phone came with 90% battery health remaining. My T-mobile sim card booted up just fine and I had no issues with creating getting the phone set up. Would recommend!

  I ordered the fully unlocked version. When it came in the mail it was in new condition, no scratches or dings, and it came with the charger and tool to get my sim card out. We have a plan with Verizon, I was able to take out my sim from my old IPhone and put it in this one and it turned on and loaded all my stuff with zero issues. My phone is working fine and the battery life is just as good if not better than my last phone. So far no bugs or glitches. I'm very happy with my purchase. There were a lot of mixed reviews so I was skeptical on buying it but I'm glad I did! Plus it came with an amazon backed warranty so if one came defective I didn't feel like I would loose my money. My advice would be to pay close attention to your selection when adding the phone to your cart for service options and when in doubt go for the fully unlocked version.

  I received an iPhone 8 that was purchased as an upgrade for my sons 13th birthday this phone is listed as fully unlocked on amazon when we tried to activate it through our phone service they were unable to do so because the phone is said to be listed with a carrier already. Now we have a phone that while it appears to look great does not work for our service provider so does us NO GOOD!!! How disappointing to have purchased this as a gift only to have to turn around and tell someone it’s not able to be activated. I don’t know how well it works because I cannot even activate it.

  I bought the iPhone 8 256. It looked like new when I received it. It did not come in the original iPhone box. It came in a cardboard box with the plug in to charge it and the little metal piece for SIM card. It worked great in every aspect except that I noticed the sound quality was not as good as my iPhone 5s, the sound was more “tinny” sound, probably not noticeable to others, but it was for me. I don’t know if it was a defect or how the iPhone 8 was made. It just startled me when I would use it for an alarm clock playing music. I did not have any problem at all returning the iPhone. The package came with a card that had their phone number and email address, backed by Amazon. There is a 90 day warranty and I turned it back in shortly before the 90 days was up. When I spoke with the customer service, they were really nice and just wanted to know what was wrong with the iPhone. I was sent an email with the return label and I sent it back with no problem and got a full refund. Even though the phone did not work out for me, I would still recommend this company because of their great service and following through with what they say they will do.

  I should have known better- as soon as I tried to turn the phone on to set it up, there were problems. The phone was not responding to charging or me pressing the home/power buttons.I finally got it to turn on and assumed it was just a freak occurence (I was mistaken) and began to set up the phone. The phone kept resetting itself or shutting down completely throughout the night. Again, I blamed it the amount of data I was transferring from my old phone. (mistaken again)I used the phone for a few days, and it reset or shut down probably an average of 5 times a day. Sometimes the phone would freeze completely and become unresponsive to any buttons, touching, or even my attempts to force it to shut down. I would just have to leave it alone for an hour or until it reset itself again.I ended up returning the phone, and asked to exchange it for one that worked. The company faied to do so and sent me a refund instead. Now I am without a phone right before the holidays and must scramble to find a new one. I will not be buying this phone ever again and I recommend that you don't either.

  I don’t always write reviews but I’m so happy with the condition of the iPhone I got, no visible scratches or dents. I get all my calls and text messages I just put my old at&t SIM card in and it works perfectly. Only downside is battery maximum capacity is 83%. But I feel that is fair enough because the product description says >80% which it is. Don’t buy one of these if you need a better battery life.

  I was really excited to try Amazon Renewed for my teenage daughters cell phone. I ended up ordering two and neither one worked with our service provider. The first one I bought said it would work with all carriers, took it to the store and it wouldn’t work with their network. The second one I got for sprint and it was originally sold as a prepaid phone and I don’t have a prepaid contract with sprint so they couldn’t use it on my account. Very disappointed in finding out it was originally sold as prepaid in the store and not in the Amazon description. I feel like that’s something very easy to check on before listing it for sale. Ended up returning both phones and didn’t repurchase from Amazon Renewed.

",2.0,Rshop,"Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2019","









  
  
    
  Phone arrived on time, and looked completely new.  Was easy to set up and worked exactly as expected.  After two weeks, if I was out and was carrying the phone in a bag it would begin to randomly execute functions.  Initially I thought I had been hacked, but I read on line that this probably means the screen installation is faulty.  Unfortunately this happened  while I was on vacation, so I ended up being without a cell phone during my trip whenever I was out of the house.  It also deleted all my music (which I was able to re load when I returned home).  It then took another week to call and obtain the postage paid label and buy a replacement phone once I returned home, so I was without a mobile phone for several weeks.  I have bought refurbished phones in the past without any problem.  I intend to try again to buy a refurbished phone as it is the phone I want, it did look perfect, the battery life seems good, and the price is very good.

  For those of you trying to suss out which seller is best through the aggregated reviews, I ordered my from Electro Wireless. The phone took about a week to ship out, but to be fair I ordered just before the Fourth of July and I can see how that would gum up the works. It arrived within a day of being shipped though, so that made up for it.The phone looks immaculate (no scratches or dents). So far I've had no issues (though it's only been 24 hours). I booted it up, put in my sim, placed calls, sent texts, changed display settings, tested the speakers with my music, etc....anything I could really think to test I did. The phone came with the tool to open the sim tray, a USB plug, and charge cable (the plug and cable are not Apple products, which I expected, but since some reviews act surprised, I'll confirm for those of you who think that really matters).There are two minor downsides. The battery capacity is only at 89% right now. While that's still entirely useable, at 80% the battery is essentially dead/needs replaced. So I've only got 9% to use, though I'm not sure how long that will take me to run down so maybe that doesn't matter. The second downside is they also send a tempered glass screen protector, BUT, it's unfortunately the wrong size. Not sure if it's for the 8S or a newer iPhone, but it sure isn't for the regular old 8. I ordered a case anyway, so it's not really an issue for me.

Yet for some reason Siri what type what I was saying on the screen as I spoke to her proving the device could understand my words. BUT the stupid witch never helped me or followed commands (even ""call home"" was misdirected)! After talking to Siri, now I know how men feel when they talk to women!!!! The battery only lasted a few hours with mild to moderate use, no videos. The actual phone itself is really small if you're starting to have eye or dexterity issues it's pain in the butt. And apparently Apple doesn't have a back button, the middle button is the only button on the front. The programmed user manual is a joke. The steps count and sleeping tracker are not accurate. This phone was nothing but a lesson in frustration.PLUSSES:  if you are coming from Android it let's u use many Google apps & will remember your Google login once entered to allow you to more seamlessly transition between Google and Apple. It was fast and easy transferring my content from my Android to the iPhone.  If you are the type that likes actually pushing a button the main button is actually push/click, not just a spot on a screen. However pushing and clicking it sometimes it ignores you anyways. The signal reception was fairly good and the Wi-Fi calling worked very well. That being said the audio itself was not very clear, it sounded like a cheap phone.

    iPhone 8 256GB Space Gray Unlocked GSM
  
",5.0,RxH,"Reviewed in the United States September 26, 2019","iPhone 8 256GB Space Gray Unlocked GSM

What came in the box
1. iPhone 8 256GB Space Gray Unlocked GSM
2. Lightning Cable
3. USB Plug
4. Original Box

What was not in the box
1. Earphones
2. SIM Card Removal Tool
3. User Manual

The cable and plug are white and wrapped in plastic just like what you would get if it was new from Apple. I cannot tell if these are originals.

Earphones
Have always used 3rd party so not getting a set was not a deal breaker.

Phone Condition
Body is in very good condition. There are paint flecks on the corners, maybe dropped on a hardwood floor, it is smooth to the touch, not deep so it does not appear to have been dropped on concrete, pavement or other rough surface and it is not a light scratch from carrying it in a pocket.

Screen Condition
It came with a screen protector already applied. If there are any scratches I cannot tell. With the protector on, it looks pristine.

A bummer since it was not mentioned in the ad and I had purchased a case and screen protector for it. I always protect the phone before it goes outside.

It’s an expensive device so why people don’t protect it from day one I’ll never know, I guess some don’t care. I have a spare screen protector now.

Battery Condition  Battery Health says 91% Maximum Capacity relative to when it was new, 86% charge on startup.

Even though capacity says 91%, I am not having issues where I am out of juice early. Over a day with moderate use, heavier use I would need to recharge around 06:00pm-07:00 pm. This of course is a YMMV.

Setting it up
Phone was already reset. You set it up just like if it came straight out of the factory.

Camera
No scratches on the lens and photos come out crisp and sharp.

Speakers
No issues, sound is very good. No hissing, cracks or pops.

Microphone, Lighting Port
No issues. Works.

Phone came with iOS 12.3.1 installed. So far I have not come across any issues that would give me pause on the purchase. Phone is working as expected and the ad says phone is like new and I would have to agree.
 Amazon tends to lump all the reviews together, regardless of seller so you can’t tell which negative review belongs to who. It’s as if it was all sold by one seller. Reviewers need to say who their seller was.

My seller was MobileDealz and at the time they were a little bit cheaper than most.  
This phone debut at 849.00 + tax on September 22, 2017. Nearly 2 years later it is has seen a 50%+ price drop. I don’t need the latest and greatest, a gently used phone is just as good.",Size: 256GBColor: Space GrayService Provider: T-MobileProduct grade: Renewed

  I purchased this refurbished phone 3/7/2020 for $229.96.  Prior to purchasing the phone, I  asked about the battery life.  Now, the battery is dead as of 8/5/2020, less than 5 months after purchase.  Usage cost me $45.99/month average based on purchase price.  I could have had a current brand new  IPhone for that monthly usage cost.  Do not use this vendor.  They should have replaced the battery as a good will gesture even if past warranty date.  As a business owner, that is how I would have taken care of a customer to earn future business from them.  Shame on ELECTRONIC DEALS.Reply from  vendor:Hi Brigitte, we are very sorry to hear this. Unfortunately, the order is past 90 days old and the warranty period has expired. We suggest taking the device in to Apple or a local authorized Apple technician for repair.We sincerely apologize for the inconveniences caused.Kind Regards,ELECTRONIC DEALS FAMILY & STAFF

  Received a defective phone:1. The boot screen would display a line either above or below the Apple logo occasionally. It would either show as a green line or a static line2. There was occasional lag when swiping through home screens and opening apps. I compared it to a friends iPhone 8 and the problem was specific to the phone I received3. The touch screen would not respond occasionally4. The battery would not display correct percentages. I once had the phone charging for 20 minutes and the percentage did not increase at all. After restarting the phone it showed the correct percentage.  This also happened while using the phone — the percentage would not decrease until restarting the phone5. The speaker sound quality sounded poor compared to my friends iPhone 8

For $199, I now have an iphone for work so that I can check email and calendar. I still use my Android, but my work only allows iPhones for exchange access due to Apple's stringent security updates.

  The phone I have now works so well, it's in seemingly perfect condition! For what I paid for a used phone, I feel the seller deserves praise for the product at the end of the day. I wish I could give four stars. There were several communication issues/ product issues that I felt took this order in a wonky direction. 1.) The order was sent to my address with signature required. When I asked to remove the required signature (I'm not home all the time), the package was sent the next day to a location one state away. Rather than spend another four to five days without a phone, I chose to drive a half hour through a different state to pick up the package at the FedEx facility. Okay.2.) The first phone stopped working after a few weeks. Believe me, being without a phone for a few days can be a risky issue (I don't even have a phone at home, what if I had to call 911? My employer? Etc.) They gave me a VERY quick and flexible response, saying they would replace or return the phone. Amazing response! They told me to remove my iCloud info and delete the email app, which was impossible because it wouldn't even turn on, but no problem, they removed the iCloud account and email when I turned it in somehow. However, they did not mention that I would have to hold onto the SIM card!So they sent me a new iPhone, nice model, everything fine, except- no SIM card. 3.) No SIM card. By this time the world was in the middle of an epidemic crisis, my carrier was closed except for in one location (fine) but the carrier veritably chased me away yelling at me to call because they had no functioning service (not fine - no phone.) After all the drama I figured out how to call them without activation on my own. A few days later I got the SIM. Anyway, the NEW phone works outstandingly, the exchange was smooth, they were very fast at messaging and did a terrific job of offering me an exchange immediately with no extra fees. However the lack of notice about a signature requirement upon delivery, the first phone battery stopping completely, and the lack of communication about holding my old SIM card backed up my phone use. I'm all set now though. Four stars.

  Received the phone and it seemed ok at first. The IOS was about 3 major versions old so I tried to update it, but for some reason it couldn’t.  Long story short, after several hours of trying to fix it and a few more with apple support, it was determined that the hardware was bad. Seems like this could have been determined when doing their QA, but I’m guessing they don’t do much if any. On top of all this after finding out that they sent me a bad phone, I had to pay for the return myself.  Happy ending is that I found the same exact phone for about $30 cheaper on another site and this one worked!

  After reading some of the reviews on the reseller BUYSPRY I was actually terrified of buying this phone. Probably one of the riskiest clicks I've had to do.However, the phone arrived neatly packaged, exactly as advertised, with cable & wall charger and it looked brand new. There were a few light scratches on the screen and on the glass behind but the type of scratches that are only visible under certain angles and with lots of light - Personally not a problem at all. At first glance, it looks absolutely spotless - like a new phone. Battery capacity/health (the you can check at settings) was at 97% which seems pretty good. Overall, so far ZERO complaints. Phone looks amazing & works just as good.

  The good:1. The phone was delivered in a timely fashion just before Christmas.2. It looked perfect, no physical defects.The bad & the ugly:1. I discovered the phone came from Japan where the camera sound cannot be turned off, by law. Took it to the Apple Store, and said they couldn't do anything about it. I take a lot of photos, and the loud click is a pain. But, that was a minor detail for the price.2. Most importantly, the phone locked up suddenly. The Apple Store couldn't unlock it. The only way was to wipe it clean to factory settings. Lost everything that wasn't stored in the cloud, including my photos. The phone has a 256 GB memory. Didn't want to bother with paying extra storage space in the cloud. Let's hope this doesn't happen again... Or else, monthly payments on a NEW phone may no longer look as optional... :(

    Great Condition and Easy to Set Up

  I've been an iPhone user for the past 13 years, and while I love the interface and design, I do not like paying the high price for a new phone. Last month, after dropping my iPhone 6 (I know I'm very behind on the models, but it still worked well!), I made the decision to upgrade. I love that I can use Amazon Renewed to find a iPhone at a fraction of the price of a new one.Many of the reviews made me nervous about making this investment because the phones they received had some problems. Since the seller Hybrid IT had great reviews, I felt better about taking the risk. (To be noted, I initially bought a iPhone 6S from Hybrid IT, but then returned it after deciding to upgrade to an iPhone 8. The return was easy and the seller was helpful!)The phone I received was in great condition, and I had no trouble setting it up with my AT&T SIM card. I've been using it for the last three weeks, and I haven't run into any issues.There are a few things to add, the phone came with a generic charging cord with a wall plug-in. It did not come with headphones, so if you are buying an iPhone 8, you'll have to buy Bluetooth headphones or Earpods with the lightning connector, which are about $29 on the Apple site. Finally, the battery health is at 84% according to my phone, which is expected with a refurbished phone. It does last me through the day, but something to note if you are in the market. I hope this helps!

  This phone was for a family member - their 6s was on its last leg, but they didn’t require the latest technology (or the price tag that goes with it). I’m glad I took a chance on the refurb - the phone works great! It looked new when I took it out of the box, and I had no issues with swapping out the SIM card from the old phone and getting it up and running. A great buy!

    Mine was not an AT&T phone
  
",1.0,Mindy,"Reviewed in the United States August 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  I used the phone with AT&T for about nine months. It worked well. When I asked AT&T to unlock the phone so I could use it with another carrier, AT&T had no record of the phone I received from this seller. Thus, unless I use this phone is used only with AT&T, the phone is useless going forward.Phones advertised as AT&T carrier phones should fall under the general rules and conditions of what it means to have phones locked to that carrier. AT&T can unlock phones that are originally locked to them. Apparently, mine works with AT&T (described as ""partially unlocked"" by AT&T reps) but cannot be unlocked unless the original carrier is identified. This seller said it's AT&T; AT&T says it's not AT&T.Should it really fall to me, the consumer, who believes ""Apple iPhone 8, 64GB, Gold - For AT&T"" means the phone is registered to AT&T -- to resolve this issue? A consumer can't unlock a phone. Only a carrier can.

  This product came in good shape but with a completely bad battery. The phone would work until you got to around 50% and the. Would randomly shut off! I had to buy a battery 1 day after I received it and it cost me another $70.00... I bought the 2 year warrant and paid an extra $70.00 for that! I use my phone for business and don’t have time to send it in for warranty so I just paid outta pocket to prevent the inconvenience. I am always worried about buying used things online for this exact reason. With that said the phone works perfect after the new battery was installed. I will be very reluctant to buy used electronics online in the future. (Which was my gut feeling in the first place!!)

  Alright so I wanted to give it some time before I wrote a review on our phone (in case we came across any problems with it). Fortunately, we’ve had our IPhone 8 since December now it’s January and have had zero problems with it. The phone actually came in pristine condition, no scratches or blown out/distorted speaker or any other problems! I do see that there’s others here that, sadly, have problems with their phone from the minute they receive it and I think it has a lot to do with the seller. Before I purchased our phone I checked the different sellers and ratings/reviews and ultimately we went with Hybrid IT. Take a look for yourselves, I strongly recommend this seller for anyone looking to get one of these phones!

  This phone arrived and appeared as described--like new.  Easily accepted our carrier SIM and worked great....for 6 weeks.  Yesterday the phone suddenly died.  I reached out to amazon and they connected us with Apple.  They tried in vain for an hour to get it working again but couldn't.  Ultimately Amazon accepted it to return (it had the 90 renewed guarantee) and off it went by UPS today.We've had good luck with renewed items and this may have just been a fluke.  But we decided to buy a brand new Apple Xr phone instead.

  Its honestly a great phone, and it works well. Everything about it is fine, it still has 89% battery capacity, the cameras are great, its very fast. The only problem is that when I got it the phone was still locked onto another carrier. My carrier is Metro PCS and they told me that I would have to talk to the seller and get them to actually unlock the phone because it's still locked onto another account. This is very frustrating. Hopefully I can return the phone and actually get it unlocked soon.

  It came a couple of days before it was expected to which was great. Opened the box and it was just the phone and a charger like advertised. I’m very surprised at the look of it. The phone looks like it’s brand new. It works very great. It is unlocked and was easy just to pop in my sim from my iPhone 6s into this iPhone 8. I upgraded from the 6s to the 8 because I have had the 6s for 5 years now and never gotten it cracked or broken or anything and it works fine but in the last couple of weeks to a month now it seems like the 6s battery isn’t lasting as long after a charge so instead of finding a place to try to get it replace for god knows how much I figured it was time to upgrade my phone and now I’m glad I did.

  Despite the basic packaging, I was quite impressed with the condition of the phone, it looked brand new without a single scratch, which was one of my main concerns, when purchasing a refurbished phone. It also came with nicely packaged; headphones, aux adapter cable, and a charger. What I like the most about this purchase, was the fact that it was SIM unlocked(read some reviews saying it wasn’t). I was able to insert my AT&T SIM card and have it work immediately without any complications, I was able to call/text people within minutes of activating the phone. I’ve only had this phone for a week now and so far nothing seems to raise any red flags yet, I’ll update my review if anything changes.

  I bought this phone to replace a cheap Galaxy J3V which ran out of storage space after a few videos (16 gig vs 256 gig).  I saw the Iphone had a different size SIM than the Galaxy so I ordered a new SIM from Verizon at no cost and got it one day after I got the phone.  I charged the Iphone for several hours and started the activation.  Wouldn't activate and I talked to 4 or 5 Verizon people over two days (and long waits for a tech).  The last guy said he could see the phone and the SIM on his system but there must be something wrong with the phone, so I sent it back and said I would try another (the people at KISS were nice and got me a different phone).  Both phones were in excellent shape and the second one had a nice screen protector already installed.  Guess what?  Still wouldn't activate.  After over an hour wait on Dec 26, the Verizon tech said I needed to get a strong signal from a tower instead of a wifi signal.  This immediately made sense to me (why didn't the other Verizon techs figure this out?)  After a seven mile trip to a parking lot near a tower, the phone activated in about 15 seconds.  Amazing, right?  Not exactly.  I got back home and couldn't do anything over wifi.  The next morning I got to speak to a tech  right away but no solution.  The next level tech told me he also lived outside of cell area and used wifi and knew the problem.  Guess what, I had to go back to the tower to get a strong LTE signal to activate wifi.  The phone works fine now and I'm very happy with it.  KISS gets good marks and Verizon needs to know some people don't have cell service at their home.

",1.0,Sean Rose,"Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  It's definitely ""buyer beware"" when buying a ""renewed"" iPhone from Verizon -- because Verizon's iPhones are not truly renewed.  The last two that I have purchased from Verizon have had their battery health levels fall below 80 within three (3) weeks, and two (2) months, respectively.  One of the two displayed a ""battery significantly degraded"" message.  What a waste of my time and Amazon's refund, shipping, and return expenses.  Suggestion for Verizon:  why don't you focus your efforts on selling iPhones that have acceptable levels of battery health?  #NeverAgainfromVerizon

  I received my two phones in two days a stated with amazon prime. Phone looked really good to be refurbished. Normal scratches not too noticeable nothing too bad cosmetics wise. Came with a charger and block piece; comes inside small amazon boxes wrapped in bubble wrap for extra protection. I had no problem logging into my iCloud. I switched carriers from sprint to metro which was the reason for purchase. CDMA and GSM are completely different. The phones worked just fine . The IMEI was clear and was not on the blacklist. SIM cards were activated and put in and within 45 I had new service with these phones. I did take them to the store and let the rep put in the SIM cards. Though only been active for 24 hours on these phones. No complaint so far only that the battery does not hold a charge like a newer phone might . So keep a charger near, especially if you use your phone a lot during the day. Overall I’ll say 4.5/5 I’m very satisfied for the price I paid.

  We purchased two of these phones. One arrived with an LCD bleed, which at least allowed us to see the problem early enough to send it back in time for a refund. Please note that the problem was clearly visible as soon as the phone was turned on. It should have never been resold this way. The second phone would occasionally not connect to cellular data, a problem that got worse over time until it eventually stopped making and receiving calls altogether.I cannot stress enough the frustration you will likely feel at buying a ""refurbished"" phone that has seemingly not undergone any refurbishing. I'm sure others have had better luck of the draw, but there doesn't seem to be any quality control on what's being sent out. It is a waste of money and time, and you are better off not purchasing here.

    Cell Phones And Ladies

  Cell phones are like ladies. When they are young and fresh, you can't wait to play with it. You show it to your friends, take it everywhere, have some amazing times and great memories.Time marches onward and technologies advance. Suddenly your cell phone is old and tired. Once the envy of your friends, it's now a joke. You finally turn it in.Then there are those who buy a refurbished phone. Like a MILF, the phone can still provide some good times but you are only kidding yourself. The best days are gone and you will only be frustrated when it breaks down and becomes nothing more than a pain in your ass.Both phones I received were worn out. The first phone's camera did not work and the replacement was DOA. It's best to buy a new cell phone and not waste your time buying refurbished junk.

I am going back to Samsung as soon as possible. 😕

  When I first received this phone it was surprisingly in good shape. The problem started after I put in my SIM card and transferred everything from my previous phone... although I put the SIM card in this new phone it would constantly say “no SIM card” which meant I also didn’t have any service and it did this a couple of times and it annoyed me.... a way that I would resolve it each time is that I would turn the phone off completely and then turn it back on and it worked temporarily until recently when I did it for the last time and it hasn’t showed that for a couple of days now. Another problem that I recently started having with this phone is that I just now noticed that it stopped charging past 80% ... No matter how long it is plugged in for it doesn’t charge higher than 80% anymore and I am so annoyed with this phone... with these troubles that I am having already I might as well just go to apple and get one of theirs , but everything else seems to be working fine but I have a feeling that when it approaches the Amazon return deadline that I’m sure I will encounter more problems.

But, when I took it to Apple, they couldn’t replace the battery. They showed me pictures, where there was standing water and corrosion inside. Needless to say, I was shocked. Not only did I have the phone in a waterproof case, I only had it for a few days, and NEVER had it near water. I immediately contacted Amazon, who contacted the seller. The seller asked if I’d submerged the phone. I couldn’t believe it. After a few days of emailing, they agreed to a refund. I asked for a different phone with a full capacity battery as compensation. I use the phone for work. I missed out on money. They said they couldn’t oblige that. But, they did refund me promptly after reviewing the water damaged phone.

",2.0,JenP,"Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  I love the iPhone 8 itself (I got one on release; this one was meant to replace a larger screen phone that I couldn’t get used to), but unfortunately this “renewed” phone wasn’t up to par. The description says minimal to no visible wear; however, the inch long gouge smack in the middle of the screen says otherwise. There are tons of micro-scratches all over the screen visible when held at an angle to light, but the gouge is way too distracting and obvious all the time (screen on or off, even looking straight on) so unfortunately I had to return it. I should have known the price was too good to be true.

Whenever I'm on a call I can barely hear the person on the other end but they can hear me clearly and there is an echo sometimes when I'm talking. It has a few scratch.

  I returned it because I'm used to the size of an iPhone 7 plus, but the phone was flawless. It even came with the sticker on the screen, like it was brand new. The packaging left nothing to be desired, it was 256GB as advertised and gave no problems. I just forgot to notice that it was an 8 and not an 8 plus, but that's on me. The product still deserves five stars.

  I had to get a new battery for this phone becaue it would not stay on. The phone was out of warrany and I do not expect the seller to repair this becaue I did not purchase the extended warranty. When I took the phone to get a new battery they siad its missing parts and the battery is just flopping around. It had one screw holding the internal parts in. The company said they will not work on it because it was so badly refrubished that I will have continual issues with it. I contacted the seller to try and reslove the issue but they have not contaced me back. I am stuck with a dead phone that is useless. AVOID THIS SELLER!!!

  Really nice... It seems a brand new iPhone 8, out of the box.  At first, I wasn't sure whether I should buy or not because of there are a lot of negative reviews for this particular phone along with its seller (vendor).  Thus far, I have no issue with the iPhone 8.  Of course, all consumers would be so cautious when he/she is looking for a refurbished/used phone.  If I were to pick one minor thing that this phone should have is that ""No place for an ear-pieces.""  Other than this particular one is missing, I would highly recommend to others to consider if you're looking for a refurbished iPhone.

  Received my iPhone within a few days of ordering it.  There is not a scratch or mark on it anywhere.  It presents as new.  Had to take it to the Sprint store to get a SIM card since the one in my old iPhone 5s wouldn't work.  They had it up and running in a matter of minutes.  Called Sprint to see if I could get the phone unlocked.  Again, in a matter of minutes they had that done.  So, now I have a perfect iPhone 8, unlocked and performing flawlessly on the Sprint system.  With it now being unlocked  I can transfer to any other CDMA carrier that I choose.  Battery capacity is 95% which is excellent.  Fingerprint reader works perfectly.  Just purchased another one of these for my wife.

My daughter was able to plug it up and we took it to the be official registred with our phone carrier. Phone didn't hold a charge long, but we thought this was due to the phone needing to be charged (just arrived that day).  BY THE NEXT DAY we realized that the phone would not stay on without being on the charger. Tried another iphone charger (not the one that came with the phone), phone stayed on while off the charger, until you pressed the screen - INSTANTLY CUT OFF.  Took it to the Apple store for what I thought might be a battery replacement, but after diagnostics the problem is the device won't power on the LOGIC BOARD (BRAIN), so the device simply won't power on correctly. Recommends new phone...WTF!Now I have to send this back for a refund...there is no way that this company couldn't have known this if Apple picked up on it in 20 minutes.

  I purchased this iPhone 8 (with the Renewed Premium Guarantee) for my daughter.  It arrived in excellent condition.  However, the first day she had it, the phone would crash and restart when the battery reached about 40%.  This happened again over the next couple days.  I went into the battery settings (see attached screen shot) and found that the battery was seriously degraded, even though it was supposed to be in ""similar to new"" condition with a guaranteed capacity of at least 90%.  So I called Amazon Customer Support for a replacement phone.  It was a cumbersome process.  The Amazon representative had to contact Apple, and he and I were on hold with Apple for about 20 minutes.  When the Apple representative got on the line, the Amazon rep left the call.  The Apple rep remotely ran battery diagnostics and confirmed that the battery was failing.  She then told me the phone was out of warranty and wanted to quote out-of-warranty pricing to me for a new battery.  I objected, stating that Amazon was guaranteeing this phone for a year and wondering why I had to pay for anything at this point.  She then had to talk with her manager, and again I was on hold for several minutes.  She came back and said that I would have to talk with Amazon about the phone.  So I took the case number she gave and called Amazon back.  I was on hold again for a few minutes with Amazon, but when the customer service rep came on the line, I explained the scenario and she took care of the replacement immediately.  I received the new phone the next day.  It arrived in excellent condition and thus far seems to be working perfectly.  Everyone I talked to, both at Amazon and at Apple, was very nice and easy to deal with, it just took a lot of my time to resolve the problem.  All told, I was on the phone for about an hour and five minutes just to get the phone replaced.  I am satisfied with the replacement, I just wish the process would have taken less time.

  The phone I purchased proved to be unusable as it was stolen and blacklisted from network use. When I contacted support, they simply did not acknowledge that the phone was stolen, and after three days simply asked if I'd received shipping labels to send it back, which I took as a tacit admission that they are well aware many of their renewed phones are from unscrupulous sources. I never actually received the shipping labels to send it back anyways.  I strongly advise anyone reading this review to head over to another seller because this one has not proven very dependable, at least for me. Hopefully in the future Kiss Electronics can find a way to take better care of their future customers than I was taken care of, because this transaction could hardly have gone more wrong for me and I'm incredibly disappointed.

  I have a love hate relationship with Apple. I will not buy a new product from them ever. Why? They brick phones with updates. That's shady. They smile while they do it too. So? Well it matters because that makes me a repeat customer of these second hand phones. Prices seem to be set competitively so that doesn't affect my choice of where my cash goes. What does have some weight in my decision making is customer service. I pay the asking price I get a device as advertised. Simple enough right? You would be surprised or maybe you wouldn't. The local places offering these devices have people behind the counters that don't seem to get what good customer service is. So.... okay. Get to the point right? I got a phone that works as advertised at a good price and I didn't have to deal with anyone so that's a plus. However, the appearance of the item was ummm .... acceptable had they not been sloppy in a weak attempt to cover up a blemish on the surface of the screen with a very cheap slapped on at the last second screen protector. The peeled backing of the protector was discarded into the corner of the box looking confused and I'm sure feeling slightly used.Have I mentioned it prior to this post? Nope. It really wouldn't matter had it not been so obvious of a weak attempt to cover something that wasn't as expected. Customer Service guys. Don't just don't. Will I buy another when the time comes? Yup. Whatta ya do? Smile and count your blessings these days I guess. It could always be worse.

",3.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  So far I’m happy with my new iPhone 8, with one exception: it came with a non-compatible charger. How am I supposed to charge up a brand new phone with the wrong charger? Good thing I had my existing iPhone 6 charger. My point is, if they say they’re going to send you a compatible charger, then send one! Then I found out the hard way that my Sim card in my iPhone 6 is not compatible with my iPhone 8, and this phone did not come with a Sim card. I suggest you read the product description thoroughly before you decide to purchase!

  There were a few small blemishes on the back of the phone that were only noticeable if you look really close.  Otherwise no scratches, dent, or anything else customers mentioned on either of the two phones that I ordered.  It came with a real Apple charger not a knockoff and the phone itself worked perfectly.  I saved $200 over buying a new phone and am super happy.

    COMPANY LIED IN THEIR ADVERTISING - PHONE WAS NOT FOR VERIZON AS ADVERTISED!!
  
",2.0,Larry,"Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  (I bought this for my son to be placed on my current VERIZON network plan) ...so..ok, let me start by saying that i received the phone via 2-day Prime shipping. Phone came in a generic box, but sufficient for transport. It included the charger and 3ft charging cable. nothing else. Unboxed, the phone was in EXCELLENT cosmetic condition, not a single scratch anywhere. I powered it on, the display was beautiful and worked as it should. At that point I ran thru the setup and got the phone all setup for my son (its his b-day present) ... then I took the phone to VERIZON STORE and had them put a VERIZON SIM in it for activation and to be added to my current verizon plan ....WELL GUESS WHAT... this phone is a model A1905, and it is ONLY GSM carrier compatible, NOT CDMA, which is what verizon is.... but yet, this phone was advertised as "" FOR VERIZON"" , which is the ONLY reason I went ahead and bought it. The Verizon models are A1863 & A1864. So I have given the review 2 stars because of the great cosmetic, great camera and fully functional condition , but because they LIED, and DID NOT send me what I purchased (a phone for VERIZON networks), I do feel that this is unacceptable that tey are allowed to Advertise one thing, then send you another. Where I come from we call that a big fat LIE!!! and I DO NOT put up with LIARS, therefore I  reporting themfor FALSE ADVERTISEMENT and hopefully they will be kicked off of AMAZON

  As expected, the battery was not at 100% capacity but it was higher than expected at 89%.There’s practically no scratches on the back or front of the phone and everything seems to be in excellent working order.I did not expect a charger or screen protector to come with the purchase but it did! The screen protector was already in place so I didn’t have to use the one I bought and I will be saving the charger the phone arrived with in case I need it later.This was listed as a FULLY UNLOCKED iPhone and I believe it has arrived as such, it will definitely work for the carrier I initially intended, which is Cricket.I believe my little sister has a step up from this phone (the 8 Plus) and she’s still paying for her phone through the provider. I’ve never bought a refurbished phone before this so I’m glad it worked out, if anything happens within the next 90 days before the Amazon warranty expires I’ll be sure to update. Definitely would buy the protection plan in addition to the phone, as accidents do happen.

    Worst iPhone Ever

  Siri does not work and causes serious crashes.  I can use the Home button for anything but Siri.  When I use it for voice text or reminders, the phone will do one function and then go into vapor lock, requiring several reboots and a timeout (power down) for at least 10 minutes to work again.  In the past I depended on Siri a lot, so it has been a big problem. And then I missed my 90-day guarantee window to get the problem resolved.  Know why?  Because I didn't have Siri to remind me to get it done in time.  This has been a sad waste of $300.

  I have never left a bad review.  We own two businesses and I get the impact that reviews could have on a company.  It came with a charger and that charger is the only charger the phone worked on.  My 15 year old daughter saved ALL year for this $397 iphone 8.  It lasted 3.5 months.  We went on vacation and she forgot her charger.  By the way, it was still in warranty when we left for vacation.  Her phone would not work with any other iphone charger that we had.  I do not know much about the mechanical part of phones other than how to operate them. We went to a technician on vacation thinking it was the battery. Battery was fine, charge port was fine.  He said the chip was bad on the mother board and to fix it would be significant.  The technician said the seller KNEW this phone had a problem and sold it anyway.  Amazon contacted seller. Seller emailed me it's 2 weeks out of warranty go to a repair shop.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.  ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.

  I was hesitant to order bc of how long it said it would take to arrive, however it arrived in less than a week (a whole week earlier than expected). I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the phone. Not one single scratch on the screen, rear glass surface, or camera lens. There were some small surface scratches on the paint close to the camera lens, but that is to be expected with a refurbished phone. Other than that, it was in perfect condition. It is fully operational, and took the AT&T SIM card that I had when I first tried it. Where I’m located, Verizon is the way to go bc AT&T service sucks around here. When my Verizon sim arrived from straight talk, I popped it in and called the customer service line. She worked her magic and paired the phone’s IME number with the Verizon sim, and after about 20 minutes it was working perfectly on the Verizon sim. So when they say all carriers, it actually works on both AT&T and Verizon carriers.Also, I wasn’t even expecting a new cord and charger, but there it was in the box. I was also expecting to have to go find a paperclip to install my sim, but low and behold they included the sim removal tool too! For a 256Gb phone that is unlocked on all carriers, I’m extremely impressed. The battery had about 80% capacity, which is great too.I’m excited to have a shiny new phone, and I didn’t have to pay an arm and a leg to one of the big cell companies or sign and contract to get it! I’m all about not signing cell contracts these days. So thank you for having great quality phones for purchase! I will purchase from them again in the near future when it’s time for me to upgrade once again

  I ordered 2 iPhone 8's from this vendor at a good price.The phones I received work well, but after using them a while we discovered that we were unable to disable the rather loud camera shutter sound.  This is apparently a ""feature"" of Japanese market iPhones due to local laws.  Sure enough, when we find the Model code in the settings, these are Japanese models, even though we are in the U.S.There was no indication that we would receive foreign model phones in the listing, nor how they may differ from US distributed phones.  The listing indicates that the phones are ""For AT&T"", which I believe is a U.S. only network provider.This is somewhat annoying.

  This was supposed to be an upgrade over my Samsung j2. The phone runs smooth, the camera and the speakers are a slight upgrade. However, the user interface annoys me. (this isn’t my first iPhone) The whole Bluetooth headphones is a lesser experience and finally the battery. This phone dies in 3.5 hours. It’s incredibly inconvenient and a little stressful. I think it’s just the quality the provider sold me. It says in the battery menu that the phone can only hold 69% of the maximum charge. I am for sure not giving Apple another $50 to change the battery to make it slightly better. Once again, who would pay almost $200 for a phone that dies in 3.5 hours? Very poor quality. I will gladly keep my old phone and take my money back. Update: within the first 24 hours it randomly turned off and when I turned it back on I had to reboot it to get service back.

",1.0,Alisha  Cunningham,"Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2019","









  
  
    
  iPhone came locked. We took it to T-Mobile who couldn’t do anything for us. We then took it to Apple, who offered to bypass the code. As they were working to bypass, the phone wouldn’t connect to the USB port. The Apple genius takes out a cleaner and starts unpacking gunk from the charging port. So, that was the moment I decided that we were sending this back. It was locked, it was packed with lint, it would not charge, and it has a visible scratch. So much for careful refurbishing.

    Terrible Battery Life and touch screen
  
",1.0,Ben Pham,"Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  Bought this renewal product as a gift. It came in 2 days (Nov 16 to Nov 18) but item is not as the description. It was advertised as battery exceed 80% (This product will have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new) but it was exactly at 80% which means I have to replace a new battery eventually which costs another $80-$100. The screen freezes off a lot of time and one one point, only the home button works. I have to do hard reset to make it coming back to usual. Trying to call customer services but no one available, emailing them is no help. I regret to buy this. Now I have to take time to return plus I need to find a different one in 2 days. Horrible experience

  This phone works great refurbished, the only complaint is the battery life (only 80% max left after its original use).

    Great Refurbished iPhone 8 from TRADEMORE.
  
",5.0,Lay,"Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2021","









  
  
    
  Purchased two rose gold iPhone 8’s from the company TRADEMORE. The phones arrived in two days and in great condition. Everything seems to work as it should including the cameras, speaker, microphone, and touchscreen. The battery health is above 80% on both phones; which is great for a used/refurbished phone. There is no cosmetic damage to be noted, and all functions worked upon installing my SIM card.TRADEMORE sends the phones in their own packaging and includes a Verizon wall pack with an 8 ft usb to lightning cable. Inside the packaging included a flyer that ensures a 90 day warranty. I’m pleased with the phones and would buy from this company again.

  The sim card tray was extremely hard to get out.  Then I realized my phone came in with 84% battery life.  I didn’t realize that a battery should be replaced at 80 percent.

Your phone could come almost needed a replaced battery.My sister bought a refurbished phone from Amazon from another seller for around the same price and her battery life is 98%.

  First time buying a refurb phone. Daughter needed a replacement for her old one that looked as if someone had taken a sledge hammer to it. How does a phone get like that? Works great. Delivered with a good battery. It was at or very near 100% life. No dings or scratches. With 256GB of storage I will never hear again about running out of storage. Came with used protective glass installed which had a few chips in the corner but no big deal. Have not got to it yet, but easily replaced. Also bought a silicome cover and replacement glass. 9 months, so far, so good. Could have saved an extra $60 if I had waited until after the Christmas season.

  This phone is fantastic. My 12yr old really wanted an iPhone and we weren't going to pay Apple prices for one. It arrived in great condition and looked brand new.She has had it for around a month now, so I feel more confident leaving a review. We have had no issues with it whatsoever. Battery life could be better.The phone came with a charging cable that didn't work and seller was very quick to send a replacement out to us.  Great purchase so far.

    PHONE'S IMEI NUMBER BLACKLISTED AS LOST/STOLEN
  
",1.0,D. Miller,"Reviewed in the United States February 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  The phone initially worked just fine and I was able to make a few phone calls after getting a sim card from my carrier. A few hours later, however, I realized I wasn't getting authentication text messages while trying to set up social media apps. While trying to make a test phone call, I was redirected to my carrier's customer service line. The representative informed me that the phone's IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number had been blacklisted as lost/stolen and that I would be unable to use the device until it had been removed from the blacklist by either Apple or Verizon (the former carrier). This is unacceptable considering I paid for a fully unlocked phone. On top of that, the headset speaker sounds tinny as if it was damaged from playing music too loudly. Phone calls are nearly unintelligible and music quality sounds worse than my iPhone 5s. I am very disappointed overall with this ""Renewed"" product that Amazon stands behind.

",4.0,Brian Metcalf,"Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  I specifically sought this US-based model number A1863: it is listed as such.  Awesome.  I instead received a Japanese version model A1902 (apple p/n MQ782J/A).  Did you know that the Japanese model doesn't allow the user to silence the shutter sound effect when taking pictures, or the beeps when starting or stopping video recording?  After some embarrassment in front of clients at job site surveys, I researched the model number and learned why it was happening.  I ended up downloading a non-Apple camera app, in order to avoid the sound effects.  If I was sent the A1863 model as listed, this issue would not have cropped up.  That is why I am taking off one star from this review.To the seller's credit, the phone arrived a day early, was packaged well, and was in excellent physical shape.  All I had to do was put my SIM card in it, and load in everything from my iTunes account.  I've had it for several weeks, with no hiccups.AppleCare coverage was obviously expired and the battery reported its maximum health as 88%, but this is obviously a used phone.  Still a good value for me.

  This phone quit working properly right after the 90 days return window. When attempting to talk to someone on phone, you can hear the other person but they cannot hear you. This is not a problem with other person’s phone because it happens on every incoming and outgoing call made from this phone. In all fairness, there are no problems with texting, games, etc. but the main purpose of a phone for me is to make or receive calls. This is not an occasional problem, it is every phone call made or received. Also, I did not drop phone, get it in water, or do anything to damage phone. The phone has been in an Otterbox Defender since the day I got it.

  I upgraded from an iphone 6, to an iphone 8 after the announcement of the iphone 11 price drop, because with ios13 they finally stopped supporting the 6. All I do on my phone is check email, chat on telegram, take photos and watch youtube. I'm not a power user, so the main difference I noticed was everything became more responsive, faster, and the battery lasts much longer. The transfer process was pretty easy through itunes. No complaints, I stuck with apple out of sheer convenience, and I'll probably continue to stay with apple as long as they don't remove the fingerprint reader in future models.

I figured it's backed by Amazon with their 90 day warranty too. I don't play games or watch movies or any of those things so I didn't need to get the newest Iphone that's out there. My old one had 16GB this one has 64, so I'm getting 3 times what I had. I like the smaller size too which is another reason why I got the 8. They do ship it in a generic box with a generic charger.  The charger lasted 4 days and broke, good thing my old charger works on it. I've only had it for a week but so far, so good. I will update my review after I've had the phone longer.

    Risk Paid Off -- Take the Plunge, People--Also, Buy a Protective Case
  
",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  I almost never write reviews--I think it's worth doing so here.  Many of them here scared me.  But, given that it was half the price of what my mobile carrier sold, I took the plunge and bought the product.  I waited with morbid curiosity for it to arrive after seeing all of the negative reviews here.  It arrived several days early and had one very small crack on the bottom left-hand corner that I really had to spend some time looking for to see why on earth it needed refurbished in the first place.  Within 48 hours, I made a larger blemish to the poor R2D2 when I dropped it screen-side-down on my hard floors in my apartment  Luckily, the relatively small cracked section that my spectacular feat of juggling awesomeness caused didn't affect the visible part of the screen and added my own personal touch to the party,  I guess, so the disaster mostly was avoided.  This experience made me come to terms with the fact that it's only a matter of time before this device accidentally ends up in my commode.  Pro Tip: I highly recommend ordering a case as soon as you order this so you don't end up like me.The iPhone has no issues whatsoever absent its operator, who is a darned klutz that never should be allowed to handle electronics absent close adult supervision.  In all seriousness, I am thrilled with this purchase  Apple designed them to be slippery.  See that you buy a screen protector.

It came with it's charger, except earphones. I'm sure my mom will love this phone for her birthday gift!

  UPDATE Feb. 2021  -- one year later -- the charging function of the charger cord stopped working now.. made a grave error buying this phone from whoever used amazon to sell their messed-up item. no good, no good!The ""generic' charger / data carrier cable they added to it was not good for transferring files or photos from phone to laptop. It did not work at all. It did do the charging part of its job though -- but only when attached to the electrical outlet in the wall but definitely not when i needed to charge the phone via laptop

  I bought this phone for my mom who was maxing out her storage on her iPhone 6. The phone works fine (a lot better then an 6). The charger provided in the box didn’t work and the screen wasn’t completely flush with the case but that isn’t a problem. The phone also had a couple of dirt marks on it but after a wipe they can right off. Additionally, the phone said that the battery health was at 100%. Overall I would recommend this phone and there was no major problems.

  I like this, but I think I should have gone with the 8 plus, this thing is tiny in my hand.  One thing I'm not a fan of is that Apple seems to have taken away the ability to make my own custom ringtones for the thing.  It's one of two things that makes me keep thinking of going to android, but I have bought so much music, TV shows, and movies on iTunes, that the idea of doing it is a bit daunting.

  Dislikes:1. Because this was a refurbished unit, the battery life is not that of a new phone.2. The Wi-Fi hotspot loses connectivity - at times it is better to is the Bluetooth connection, which eats more data.3. I came from android, so the inability to put widgets on any multiple screens is disappointing. This makes the ""Home Screen"", which is the only place you can put widgets, useless. I want my weather widget on top of my most used apps on the first page of my phone. Apple offers very limited widgets. Most apps do not have one.4. There is a glitch in the iPhone 8 that causes it to very frequently turn the volume all the way down at random times.Likes:1. Not requiring anti-virus is nice.2. Siri is worlds better than Google Assist. (waiting for some developments that would allow additional voice activated options, like ""Siri, read me the content of website xyz"", etc.). Siri is the main reason I switched from android. It is awesome!!!

  I am a 12 year old girl, and I payed my own money for this phone. It came in the mail on the last day that it said it would, so kind of on time. The only cosmetic problem is that the outer ring of the camera is a bit scratched, but you can hardly see it. The touch screen works perfectly. The fingerprint reader doesn’t read your finger when your hands are sweaty, but that is the only time. I put in my left thumb, right thumb, left pointer, and right pointer into the thing and all of them work 99% of the time. The battery life is good, but I leave it on dark mode, True Tone off, and I always like to keep the brightness down. The phone adapts to the brightness of your surroundings, and so if you’re in a dark room, it goes dark and vice versa. Overall the phone is great, and I definitely recommend it, especially for the price. I hope that this review is helpful.

It came the next day after I ordered it and I only needed to put my SIM card from my iPhone 6 into the new iPhone 8 and it connected right to the network. I didn’t have to go in the store or call a number or anything. Wonderful phone upgrade. It’s much better than the old one. Would recommend to anyone looking to upgrade a Verizon prepaid phone.

  The camera sound (the “click” when you take a picture) cannot be muted, not even if you switch off the sound with the button on the left side and you activate the Silent Mode. I went to the Apple store to verify if it was a hardware issue and it could be repaired, but they said no: they informed me that this is not adjustable as the phone comes from Japan and this is one of those countries where the sound of the camera cannot be silenced. I found it extremely disappointing, as I would have never bought it if I knew in advance – and I am very surprised that this is an Amazon “certified and inspected product”: did not you realize while inspecting the phone that the camera sound could not be muted? At least you could have advised that in this particular device the sound could not be turned off.As a loyal customer of Amazon (Prime too) from several years now, I found it extremely shady: you sponsor a product as certified and tested by Amazon-qualified supplier and you should be transparent while describing the product and its specifications, given that Amazon is an international platform and your buyers are based all around the world. I am based in the USA and knowing that the product would have come from Japan and the camera cannot be silenced, I wouldn’t have completed the purchase but switched to a different supplier.This is a lack of primary information that should have been disclosed by Amazon and would have guided and helped me in the purchasing process.Lastly, the battery is weak – it lowers down very quickly and I have to charge it at least three times a day.

  Everything about this product has been perfect. The quality was indistinguishable from new, it has functioned reliably and perfectly since I received it. This would have been an easy 5-star review except for one thing:This is a refurb unit from Japan, which means that the camera shutter sound is hardwired in and cannot be muted, turned down, or turned off.That one little thing is enough to make this unit borderline unusable for me, as I primarily (used to!) use my phone camera for wildlife photography on hikes. Now a single exceptionally loud click sends every critter in the vicinity scurrying for cover.

  By reading some other reviews and based on my own experience I feel as though Kanga Supply, probably doesn't do a very intensive quality assurance on their products. If I could guess, they get a lot of refurbished used phones, which for the majority of the time work fine, but there are going to be quite a few phones that are faulty. The phone I received wouldn't even turn on, despite trying to charge it with 3 different chargers. I guess it's my fault for not looking at their website, where they make no guarantees that their products work. If you need a phone immediately, I wouldn't suggest buying from here, unless your willing to wait 3-4 business days for an exchange or refund.

  I gotta be honest I didn't expect to get a damn near perfect iPhone 8.It was sim locked to AT&T but less than 15 minutes after getting an approved unlock from their website and restoring the phone I was able to insert my sim card then use it on the CricketWireless service.There is one small tiny paint blemish on one of the edges but honestly it really isn't a problem because a case would cover it up easily. Other than that the phone has no scratches or dings anywhere else, battery is great, no Cloud lock and everything functions normally.I don't know if I got lucky or people are writing fake reviews but I am very pleased with my purchase and the fact that it comes with a 90 day warranty is a plus.Thank you for blessing me with a phone I could give to my mom cuz she loves having TouchID and having some newer features like wireless charging is a plus too (even though she's never going to use it).

  The phone was beautiful and perfect in great condition! However, the shutter sound would not mute, which meant it was probably from Japan where it is illegal to mute the camera shutter sound.

  I’ve been using this phone for 3 weeks. Calls are so quiet that unless you’re in silent a silent room you can’t hear the call even with the volume turned all the way up. The keyboard occasionally doesn’t pop up- you have to turn the phone off and back on to get the keyboard working, made worse by the fact that it’ll only turn on after being turned off if it’s connected to power even if it’s fully charged. And there’s an annoying feedback noise on the playback of videos made using the front facing camera.So calls, text, and camera are bad. Hopefully Amazon honors the 90 day guarantee because I won’t be able to return it until next week and when I tried to return it to the seller it said that had to return it by tomorrow.

  Leason learned with this one.  I received the phone a couple weeks ago, but waited for my daughter to get home from college for Christmas before activating it.  After she activated it, she was having problems sending messages, etc., so she went to the Verizon store for help.  She was told the serial number for the phone is blacklisted because it has been reported lost or stolen.  When we tried to re-active her old phone, her number had been blocked for fraud associated with the stolen/lost phone.  She and my husband were on the phone with Verizon last night for more than two hours trying to get this mess resolved.  Don't do it.  It's not worth it.  Just get a new phone.

",1.0,Mary Ann Lowe,"Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  I gave this phone a 1 only because the seller is not describing it properly.  It is a gsm phone and, as such, does not work on Verizon or Sprint the same way a Verizon or Sprint phone will work.  Those carriers use CDMA phones, so a gsm phone will not get the same coverage.  It worked in as far as I could get it activated to make calls, receive texts and be fully functional, but only in certain areas.  I had an iPhone6 & an iPhone 4 before that, both with Verizon & both of those worked all the time at my boyfriend's house & never once lost service in 6 years.  Then I bought this phone & had service fine until I got to his house & then my phone said ""no service"".  It did this repeatedly for a few days every time I went to his house & stayed that way the whole time I was there even though my boyfriend's Verizon iPhone 8 worked in the same house at the same time & never lost service.  I called Verizon & they said this phone was a T-Mobile phone & is a gsm phone & explained that if I want the same level of coverage I had before I need an unlocked phone that was originally a Verizon phone so that it is a CDMA phone.  I guess an original Sprint phone would work, too, since those are CDMA phones.  I told Amazon that they need to require the sellers of cell phones to identify the phone as gsm or CDMA.

  I purchased this phone from BuySPRY.  The phone works great, EXCEPT you cannot turn off the sound of the camera shutter.  It is a Japanese model.  In Japan, there is a law that phones must make a sound when taking a photo.  The sound does not play when taking a live photo, but in any app that uses the camera, it will make a sound when taking a still photo even if it is muted.  Quite annoying if you are trying to take a photo of something in a quiet room.

  The phone came as described in awesome packaging (as in, not just a cardboard box). The phone works great, it's fast compared to my iPhone SE, and was nearly flawless cosmetically. It had the signs of good use with a couple of scuffs, but that was covered up by the case I purchased. Besides, cosmetics don't affect the performance of the phone.Something I was a little leery about was the description, so here's my experience: The phone I received was unlocked and works great with Ting. The description said unlocked, but some reviewers mentioned that they received a GSM phone, and I was looking for CDMA. I received a phone that was unlocked that worked on either carrier network. I purchased from BuySPRY. I hope they don't mind I mentioned them.It is my understanding and from my research that unlocked and fully unlocked are roughly the same as carrier unlocked and factory unlocked. However, if the description specifies a specific network like ""unlocked GSM,"" then the phone will only work on GSM networks. Make sure to do your research on the phones before purchasing and contact the seller with questions. That's what I did and it worked out to my benefit.

  I almost returned it after I couldn’t get it to read my SIM card. But after multiple attempts, a tiny piece of metal fell out onto my lap and I attempted once more to insert my SIM card into the phone and it slid right in, where as before it must’ve been being blocked by that tiny piece of metal, and the compartment that holds the SIM card wasn’t being inserted all the way and was actually protruding out of the phone, but it wasn’t that noticeable until i compared it both mine and my sisters iPhone, and those were both flush with the phone. I’m extremely happy with my purchase after that issue was resolved. I ordered the silver case, its white on the back side not silver, but I still like it. With a case on all u can see is the silver Apple and I guess the white makes it stand out, otherwise it doesn’t seem like it would. The circle around the home button is silver though. This may be what they consider silver🤷🏻‍♀️. Regardless I’m happy with everything, works and looks like a brand new phone. If I have any issues I’ll update.

It is a long story but before I bought this phone I bought the same phone from the same seller because I had tried to cancel it because I had failed to get the 0% financing and failed so I returned it ad ordered it again.  had received my refund right away.  So I am happy with the phone and with the seller, BuySPRY.

  Wholly unimpressed with Amazon's 'renewed' service.-- I bought a phone compatible with T-Mobile, but our sims wouldn't work. After an extended support call we found out the phone was locked to a carrier in Japan. It was suggested that I could call them to ask for the phone to be unlocked... yeah no thanks.-- Also: The phone just randomly shuts off. Mid-use, and the phone's screen is black and the button is unresponsive. Nice job at 'renewing'.So whatever 'renewed' means to Amazon, it is not ""refurbished, functioning phone"". Returning it and shopping elsewhere.

I've bought this for my aging mother-in-law that lives far from me. I've had my reservations prior to purchasing it for this simple fact but I thought I'd take a chance and hope the seller would be helpful if something does happen but clearly that's not the case.

I admit that I was a bit nervous about buying the “renewed” device. I took the chance and bought it. The device was in really good shape. These phones are all glass. There wasn’t a scratch on the thing. It is pristine. My own 8plus has been in cases the entire time I’ve owned it and it looks more worn than the 8 I purchased here. There are zero signs of wear on the lightning port . Battery was at 90% health. I updated it to iOS 13 (it had 12) The phone looks and runs as if it were brand new.  I can safely recommend this product and seller.

  [Refurbished iPhone 8/64GB. Bought on Jan. 2021.]As the price difference between iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 settled on a rather negligible sum (~ $20), I reconsidered my decision of buying the former (for ~ $160) and thought it to be wiser to obtain the newer model instead. [1]The phone arrived in an Amazon-iPhone-box; the box contained the phone, a booklet, an iPhone needle, a charging cord and a chord-wall connector (these last two were of different colors and do not appear to be of Apple brand). The box came without any earphones/earbuds – unlike what was testified in some of the earlier reviews.Visually, the phone had no scratches or marks – neither on the screen nor anywhere on its body. The entire exterior appeared to be completely indistinguishable (to a naked eye) from that of a new phone. Fingerprint reader functions slightly worse than expected; because the inconvenience is minor (i.e. several attempts being required before successfully unlocking via fingerprint vs. the usual single successful attempt when using the fingerprint verification method on my old phone), the effect of this issue on my opinion of any given phone is not so significant negligible.Thus far, I have been using this phone for about a month and overall it has been working well. However, for me, one of the most important aspects of a phone is, undoubtedly, its battery life; unfortunately, in the case of this phone, the battery life had been somewhat compromised well before its arrival.For comparison: the peak battery performance of this phone --  iPhone 8/64GB -- is 84% upon ~1-2 days of use after purchase (purchase state: refurbished), whereas the peak battery performance of my old phone -- iPhone 6/32GB – is 94% upon ~ 3 years of use after purchase (purchase state: refurbished).An observation to be tested/confirmed: The phone rapidly loses its battery life upon mildly cold weather conditions -- ~  0 – 5 Celsius or  ~ 32 – 41 Fahrenheit -- despite having a rather thick leather cover on and barely being used. A fully charged battery is completely drained in about an hour or less if used under comparable weather conditions. If left unused, the result seems to improve by approximately halving the battery drainage speed, i.e. approximately “doubling the battery life.”The battery life seems to be affected also by the background app activity (but to a much lesser extent if compared the cold weather conditions); however, it is much trickier (than it may initially seem) to control this parameter: The “Background App Refresh” on/off button in the settings menu does not appear to serve its intended purpose – most of the applications continue to function in the background as it pleases them, and, as far as I can tell – (perhaps even completely) independently of any of the phone settings.On the other hand, considering its refurbished state, as an informed buyer I, admittedly, understand what I had signed up for; so, as sad as it can be, it is hardly surprising to discover most of the cons of this phone to be connected to one of the most significant (for me) aspects of the phone – battery life.Finally, taking into account the affordability of the product, its quality, as well as factoring in its projected short life-span in this rapidly innovating world [2.], I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to all those in search of a new phone. I will try to update my review as new and significant issues come to light.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1.] Although it may be worthy to note here that the two phones at the above-mentioned price-points had different memory capacities, I find it difficult to reconcile that a productive person may use/need 32GB or more memory space in a personal phone; thus, any memory capacity succeeding this number is categorized as “a phone with enough space” and treated similarly in terms of that parameter.[2.] Considering the fact that most of us use any given phone for a very short period of time ( I wouldn’t guess it to be longer than 2-3 years), and considering that this already short time period tends to get even shorter over time – due to innovations happening faster and faster and the pace of the change – the development -- accelerating with an overwhelming rate, a phone that already has seen years worth of usage, represents the yesterday (and thus is soon to be replaced with something way more interesting), and costs the fifth of its initial price while functioning essentially only ~ 15% worse than it used to when it was completely new, in my eyes – is a worthy trade.

  Got this particular phone because it came from Hybrid IT who gets great reviews from others. Phone was in nearly perfect condition, just a few barely noticeable scratches. One negative is the 79% battery, although it’s guaranteed to be at least 80% (hence the 4 stars, not 5). I’ll replace it at some point but still way less expensive than a brand new phone. It came with a charging cord & adapter, screen protector, and a SIM card removal tool. I was able to easily backup the new phone from iCloud and move the SIM card with no problems at all. Very happy so far and hope no issues arise. If they do I’ll come back here with an update.

  It was such a nice relief to receive a renewed phone that looked new, packaged as a new device with vinyl covering on front and back and everything to get my son going.  The customer support was phenomenal!  To be fair, I ran into a small issue with the battery. Battery health was 79% after opening it and using it for 2 weeks...did we check that status before...no.  The seller says it should always be above 80% and will gladly refund, return and replace it or pay for battery replacement if I visit an authorized Apple store.  I chose the easiest for everyone and scheduled a repair and replaced the battery.  Seller not only reimbursed the total amount, it was actually more that the receipt I sent, maybe for my time and effort?  In any case, totally happy with the purchase, completely satisfied with customer service and highly recommend this seller.  Phone looked perfect and still acts 100%, like-new, 3 months later.

  Overall, this phone is great, just as advertised! I use StraightTalk and this phone was easy to switch over. One thing I absolutely HATE and is causing me to return the phone is the shutter sound on the camera. Everything else was as expected, but as in other reviews I see this phone might have originated from a place where the shutter sound is mandatory (see other similar reviews). I am super not a fan of this! It happens on places where the camera is used as well, like Snapchat. Made it really weird when I was taking pictures of my notes in the library. I've tried everything to get it to turn off, but I will be returning this phone and purchasing it directly through my carrier (which is what I was trying to avoid by making this purchase). Would've been PERFECT except this one feature.

    A great phone from a great seller!

  I researched the iPhone 6,7, and 8 as replacements for my aging 5s. I also sought out sellers with good ratings for this purchase. I settled on MyWit based on their reviews and their volume of sales. The phone arrived a day early and it is absolutely pristine. If it is a refurb, there are zero signs of that as there are no marks anywhere on it. Not even finger prints or dust. It came with a nice flex lighting cable and Apple charger (no sim as advertised).I put the sim card from my old iPhone 5s in it and went through the setup questions. I had a fully functional iPhone 8  in 5 minutes tops.  I selected the iPhone 8 over the 6 or 7 due to the advanced technology in the 8. It is worth the extra $100 over the same size 7.  It is fast but the battery lasts all day without showing significant signs of needing a charge.I also purchased a Speck Candy Shell case for this phone. The iPhone 8 has a glass back for wireless charging and it is very smooth and slick to hold. With my dry fingers, it is difficult to even use the phone so a case is necessary to give it some grip. The Speck case is a perfect, anti-slip and lots of drop and screen protection. See this case here https://www.amazon.com/Speck-Products-CandyShell-Phone-iPhone/dp/B01K094IZ8Very pleased with the seller too and I would certainly use them for another phone purchase without question!

  This is the best! My son loved it he was so happy about it! There is no scratches, No dents no nothing. It doesn't look refurbished it looks bran new! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking to buy a phone. Doesn't come with original charger cube but not really affecting how it charges. It charges really fast and runs out really slowly. Price is astonishing.

  So I don't really do reviews but this product legitimately surprised me. I ordered this in doubt, because of all the really bad reviews I saw. I was very scared and didn't want to waste 191.19. I finally bit the bullet and bought this refurbished phone on Thursday. It came on Saturday (earlier than expected) in a regular box (not Apple, but that's ok because it is refurbished).  The packaging was nice, and it was protected. The phone already had a nice screen protector on it, and the phone literally looks new. Like I don't see any cosmetic issues or anything (I'll add photos soon). It was already partially chared. As I was setting it up, I put my sim card in and it said ""Invalid Sim"" (I use AT&T), so I was afraid. I popped the sim card out and put it back in and it worked fine. The battery compacity was 88%, which is great for a refurbished phone. Everything looked and performed fine. I've had this phone for 3 days, so I will update this when it has been longer. So far really great.

    What I like - this is ""like new"" as promised
  
",5.0,Andrew J,"Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  When I bought this used/refurbished phone, I was just happy to get an ""upgrade"" from my ancient IPhone 6; what I needed was something secondhand, affordable and still usable.I was pleasantly surprised to receive this order in a condition like new—even pristine, as promised by seller.In terms of functionality, the sensors and controls feel as though I've bought a new phone. All 256gb was available. The speakers, microphone and display work very well.When I was switching out the sim card from my old IPhone 6, the IPhone 8 started detecting the switch and offered an immediate transfer, without my activating the migration function - very cool. The transfer was so near perfect that the IPhone 8 migrated all my WhatsApp messages, which I was expecting to lose (because I don't use icloud). The migration was near perfect because for some apps or platforms, I needed to type in the initial passwords again (even though they were transferred to and saved on the IPhone 8) - just the slight bother of retyping a few passwords one more time.By the way, I am a Singapore buyer, and this order was routed through an Oregon transshipment facility, before it was shipped to Singapore.What's the takeaway I can offer in this review? Buying a secondhand product could be a lucky draw: there is a chance you may get a dud. In this order, I am happy to say that I got exactly what the seller promised. So here's my 5-star thumbs up!

However, my biggest concern is the battery seems to drain rather quickly -- maybe this is quirk with all Apple phones?  Overall, I am pleased with the phone.

  The phone was great I was a little worried because of the reviews but when i received the phone, it was great. The glass at the back is completely intact, there is 2 small scratches at the front that you can barely even see. The battery life was at 98% so this was an awesome deal for the money. Definitely worth buying

  I needed to replace my old iPhone 5S because of the slow processor speed and not so great camera.  The iPhone 8 was priced right and I'm very happy with it.  The hardest part of the upgrade was getting the sim card tray to open on my old phone.  My previous phone was also a refurbished unit which worked flawlessly for nearly four years.  I've had the new phone for about a week now and there is a lot of new functionality that I have yet to use so it will keep me entertained for a while becoming familiar with them.

  To note: I am obviously returning this product, but will give time for the seller to make things right.  I will change/delete my review if the seller can remedy the situation.To the seller's credit, this phone was delivered much faster than expected, almost a week early.  However, what good is a phone that arrives early if it isn't as advertised.  One of the only guarantees this product comes with is that the battery capacity will exceed 80%.  That's directly from the description from the listing.  Imagine my disappointment when I go to settings and see the message ""Your battery's health is significantly degraded..."" ""Maximum Capacity: 76%"".  This is worse than the iPhone 8 I currently have and was trying to ""upgrade"", and keep in mind I had my current iPhone 8 for about 4 years now.  Completely unacceptable.If even after all that, you still decide to purchase one of these, I should also mention, if you look close enough, you can tell you bought a used phone.  This isn't to knock the seller or the product, it's clear you're not getting a new product, just shows minor signs of wear and tear.

  The phone arrived in great condition. No visible scratches and everything seems to work. Very pleased with the fit and finish. The battery health reads 79% after a few days of use, when I thought to check it. Entirely possible the vendor shipped it with 80% remaining.I am replacing an Xr, and I have to say I forgot how limited my last iPhone 8’s battery capacity was when it gave up the ghost. If you are replacing an iPhone 8 this may not be a big deal, but I’m going to have to charge multiple times a day if I talk for any amount of time. Just keep charges around your home, office, and vehicles and this shouldn’t be a problem. I feel that was the one trade off I made with a refreshed unit-battery life.

  The touch screen of the mobile phone is not sensitive, especially in the four corners. It takes many times to press it to get a response. The sound of the microphone and receiver sometimes is very small, and sometimes it is difficult for the other party to hear clearly when making a call. Sometimes works, so this phone is not stable.

  I bought a used iphone 8 and it was amazon certified. I opened it and saw no scratches or any damage whatsoever. I wanted to use it for a while before I did a review. I have had it about a month now and I havent had any issues at all with the phone's performance. Battery lasts a long time, no dropped calls and fast internet connection regardless of wifi/no wifi.I was so leery about getting a used phone. I've always gone new. When I saw it was only $200, it's worth a shot vs spending $800 on a new phone again. They gave me a 90 day return policy as well for the piece of mind. So far, this was the best bang-for-buck deal rather than buying a new phone. As long as I dont have any issues in the near future, I will continue to buy used phones from Amazon that are certified.

  I usually seek refurbished products as it is a good way to get quality devices at slightly lower costs than buying them new. I found this listing and I will admit that I was a little skeptical about making the purchase because of how few reviews there were. I contacted the seller and asked if there was any way that I could be assured that this would be a good purchase. They were very polite and gave me all of the info on the warranties provided by both them and Apple.I received the product and it was in MINT condition. The phone had absolutely no sign of ware whatsoever. It has been working perfectly for 4 months now, and I could not be happier with my purchase.The packaging clearly wasn't original and the charger was not OEM, but this is stated in the product description so I knew what I was getting into. No big deal.If you're the type of person that is willing to give up a fancy unboxing experience to save about $100, this is an excellent option for you.Additionally, I had no problems switching this phone over on my Verizon account. As long as you are a Verizon customer, this should be an easy process through the Verizon app.Thanks!

  So far I think I like Android phones better than iPhone, but this phone operates and looks like new. The iOS seems counter intuitive; maybe I'll grow to love it. What I do like is that it doesn't deplete its battery like an Android. Seems like a high quality phone, and not as pricey as new.After several months of use, I like the device very much. It does what it claims and doesn't seem to have a lot of stuff running in the background depleting the battery and causing overheating like Androids I've had. Still frustrated by the arcane lack of file management that forces everything through iTunes. Some files just don't get transferred to the phone. Not the fault of the phone; Apple Corp just won't allow convenient computer operations.

  At first I thought I got scammed because the box it came in was just a generic smartphone box, which sounds fine at first, but the box had the details of a completely different phone so I was sweating a bit when I saw that. The phone was correct, though, and came in good condition. It wasn't perfect, as you'd expect from a refurbished phone; there was a tiny scuff in the metal on the upper right corner, but that doesn't bother me one bit since it's covered by my case. I think that $280 is a good price for a well-refurbished iPhone 8, since it also comes with the trust that it's in top renewed condition versus buying for less from FB marketplace or something like that. I also purchased the protection plan which covers drops, cracks, water damage, etc. and it is well worth it to me. After the initial $50 payment, paying $29 to have my phone repaired or $49 to have it replaced in the case of it breaking is a great deal of a protection plan to me.

  This company provides beautiful renewed products! 🙂 I wanted to allow some time to pass before writing a review. I couldn't be happier!I'm very skeptical making larger purchases online especially when it comes to tech products. I'm so glad I took the great deal this company offered as they delivered my phone with perfect quality 10/10.  I purchased the phone renewed and it arrived in seemingly brand new condition, everything works like new. A glitch once in a while is normal for all iPhones and I still haven't even seen one! I've been enjoying this phone every day since I received it ✌🏼

  Apparently this product comes from some international market that does NOT allow for the shutter to be muted or changed. The noise is particularly loud and effectively renders the camera unusable in public places.

  I activated this phone a couple days ago and so far it's been what i expected. The one issue I have found is that on snapchat you have to turn the volume down, open the snap and then turn the volume back up to listen to it but this is probably an issue with snapchat rather then the phone. Would recommend.

  This phone is great. We are on fixed incomes and didn't want to spend an outrageous amount of money to upgrade from our iPhone 6. So, we purchased this refurbished phone from Amazon and have been very pleased. The phone, although used, looks absolutely brand new and operates like a new phone as well. We were so pleased with the phone I got, that my husband bought a similar one from Amazon just last week. Thank you for making options like this available for people who don't need, want, or can afford the latest and greatest gadgets.

    Hesitated based on reviews - but VERY happy
  
",5.0,WatermarkSD,"Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  There are several people on here that wrote reviews saying the phone didn't work on Verizon, broke shortly after, etc.  It certainly made me pause before purchasing, but I really needed a replacement phone for my son and wasn't going to pay top dollar for a new phone again.I ordered the phone on a Tuesday, and was surprised when the FedEx box showed up on Thursday (a full 4 days earlier than estimated).  Next, the packaging was decent and included a genuine charger plug and cable.  Finally, the phone looked absolutely brand new.  Not a touch or smudge anywhere.  I immediately took it to the Verizon store, and they got it registered on the network within 5 minutes.I know there are other reviews that had similar experiences as mine, but you always think that you are going to be the one that gets the dud that doesn't work.  It would seem like it's a good company though and perhaps they'd swap it out if you happen to be unlucky (I can imagine it has to occasionally happen - it is a used phone after all, each with a different history).  Apparently I got one from a grandma that didn't take it out of the box. :)Overall, very happy.  Hopefully you will be just as fortunate.  And if not, I'd feel safe about working with them company to make it right.

  Not Happy with this “renewed” IPhone 8 from AE Cells. According to Amazon, this should be like new, but all 4 corners have damage. The back is heavily scratched. The screen has been replaced with an aftermarket product. The battery health is at 80%, barely meeting the minimum requirement. There’s nothing about this phone that is like new or refurbished. It just looks like someone’s old beat up used phone. Amazon needs to either change the product description or get rid of some third-party sellers.

It seems like the home button gets stuck/doesn’t read a fingerprint or me pushing on it when it shuts down.

I could not justify shelling out more than $1,000 for a phone, so after researching i settled on the iPhone 8 64GB in gold.  I shopped around, and decided to purchase on amazon because of  the Amazon Renewed policy, as well as the ability to purchase 2 year accident protection. My phone arrived with a few very light scratches on the screen (as described), which doesn’t bother me one bit as I always add a glass screen protector. The speed and functionality are also perfect, and setup was easy.  The battery life is not as great as expected, but not enough of an issue to decrease the rating. I purchased from BREED.

  The phone was on time and great however, there was no SIM card included which was a huge hassle as my iPhone 6 card was not compatible. I spent about 3 hours on chat and driving to the sprint store to get this figured out but eventually got it working. All in all it’s a good phone though.

  Upon opening the box there is a packet of information with ""Open me first"" on it.  If you do that the set up is flawless.  Once you turn on your new/used iphone and enable bluetooth and set it next to your old iphone it pretty much transfers all your settings, address book and apps in a matter of minutes, it could not have been any easier. You then use the tool provided and put your sim card in and it's ready to use. On the renewed premium phones the battery health is supposed to be at least 90% or better, to my surprise it's at 100%.  The iphone itself looks like it's a new phone, not a scratch on it, it even has a month or so left on the original Apple warranty from whoever owned it before.  I've been wringing it out, texting, taking pics, making calls and using all of the new features this has to offer that my old iphone 6 plus didn't have and so far so good.  While I liked the bigger screen on the 6 plus I could never get used to the size and wanted a smaller profile with more processing power and this fits the bill for me.  I don't know if all renewed premium phones are like the one I got but I'm really impressed, better yet I have a full year to put it through it's paces.  I wanted to upgrade to a newer faster model iphone without breaking the bank.  My hats off to Amazon and the tech., MM in New Jersey that tested and signed off on the 20 point inspection certificate, nice job on an outstanding phone.

  I've had this phone for a little over a month now and I love it! I was somewhat scared to buy a refurbished phone, but so far this phone is working wonderfully and arrived in nearly perfect condition. There was a teeny tiny little scratch on the side of the phone, but it is barely noticeable. I only noticed it because I was looking for imperfections when I received the phone. It is much cheaper than buying an apple certified refurbished phone and is probably the exact same quality. Unfortunately, the charger is not an apple product, but is working well so far. If you're looking for a quality new phone that is not ridiculously expensive, I would highly recommend purchasing this one!

   I do like writing reviews especially for used phones because it helps everyone. A special shout out to the Synergy phone renewal program team. My iPhone 8 came in perfect condition with the battery capacity of.....99%, really. When I ordered this phone last week I was having second thoughts about needing an iPhone just for work as I already have a iPhone 12mini but didn't want to use it for both personal and work so I took a chance and went with the 8, I was going to get a 7 but the 8 is only $15 more. I kind of hoped it would have some scuffs and that the battery was at 70 something percent capacity  so I could send it back and just use my 12 mini but I don't want the wear and tear on that battery alone as the 12 mini already has a small battery. I told myself the phone would need to be perfect and I would keep it, well perfect it was. I have ordered a Samsung galaxy s8, and it had screen burn in as well as a galaxy s9 plus that had a swollen battery (NOT FROM SYNERGY) so used phones can be hit or miss but this iPhone is brand new just in a different generic box but it came with the official iPhone cable and charging brick, all for $170.00 + tax. So yes I am keeping this for work and am as happy as I will ever be from a used phone, thank you Synergy, you all rock.

  A word to the wise, have BREED check the IMEI of what they're sending you. IMEI's are specific to GSM or CDMA, and even if the phone is fully unlocked, if the IMEI doesn't match, it won't work. For example, Verizon and Sprint have compatible IMEI's, and AT&T and T Mobile are compatible.I got a phone, and the IMEI did not work with my network, which is how I learned about all of this.A word on BREED, though. They are very easy to talk to, and very helpful. I doubt you will have any trouble reaching someone who can help you get the right phone for your network. I returned my phone with no problems, and they were very understanding about the difficulty.

    Works Great But Here's A Tip For Straight Talk Users
  
",5.0,Billy Bob,"Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2019","









  
  
    
  Have only had the phone a couple of days but so far it works great.  It is an iPhone 8, 64GB model.  It looks brand new and everything functions as it should.  A note to Straight Talk users.  That is my carrier and when I put my Straight Talk SIM card in this phone it works great but I went to the Straight Talk website and logged in so I could transfer my new phone and register it.  The website kept giving me an error when I entered the phone's IMEI or serial number so I called Straight Talk support.After working with me for a while, the rep said ""You can't use your current SIM card because you have an unlocked phone.  You are going to have to buy a new SIM card and then register that and the new phone with our ""Bring Your Own Phone"" system on the website.""  I asked if I did that could I keep my phone number and he said yes.  I did some research online and got the impression the the Bring Your Own Phone is not for existing customers, but for new customers or existing customers with new phones who want new phone numbers.  Not sure about that, but my thought is that since the phone works perfect as it is, I am not going to try to upset the apple cart by buying a new SIM and trying to register it with Straight Talk.  I think they don't want us users to have unlocked phones and especially ones that were not purchased through the Straight Talk website or an authorized supplier so I am leaving well enough alone.  The phone works fine with my SIM card, the only thing is that on the Straight talk website it shows I have a Samsung Galaxy instead of an iPhone 8.  No harm, no foul.

  Unable to activate with T-Mobile like advertised. Tried over the phone with Tmobile and at the tmobile store with new sim card both new cards always said invalid sim card. Should have listened to the crappy reviews. Amazon Renew service is a joke.

  I would give this seller a 0 star in everything if I could. Do not buy from this seller they sell you unpaid iPhones and they are not locked. They can’t be connected because they are not paid off so basically useless.

  Unlocked does not mean easy to activate! You must buy a sim card and fight w your service provider to activate it! You better always be home to sign for this item or you will never get it. All this and it was cheaper and easier to get from the boost store.

    Renewed standard hard to meet.

  This is a better iPhone than the 7S and any before it and at same time it’s not a better phone than 8S or any that have come since.I think the renewed standard has set a high bar, one which was not met with my order. There is a visible scratch on the screen that can be seen at an arms reach. I’m not sending it back to wait phoneless for a new one, but I think it’s a valid complaint. One that is probably common in occurrence but not often acted upon.Otherwise the screen graphics and interface is really nice, the processor doesn’t leave me wanting, and all these things are known by almost all iPhone owners. My review is about Renewed, and the difficult standard set that may offer more than what this particular  supplier is able to provide.

    Expected refurbished quality with nonfunctional main speaker.

  After 2 weeks of having this phone, there’s one problem. The bottom/main speaker stopped working and now I can only hear audio from the top speaker, the speaker used for hearing calls, now I can barely hear audio even at max volume, I don’t know how to fix this. I guess I got unfortunate and got a bad phone, this shouldn’t happen to anybody, by at your own risk.

    Low call volume

  The phone works fine except for the call volume. I can hear fine when the call is on speaker but not when I hold the phone to my ear.  I would think that would be tested on a refirbed phone. The company has offered to replace the phone but I would have to return this one 1st and be without a phone while I wait.

    Great seller: PDI Mobile - backs up the products

  I was looking for an older model iPhone with a good amount of life left in it. Since the 8 isn’t sold new anywhere, this refurbished option seemed worth a try. Upon arrival the phone was unlocked and in great shape with only a few minor scrapes on the outside edge; battery life was at 88% of original. The only small problem I was having was that the response to touch on the screen was intermittent, something with which I could probably manage.I decided to ask the seller about a replacement; once I started the return process (with a request for a replacement) the seller communicated very quickly and had a label for me to mail the old phone back that same day.The replacement came in as quickly as the old went out. It had a more responsive touch screen and even better battery life. So far no other problems.I am very happy with the used / renewed phone and even happier that the seller was so easy to work with. Thanks!Seller was PDI Mobile.
