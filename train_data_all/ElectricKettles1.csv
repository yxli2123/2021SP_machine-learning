   Just received the hadineeon double walled electric kettle and it’s an amazing product. I already have another kettle that is made by hadineeon and I was looking for a completely stainless steel kettle that had a cool touch exterior. I found this and it is exactly what I needed.Pros:Entirely stainless on the inside. There is no plastic or silicone whatsoever on the inside.Soft open lid. Some lids pop open splashing hot water on you. This is very well engineered in that regard.Power. 1500w is more than enough power. It heats up 1.5l in roughly 3-5 mins depending on the temperature of the water.Aesthetics are nice. Can’t beat it for the price.Cool touch exterior and being double walled is great for heat retention. I have a kid and my other kettle is glass which gets hot and this has the cool touch which is awesome.Remember that an electric kettle is more than just heating up water for tea and coffee. I use this to preheat water for making pasta which saves a ton of time compared to heating up on stovetop alone.

  It's been two weeks since I get this electrical water hitter it  looks very nice on my kitchen counter interior.  First I boiled water for my tea and OMG, tee  tasted horrible, then i read instructions  and boiled water three times, yes, people ,you should boil water couple of times before you start using it, to remove  whatever stainless steel is cover with ,initially, after that  water taste perfect. Automatic shutdown works perfectly but you should keep water  level between minimum and maximum. You can boil one cup also but you should shut down manually when it starts boiling and it happening very fast. Whole week i've been using this heater very heavy, I  mean very heavy, boiling like  5 gallon of water a day just to make sure it works and I don't have to return ,so far so good ,works perfectly ,I will post another review  in a couple of months.

  Okay, so I am a huge HadinEEon product fan. Why? I had gone through 5 different manufacturer frothers for my coffee cream and theirs was the BEST of all. I loved that item so much that I have bought 4 more over this year as gifts. A few other friends always see the froth and ask for the info so they can buy their own.As for the kettle, I took a photo of the frother (black) and the kettle side by side so you can see that this is a bit larger. It is well made, solid, and I love the way it works. Just lift off the power base and place it back on. The water gets to be boiling hot but the kettle stays cool to the touch outside. It works exactly as advertised and I have no doubt that I will likely be buying more for my friends, ... tea lovers of not.Note: My wife loves to take her coffee with her in the morning and I have found that by simply prewarming the inside of the cup-thermos with hot water, her coffee stays a lot hotter through the day. This makes 'that' job even easier. No mess, easy clean up and a grade A in my book.I highly recommend!

  The HadinEEon Electric Kettle 1.5L, 100% Stainless Steel Interior Double Wall Electric Tea Kettle is a fantastic buy.Highly recommend.If you haven't used an electric kettle to help cooking meals of all types, you do not know what you are missing! This double-walled kettle heats water fast and efficiently. It looks great on the counter and is the perfect tool to add to your kitchen arsenal. We heat water often for everything from Ramen noodles and oatmeal to hot drinks of all types or when you just need to add some hot water to any recipe. This kettle is perfect for all applications and the kettle separates from the base so you can move the hot water around safely and independently.This is a great kettle for the price/cost.We are gifting some to family and friends that haven't yet used an electric kettle but saw ours in action during the most recent holiday.

   I always wanted a reliable Kettle , this one seems doing the job..as u see also it matches our kitchenI used electric kettle for some time. current one worked well as well,but it had 2 issues and this one resolved both:It's hot when water is hot and by accident (without thinking) i touched it a few timesand the bottom is wide, but top is narrow, so it was very difficult to clean inside.This kettle has 2 walls  so i can touch outside even when the water is hot inside.Also, bottom/top is same size and wide enough to put my hand inside to clean inside wall.1- Its outside is white but modern white, not the old shining white color.2- The Doube walls, so outside is not hot when inside water is hot.3- The nice looking, modern designIt is perfect for my family, specially we are considered Al coffeholic :)

    Easy to Use, BPA-free Electric Kettle

  This kettle is convenient to use especially with the cordless design. Even though I only use the kettle for myself, the size capacity on this thing allows me to boil a lot of water real fast - I drink a lot of tea and generally prefer warm/hot water over cold/room temp so I'm constantly refilling my mug. My favorite feature is the automatic shut off because I tend to forget to check on the stove when boiling water. Also, this kettle is aesthetically designed so I usually just leave it on the counter when not using it. You can also wrap the cord around the charger base so it makes storage really neat.

    Fast, Hot, and Easy To Use! Just What I Wanted!

  I've been looking for a relatively small electric kettle for a while. We had a coffee maker that worked just fine, but cleaning and using it just didn't feel right. I'm very much a chai mix person rather than straight coffee but my mother loves a quick cup in the morning. So, having a full size coffee maker just wasn't the most expedient or efficient.I wanted a relatively small one, not too large like 2 liters or more, we don't drink that much at once. I wanted something that worked fast, like done in 5 minutes fast. And I wanted something that was ""one and done,"" no fuss or complicated settings. And I got all that with this kettle.This is 1.5 L, so a little larger than I wanted, but it works out great. Plenty for a few cups without wasting too much. Barely takes a minute to fill to the recommended level, and with ONE button, it's going. Takes a few minutes to boil, and you can definitely tell that it's boiling. It is a bit louder than I originally thought, you can hear the kettle heating up and then the boiling, so if you want a silent kettle, this one isn't it. Depending on when you're using it, really early in the morning while other people are asleep or if you have very little distance between the kettle and a bedroom, this could be an issue, but for us, it's nothing to complain about. The water is BOILING hot when done and it auto clicks off, both with sound and the light under the button. You can easily tell the difference between the kettle being on or off for safety.I've heard complaints that the lid doesn't open as fully, but I don't see an issue. My hands aren't so big they can't clean it when needed. And I always pull the plug when I know I won't be using if again during the day just for caution. I originally wanted something with a warming function, but truthfully, I don't miss it. The kettle heats so fast normally, I wouldn't need it, and as we are not habitual drinkers throughout the day, it's a non issue.Overall, I love this thing. It works exactly as I wanted it to, and we get use out of it every day. I'm drinking more coffee now than I did before (which some people might think is a bad thing), but I enjoy it.

    Small footprint, Modern Design, Simple Operation!
  
",5.0,Paul S,"Reviewed in the United States January 18, 2021","









  
  
    
  Should've bought this sooner.  What a time saver and it's so simple to use!  I was using a coffee maker for hot water since I always use hot water for tea, hot chocolate, instant soups and Korean instant coffee but 1. It takes up a large amount of counter space 2. It's UGLY.  3. You have to deal with cleaning out the pot so your hot water doesn't have a coffee after taste. 4. It steams from the back, which can ruin your cabinets over time.This handy appliance fixes all of that!  Small footprint on your counter so you can leave it there all the time.  The design is very simple and modern.  I don't need this to be a show piece on my counter.  I just need it to be out of the way and heat water quickly.  It takes 3-5 minutes to heat up water to a perfect hot temperature depending on how much water is on there.  It does steam for the last 30 seconds or so from the spout.  However, you can rotate it so that it faces out.  No more steaming my cabinets!If you use hot water for tea, hot chocolate, soups or whatever, buy it.  You won't regret it.

  This electric kettle is a worthy investment. I've been hesitant over the years to purchase an electric kettle because of lack of storage in my kitchen, but I'm so glad I decided to give this one a try.Pros- it boiled water in 1.5 less minutes than my traditional stovetop kettle- cord could around base for convenience and clean looking storage- matte finish on outside of kettle gives it a more classic look- easy to cleanCons:- bigger than a stovetop tea kettleOverall, this a great purchase and will shorten the time needed to boil water and do it in style.

  My last kettle was giving away and I wanted to buy a new one. I came across this fantastic product. It boils the water just like any other, but it double wall, keeps the kettle completely safe to touch from anywhere (no hot on the outside). This is perfect for my house as my kids are just getting to an age where they want to help in kitchen, but I am afraid they might touch hot surfaces. With this kettle, I am not concerned anymore. I know there is 1 less item they touch can burn them (they still are not allowed to pour water from it).On the functionality side, this is just perfect. A very quiet kettle, which boils the water perfect and auto shuts. After a few uses, I wanted to wash the kettle. The inside is 1 single stainless steel container, so when i opened to clean, it was super easy to clean, and the chance of scaling is very minimal as well.Overall a fantastic product. I am satisfied knowing the product is backed by 3 year warranty.

  This thing is awesome. So easy to use and clean. Just be sure to not fill it above the Max Fill Line. That is very important. Otherwise, you'll end up with water inside the handle lol. It is so easy to use. Just fill to the max line, set it on the base, and push the switch down to start it. Hot water is ready in about a minute (I haven't actually timed it). Water stays hot in the pot for a while after your pour your first cup. I have an oversized coffee mug that I drink from and I can fill it a little more than twice before I have to heat more water. The appearance of this item is very sleek and modern. Looks great on my counter. Definitely recommend this!!

  Good for the cost! I purchased The kettle on Dec 11, have used it for 3 months. It is very easy to use and heats water to boiling very quickly, even when filled to the Max setting. The on/off button is easy to use; the heating element base is very lightweight, with a power cord 2 ft 6 inches. Features of this kettle that I like include entirely stainless steel inside, inner lid as well as the stainless steel open spout filter; easier to pour water; the lid opens softly instead of pop open prevents hot water from splashing on you;  the non-slip grip handle stays cool to the touch while your water comes to a boil quickly. 1.5L is good enough for my daytime use.

  We had a great electric kettle that was a gift and it stopped working. Ever since then, we have been looking for a good one and unfortunately we never found one that was as good. Usually, the issues we have is that the mouth is too small to clean and we see a lot of mineral build up that is hard to clean.What I like about this one is the mouth is large enough to clean. Since it's stainless steel, its really easy to add water, vinegar and lemon to make sure it's clean.This one does have a minimum amount of water that needs to be in (about 2.5 cups) before you can boil. I recommend using a measuring cup and filtered water so you ensure that the electric kettle doesn't have too much build up and that you always reach the minimum mark.Also-love that you can hide the cord underneath! Helps you keep your countertop looking neat!

  In the interest of full disclosure, we were offered a gift card for a good review. I initially held off on posting a review just because of that reason. So now that the kettle has actually been put the ringer of multiple daily use cycles since December I can attest that this kettle is worth every dollar we spent on it. Pro to this kettle, we purchased one at Costco, a Chefman, and that didn’t last bit over a month and a half with a lot of daily use. The plastic lid hinge gave  out which affected the shut off switch. After a long time searching for a new kettle, we took a gamble on this one. This one has an all stainless interior, no plastic exposed to the water and steam. The lid on the HadinEEon has operated precisely since day one. It opens and closes perfectly still. The water heats up quick and we have never had one issue with it. Yes I would buy this again. The price is competitive and there are NO leaks when pouring. Kudos on a great product!

  I was searching to replace an old ""Hot Shot""  single serving water heater that we primarily use for tea.  I was not extremely concerned with the insulation factor nor the fact that the HadinEEon holds 6 cups of water but I have come to appreciate both pluses.  The unit is very well insulated and the ability to heat water for more than one user at a time, works out really well.  It feels like a sturdy, well made unit.  I have not put a thermometer in the water at the end of the auto shut-off cycle but it is  very very hot.  Bottom line - I'm very pleased.

  This color is just so cute (and in the end is what made me click buy)! So let me begin by saying I am a tea addict I drink tea 3 to 4 times a day and this kettle is so quick and just a perfect option for making hot water for tea. We also use it very frequently to make hot water for our cup of soup noodles. Heat the water.Pour the water. And boom there is dinner! No dishes either! When I cook I use it to viol water fast as it takes about half the time to boil the same amount of water in the kettle as it does on the stove top!We took it camping and it’s just a nice kettle comfort of home still just as easy and worth wile as at home!Only thing I would have liked to know before I bought was that there is no bell that lets you know the water is boiling. It gets to a vertical temperature... my water is always a full rolling boil... and then turns it’s self off. And if you are not paying attention you can miss the tiny click it makes! But worst case this happens you go back and turn it on again it will only take a few moments for it to get back to that top temperature!!!

  After a lifetime of stainless-steel kettles, I started out wanting to purchase a glass kettle this time, but this one won me over instead with several features.First, it caught my eye with its cute, retro color.Secondly, its shape. Most kettles tend to have a body that tapers towards the top, which helps retain heat so the kettle boils faster, but also makes the top opening narrow, which makes the kettle harder to clean, which I hate. This kettle doesn't have that problem, and here is why:I liked the concept of cool-touch surface, which was definitely a great safety feature - con: no little window through which to see how much water is in there; pro: double-wall construction means the kettle retains heat well and water remains hot for longer periods of time, so refills don't require reheating quite as often - obviously, the pro far outweighs the con.I have been using it for two weeks now, and so far all the benefits and no apparent problems. Definitely an excellent product I would recommend to others looking to replace an old kettle.

  If you are on the fence about purchasing the HadinEEon Electric Kettle, let me remove your doubt. The HadinEEon Electric Kettle is an excellent addition to your kitchen. Both at home or office. I have used this kettle every day now for a few weeks and have found it to be a most satisfactory performer. First off, let me make clear it does the job it's supposed to do: Boil water quickly. But in addition to that it: keeps it hot, pours easily, and is pleasing to the eye. Now before you start thinking this review is too glowing for it to be real I will point out one little thing that the HadinEEon Electric Kettle could stand a little improvement on...the lid could open a little wider so as to make it a little easier to add water. That's it. The issue wouldn't stop me from buying one as a gift or recommending it to a friend. Good luck finding your perfect kettle. Hopefully, I have made that search a little easier.

   I was in need of replacing my cheap plastic kettle that was over 15 years old and wanted a cordless one. This one ticked all the boxes for me. The color is bright and stands out in my kitchen. The base is sturdy and has a cord wrap underneath to keep the cord organized. The kettle itself is light and heats up fast! I filled the kettle up a couple times and boiled each time to get rid of the ‘new smell’ before I used it for my cup of tea. Kettle is easy to pick up off the base. Great product for the price.

  I am very impressed by this kettle which is by far the best I have ever had.The entire interior is made of stainless steel with no seams at the bottom. In other kettles, the spout has a flimsy filter but in this one, it is sturdy and part of the kettle itself.It takes about 5 min. to boil if full which for me is good. I wasn't expecting the outside wall to remain cool to the touch.It looks like the lid has a magnetic mechanism because it closes with minimal effort.Finally, I absolutely love the color!

  The kettle is lightweight but sturdy. Cool to touch outside. It's easy to clean, I could reach inside with no problem. Easy to handle and use. Not flimsy or clunky. Perfect size. The on and off switch is located on the base. The kettle is easy to lift off the base to poor and clean. The filtered spout doesn't spatter or splash hot water back up while pouring. It has automatic shut off after water finishes boiling. I can make about 3 and 1/2  16oz wide beer mug size cups of tea before refilling water. I use it almost everyday for tea, coffee, hot  cereal, or soup. I really like that it stays hot longer than heating by microwave. I really like it and would buy this again. It's so much easier and convenient than using a stove top tea kettle. I recommend this HadinEEon brand.

  I like this one much better than my previous one, which was about 10 years old at this point. This has stainless covering the whole inside, including the inside of the lid. No plastic touching the water. The water heats up  pretty fast. The outside stays cool.  The kettle is very light  weight. Overall pretty great so far. I wish the lid would open up a full 90 degrees,  so that I could fit the kettle in my fridge door water dispenser to fill it up. No big deal, and other than that it's great.

  I bought this to take camping because I'm tired of waiting 45 minutes for coffee in the morning. This fully heated to a boil at maximum water capacity in just under 6 minutes! It was cool to the touch even after heating twice in a row. It's heavy duty and I believe it will hold up quite well for camping.I like also that its stainless steel but coated so it won't scratch.I like it enough that I plan to keep it in the kitchen and use it at home as well.

  Works really well, and looks nice on my counter.  The only thing that would change my review from 4 to 5 stars, would be if it kept the water hot longer.  It stays warm for a while, in the kettle, but not hot enough for that next cup of coffee.  I need to re-heat it when I'm ready for that next cup.  But, it's still really fast, so that's not a deal breaker.

  (I waited two months to write this)Once taking it out of the box, it is a bit bigger than expected but, I am not mad at that, at all. This thing is perfect. Because it lifts off of the base, no need to deal with annoying wires.  No need to unplug and plug it back in to use again. It does sound like a rocker starting, when it boils. But, you get used to it 😄. Get it. You won't regret it.

  I already had a regular electric tea kettle but I heard good things about double-walled electric kettles so I wanted to give one a try. After looking around I settled on this one.After it arrived I compared it with my other kettle: they both heated the water in around the same time. When I came back 2 hours later to check the temperature, my regular kettle's temperature was ~142°F and this kettle was around 165°F. So the double-walls really do work and I'm very happy with it.

  I have used this kettle everyday for 2 weeks now and LOVE it. It heats the water up very quickly and I like the auto shut off feature so I can walk away if needed. The outside stays cool after the water is done boiling, so you can set the kettle on the table without worrying that it will burn your tabletop. The design is very appealing to the eye, clean and modern. Also big bonus - this one is all stainless steel inside so you don't have to worry about the hot water coming into contact with any plastic! My only minor complaint is that I wish there was a temperature control as the water heats up SUPER HOT. I use it for tea so I let it rest a little longer to let it cool off a little but it's not a big deal.

  What I like about this HadinEEon Electric Kettle is that it has 100% Stainless Steel Interior and there is not contact of the hot water with any plastic parts and therefore there is no risk of contamination or plastic/rubber taste on water. The Double Wall prevents any involuntary contact with a hot surface which is a good safety feature. The body of the kettle is cylindrical and not tapped which allows a good size lid and an easy cleaning process which is also important to consider. It is not noise and its modern European design goes well with my kitchen. I purchased it on Dec.13, 2020 and it is working very well without any problems. It is an excellent product with a fair price, I highly recommend it.

  Looked for a new kettle replacement and already had this brand's milk frother so I thought why not. Turned out to be a great choice. Love that its double walled with stainless steel. We got the pastel green which was an awesome color to boot.Pros: boils fast as any other kettle, larger capacity for those extra guests, and my favorite: retains the hot water temperature for about 3 hours post-boil. (by 3 hrs, water is still hot enough to enjoy a nice cup a tea).Cons: nothing really, if I was being picky, then a small view or indicator for current water level would be nice, but really no complaints here!

The base of this kettle can accommodate any unused length of cord - just be sure to lay the cord flat as the base is relatively light.

  I got this kettle because I really wanted one in my classroom.  I have purchased HadinEeon before and decided to give them another try.  Again I am satisfied with the products they have.  The double-layer wall is perfect for having in the classroom that way I know none of my students will get burned if they touch it.  It heats my water fast and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I would love it if there was a keep warm option just to keep the water warm throughout the day, but it doesn't take much effort to push the button.

  It is elegant to look at and works like a charm. Frankly, at first sight, I thought it was too big for my needs but, alas, it seems to know how big it should be. I am also surprised at how quickly it brings water to a boil. The whole process is automatic so there is no fear of water boiling away. It discreetly ""pops"" off when done. Loving it.

  This electric kettle is awesome for heating water quickly. I find it especially useful for ramen noodles. I heat the water, put the ramen noodles in a bowl, add water, cover it and wait 5 minutes and there are no dirty pans to clean up. If you live in an area with hard water, it's easy to clean with a small amount of vinegar. Pour in the vinegar, wait 5 minutes, swish the residue with a cloth, empty, and rinse with clear water.

The outsides stay cool enough to touch.  It is easy to poor.  No splashing.  The flip top lid means that I do not get burnt by the stream anymore.  A draw back is it requires a minimum of just over 2 cups.  I always put the minimum into the kettle and pour any unused boiling water onto my sink sponge to sanitize it.  So this works for me.

It is very fast to heat up water (which is important when you don't have unlimited electricity available).  It heats to boiling in just a few seconds.  It is lightweight, a beautiful teal color and stores compactly in my cupboards.  I highly recommend this kettle - a great product at a great price!

  I have a couple of HadinEEon products and I would say they are very reliable! The new Double Wall Electric Kettle looks really simple and good. It has a very good capacity too. I tested the Safety Boil-Dry Protection by turning on the kettle without water. The kettle automatically turned off after 5 seconds. I also noticed that it heats the water fast and the water is very hot!

I tried their suggested methods of descaling but the spots didn’t budge so I’ll have to try some other tricks.

  I wanted to really love this kettle... pretty color, all metal inside and great reviewed heating element. I was looking for a better electrics kettle then my $20 cheap one from the store I had been using for years. I received this and got only 3 uses out of it before it quit working. My last use, near the end of the heating cycle, I witnessed bright white flashes I side the base of the kettle. Looked like a lighting storm inside it, was very odd. I didn't think much of it because I didn't smell any burnt plastic, metal or view any burn marks anywhere. So my next use, the switch light turned on but no heating cycle started at all. I even tried 2 different outlets. My guess is the base heating element over charged itself and just quit working. I was seriously bummed. Refunded immediately and shipped back to Amazon....Watch out for the overheating and white flashes, keep your eye on it. Even though this is a beautiful kettle, I would not recommend it.

  It is light weight, heats up quickly and is bigger than I need so it is heavy when it is full of water. It doesn't turn off fast enough for me once it is boiling which means the steam is heavy under the kitchen cabinets and against the backsplash. It feels more cheaply made than my previous pot which was stainless and lasted 12 years, so we shall see how long this one lasts. Fingers crossed.Seller is bribing me with a $20 gift coupon. The worst part of this is that he is clueless of his poor ethics.In his own words:Thanks very much for your review.

  This kettle is sleek, and boils quickly. I wouldn't say it's quiet, but it's not terribly loud. The inside is a stainless steel which the outside is a sleek white plastic finish. The water gets quite hot, quite quickly and has an automatic shut off. My only wish, and is the same wish for the frother we have, is that they had weighted he base a little bit so that it wouldn't move around as easily when I pick up the kettle. I also wish that the top lid came off for easier cleaning.

  Heats up nicely and arrived well-packaged. I have used it three times now and my only issue so far is you need to do a slow-pour or the seal on the top lifts up a bit and water comes out of the top instead of the spout. It does tell you in the directions to pour slowly, so they do warn you. I am impressed with the thoroughness of the directions for care and maintenance. Very easy to clean. I have young children so not having the outside get hot to the touch was a must and having ran it three times now, it will not burn if you touch the outside. The double wall insulation is nice and kept the water hot for about 30 min on the stand.

",3.0,Alexis,"Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2021","









  
  
    
  This is my first electric kettle so I didn’t know what I needed, but I wanted one so I could make tea. I like the look of this kettle, it works fine, it is easy to use, and it’s simple to clean. It holds a lot of water, and it requires a lot of water at minimum to use. I’m only one person so because of this, I had to boil way more water than I needed to brew my tea. Also, I couldn’t use the hot water fast enough for my tea before it started going cold. So I am returning this to get a different kettle with a “keep warm” setting.

  The kettle looks nice and feels sturdy when using. Two things to note:1. If the kettle is filled at or even slightly over the Max line then the lid pops up a little. Some steam comes out but it may not allow the auto shutoff to kick in.2. Do not pour too fast. The spout doesn't pour well at full tilt and hot water can splash or run down the kettle.Luckily I had read the comments before purchasing and was aware that these things could happen. Otherwise, it seems to be a solid appliance.

  I’ve own multiple electric kettles in my life since I’m an avid tea and coffee drinker. This kettle is by far the worst. The outside is made of plastic - not colored SS the way it looks on pic. It takes two hands just to press down to open the lid because of the cheap plastic. Very disappointed. Looks pretty on my counter but NOT functional. Going back to my old kettle. Also not thrilled with the milk frother of the same brand. There are better ones out there

  The website gave the impression that the auto shut-off switch would work once the water was boiled. But, in fact, there is no such feature. The shut-off switch only works when the water is all boiled away. Not what we were seeking. We did find one, for the same price (actually slightly cheaper) that did have this feature.

  I love this how this kettle looks and that it is all stainless steel inside.  It’s good that there is a boil dry feature, but I kind of wish it stopped boiling automatically after it came to a boil.I also like that it does not drip when pouring like my old kettle.This kettle arrived only in the manufacturer’s packaging and the box was pretty beat up on arrival - thank goodness the kettle stayed in perfect condition.

  UPDATED review, Feb 15:a DIFFERENT CS emailed me, solved all the problems, and did it professionally and well. I now have a new kettle, one which is quiet. The new one is fast, the auto-shutoff works brilliantly (the old one didn't and I didn't know it was supposed to - that's something HadinEEon needs to make clear in the product description - there actually IS auto-shutoff, both when the water boils AND on boil-dry/kettle turned on with no water in it. It's a beautiful kettle, I chose it because it is attractive, and now that it works well, I'm VERY happy, using it every morning! Obviously, the old one was defective, which happens. Good CS is worth it's weight in gold to customer relations, as is a company willing to back up it's products.*******************************************************Review on Feb 5:I have never used an electric kettle before, and since I loved the look of this, I bought the white one. I could only find one review addressing noise, so I went ahead with the purchase. It is astonishing. It sounds like a small jet engine from the moment I push the ""ON"" lever to the moment I take the kettle off the base. I emailed Longlive US (3rd party seller?) customer service. They asked for a video, so I made one and sent it, along with saying that the power cord gets warm when it's heating water. The first email I got from them was wonderful, they asked for my shipping address so they could send a new kettle, were concerned and polite. I sent the video, and the answer I got back shocked me. They were snide and condescending.To quote from their email, ""The kettle will make noise during the boiling process because the water will produce a lot of bubbles during the boiling process, and the bursting of the bubbles will produce noise. If the kettle is just noisy, this is normal.""2 things: I actually have boiled water a few times during my long life. I know boiling water produces some noise (but NOT like this does), and why - but it doesn't normally vibrate my kitchen cabinet, nor can I hear it from another room in my house. This kettle makes noise from the moment I push the ""On"" lever, not just when the water begins to boil. Once the water is boiling, it's fairly quiet - thus even the reason given doesn't hold up.If HadinEEon/Longlive US knows the kettle is this noisy, why didn't they just say so in the reply to my first email, and why aren't there more reviews saying something about how noisy this kettle is? Better yet, why don't they do something about it?At this point, I will NEVER buy from this vendor again, and I'm sad Amazon allows sellers with this attitude on their 3rd party platform. The seller, btw, isn't HadinEEon, it's Longlive US.

  So I love that this kettle has no coil inside and is well insulated to keep the water hot. However, it is much larger than I expected (almost twice the size of my old kettle which held .2L more), and the lid is tricky. It sticks to open and sometimes popped open when the force of the steam was too much, resulting in some steam billowing out and potential for burns.All that said - it's very sturdy and well made, easy to clean, and quiet. Just wasn't exactly what we were looking for!

    DEFECTIVE Shutoff Design
  
",2.0,Chris Edwards,"Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2021","

   UPDATE, Jan 13, 2021 - I received a second kettle and it has the same auto shutoff defect.  The other reviews describing this issue are accurate, the kettle design will not allow for the shutoff after boil feature to work.  This is due to the hinge design combined with the shutoff being linked to the lid having to be fully closed. Our kettles in the past weren't dependent on the lid being sealed, so not sure why this one requires it, but the 1 mm gap caused by the less than perfect fit & finish in combination with the steam pressure forcing the lid slightly up, causes a gap that won't allow the auto-off function to operate.  After 2 kettles, I'm done trying this out and will order a different kettle.Jan 7, 2021 - The design, finish, etc. met expectations. However, the auto off function did not work. The water boiled and continued to boil and never shut off. I've requested a replacement. If the replacement is of better quality, I'll revise my review.

  I researched electric ""tea kettles"" for months and hesitated to even buy one. There are so many of them on Amazon, (which one to buy?!), and after all, isn't a tea kettle on the stove or a Pyrex glass in the microwave sufficient for heating water? Well, yes they are, and I've used those two things forever, but I'll never go back after owning this HadinEEon Electric Kettle. I was wary about the brand, had never heard of it, but it is the most satisfying piece of equipment in my kitchen these days. Heats up so quickly, gives a very satisfying ""rumble"" as it's heating, and you can hear it begin to boil. Seconds later, it's done and turns itself off with a click. Heats to the minimum line in about 2.5 minutes, and a full max line in about 7 minutes. I typically add just above the minimum line, which I think is about 16-18 oz., and in 2.5 minutes (at least twice as fast as a microwave) it's done. It's easy to pour, keeps it's boiling (or near) temperature throughout the pour (fantastic for pour over coffee) and I just love it. I never thought I'd enjoy a simple little device more than I do this thing. Hope it lasts for many years to come!

  Going to have to return the kettle. I was very excited to use it. But upon opening the box and taking the kettle out you can instantly tell that it’s been used. There is some kind of spot it almost looks like food on that inside of the lid, as well as a dent. There is also some kind of dried liquid at the bottom of the kettle. I normally wouldn’t mind much but since it’s used I’m going to have to return it. Very sad. (Sorry if the pictures are great, especially the one of the inside of the lid I couldn’t get the camera to focus very well.)Edit: just showed the kettle to someone else and we realized that it also has a dent at the bottom on one of the sides. Not going to buy from this seller or this brand again.

   I bought this kettle as a gift for my husband, and it turned out to be a blessing for me as well.  Initially, I purchased it based on a review that said something to the effect that if Apple were going to make an electric kettle, this would be the one.  My husband being an Apple fan, I took a chance on it.  I'm glad I did.  This is the quickest and easiest way to heat up water.  It is faster than the microwave and stovetop, and it is super easy to keep clean.  I have had it for about three months and it still looks and works great.  At first, I was worried about the cord, which seemed like it didn't want to relax enough to let the base lay flat.  After a few days, though, it relaxed and sits very well.  Another concern was whether I would easily be able to tell when my water is the right temp since it does not have a timer.  A few trial and error sessions and I found the perfect amount of time for me, which is about 45 seconds when filled to minimum.  I was pleasantly surprised after a few times that I could determine its readiness based on the pitch of the sound emitting from the kettle.  As far as kitchen appliances go, this one is my favorite.  It is so simple, lightweight, attractive, and easy to operate.  I highly recommend it.

  I love this electric kettle! It heats the water very quickly, the exterior is always cool to the touch, it isn't too heavy/bulky and it has a simple yet beautiful look. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the lid is slightly misaligned by about 1/4 of an inch. It hasn't affected the product in a negative way at all, it just doesn't look as perfect as I'd like when you are looking at it up close. Even with the slight imperfection I would still purchase the kettle again!

  This is the first electric kettle I've ever owned (I've always used stove kettles) and I really like it. However, within the first 4 days it developed brown spots on the bottom inside of the kettle.... which is odd to me because I always refresh the water every day - maybe I'm supposed to let it air dry out every night? When I try to clean it, brown residue from that area comes off like rust but the spots remain. I know it can develop scaling from water but I just didn't think it would happen so soon, and it's only on the bottom.... Anyways, I enjoy it and how fast it boils the water and am happy with the purchase.

    Design Flaw
  
",1.0,Vlad,"Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  This electric kettle has a major design flaw – the automatic shut-off is intermittent and it is due to the fact that the lid does not stay fully closed when the water is boiling.  Apparently the shut-off sensor works only when the lid is fully closed.  However, when the water is at full boil, a lot of steam is being generated and the lid is being forced up by the steam.  The difference between the lid being fully closed and slightly open due to the force of steam is approximately 1-2 mm (the first picture has lid fully closed, the 2nd picture with red circle and arrows shows the gap created by steam force) – and this amount is enough to cause the auto-shut off sensor not to work.  If you put something heavy on the lid to keep it closed while the kettle is boiling, it will auto-shut off – but what’s the point of keeping another object on top of the lid.  Hence this is a major design flaw.Additional issues with this kettle – started to see spots (see 3rd picture) on the bottom of the kettle (rust and/or mineral deposit spots) exactly after the 2nd use!  Instructions say to clean the kettle dry after every single use – sorry, that’s a pain in the rear – I don’t have to do this to my regular stove kettle.  At approximately sea level (where I live), it takes 5-7 minutes to boil when filled to the Max line.  Not any faster than on the regular stove top kettle (probably slower).  And it is actually pretty loud.What’s good about this kettle – No plastic parts come in contact with water.  It is double-walled, so less of a chance to get burned.  The white finish is nice (at least when new).  Full kettle balances well in the hand and you have good pour control (but if you pour fast, it will spill over).  *The handle is fairly thick and I can see it might not be comfortable for people with small hands.It seems that just about all electric kettles these days have one or more significant issues.  The ones that are advertised as all metal (read no plastic or silicone touches the water) seem to be made out of inferior stainless steel.  I would not mind paying more for a product that is actually well made and has true Stainless Steel.  Otherwise, they are all useless because they are pretty much guaranteed to rust.  A shame, really.  Also, it looks like there is only 1 or 2 primary manufacturers of these kettles in China that make basically same kettle with slightly different designs for different brands – so they will all have the same problem, regardless of what they are called.I obviously returned this back to Amazon.

  There is a coupon for some dollars off for the next purchase if you leave a nice review in the box. In my opinion this is how they get 5 stars.The kettle boils the water but does not shut off. The problem is the top cover does not close tight, if you press on it and hold it while water boils the kettle shuts off, but if you are not there it will keep boiling.Grabbing the kettle too close to the top can get you burned as well, because the cover does not close tight or maybe there are some cracks.Overall quality is like a cheap boot-leg knock off of a good brand. Do not be fooled by nice pictures. The inside metal part is not aligned well with outside plastic. Also the holes inside the all metal body are not finished with chamfers. Cheap technology, cheap knock off. I am surprised that Amazon allows this to be sold in US.

  for coffee or tea, i used electric kettle for some time.  current one worked well as well, but it had 2 issues and this one resolved both: 1) it's hot when water is hot and by accident (without thinking) i touched it a few times  2) bottom is wide, but top is narrow, so it was very difficult to clean inside. this kettle has 2 walls (inside/outside), so i can touch outside even when the water is hot inside.  Also, bottom/top is same size and wide enough to put my hand inside to clean inside wall.pro:  1) doube walls, so outside is not hot when inside water is hot.  2) wide upper part, so i can clean inside by putting my hands inside  3) nice looking, modern design (not the old style stainless)con: no 'con', but as wish list... i'd like to have a button to keep hot water hot continuously.  my old one had this feature and it's nice sometimes, but it's 'asking more'

    If Apple Designed Electric Kettles, This Would Be It
  
",5.0,FriscoDad,"Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've had a few months of experience now with various electric kettles and this I have to say this is not only the easiest one to use, but pleasing on the eyes. To me, an electric kettle should be very straight-forward, easy to use, and just work. This kettle by HadinEEon does all that. The button to open is simple and direct, the water is hot indicator highly visible, and there is a pleasing, soft click when the lid closes.I can't emphasize that click enough. You know when you open the coffee pot and then close it? You have that loud sound of the plastic hitting the glass container?  That's unnerving to me. I've heard that from other electric kettles. But not this one. This one sounds like that satisfying thump when you close the door of a finely engineered car door.As far as it's place in the kitchen, this product just blends into your kitchen and sits there quietly. It's an electric kettle right? You don't want it to be attracting too much attention to itself. You want it to be part of your kitchen appliances, ready to use at a moments notice, and then blend back in. This kettle just has that very aesthetically pleasing design.Anyway, I look up and can't believe I wrote three paragraphs about an electric kettle. But I liked it. You will too.

    Great Basic Kettle
  
",5.0,J. Adams,"Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  I wanted two kettles, one that you could adjust the temperature and another that is basic just for boiling.  I wanted two, because the water where I live is very hard, so I didn't want to constantly clean my variable HadinEEon temperature one (that I love) by also boiling tap water to cook with.  So I will only use filtered water in the variable (daily use for tea) and tap water in this basic one (irregular use for cooking).  This particular model seemed to fit the bill.As you can see, this one is larger than my silver one and is not see-through.  I do not like the aesthetics of this one as much, but this one will just be under my cabinet so it doesn't really matter.  This boils a minimum of .5L (2 cups) and a max of 1.5L (6 cups).  My other, which looks smaller, actually boils from .5-2L so it actually holds more!  This kettle has a wider opening though, so that is nice.  It makes it easier to clean and pour water into.  The interior has the minimum and max water lines but does not have measurements marked.I tested how long it takes to boil the minimum in both, and they were both consistent at about 2m20s with room temp water.  This one has a stainless steel food-grade container whereas my other one is glass.  Both kettle materials are MUCH better than plastic, although the steel one may hold the water temperature more since it is double insulated.Overall, I like this one much less than my other HadinEEon kettle with all the bells, whistles, and pretty looks, but at almost half the price, this kettle is perfect for what I want it for (basic consistent boiling with no plastic touching my water from a great brand) so I cannot ding it a star.

    Questionable Stainless Steel
  
",3.0,Kay,"Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2021","









  
  
    
  I have looked high and low for a tea kettle with NO plastic that comes into contact with boiling water. I thought I had finally found the perfect solution. And it was a great price! It arrived and was bigger than my previous Chef's Choice kettle that I'd had for years, so I wasn't super crazy about this taking up more space on the counter. But I would have lived with that. But then I boiled a batch of water in it and dumped it out before boiling my first batch of tea water, and after just two boils the bottom of the tea kettle looked like you see in the picture. I waited until it dried and I ran my hand over the spots and my fingers ALL came out with a light silver/gray dust on them. I repeated this several times and my fingers kept coming out of the kettle with silver dust on them. My Chef's Choice never ever did this. Ever. So I'm questioning the quality of the steel.  Knowing I was going to return it, I bought a Cuisinart kettle and there is a marked difference in the feel of the stainless steel inside both kettles. This one seemed thinner. The Cuisinart did NOT do the spots/silver dust thing after boiling. I still give this kettle 3 stars because it boiled water fast and was quiet, doesn't get hot on the outside and I love that there's not plastic on the inside at all. But I'm not taking my chances with that silver dust in my tea when that never happened with a trusted brand tea kettle. It's going back. If they decide to use better quality steel on the inside this would definitely be my kettle of choice.

  I am so very happy with this little kettle!My last kettle had a very small opening to get the water in — this one is wonderful! It opens up big time and is very easy to fill. Plus,the marking on the inside make it easy to know where the maximum fill line is. Granted, it does not have individual cup markings, but since I make a pot of tea at a time, individual cup size is irrelevant for me. I do like that the on knob lights up. At first I was annoyed that the on knob was not metal, but when the light went on, oh, that’s when i changed my mind.Let’s talk about how fast it heats water. Whoa. That was a surprise! Hand’s down faster than my other kettle — which is now out in my studio to heat water for throwing on my wheel — it is quick! And I can touch the outside of the kettle and not burn myself, which is one of my greatest feats. I seem to be a magnet for burns. Now, I did pour the water a little too fast into the tea pot and the water splashed out and landed on my foot, but if I had been paying attention, that would not have happened. All in all I am quite happy with this kettle and also got the goose neck kettle for my hubby’s pour-overs! He loves it!

    nice looking, with stainless interior, but auto shutoff is problematic
  
",3.0,tremlabs,"Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  I like the way this pot looks and the double layer design.  The interior is all metal and does not have any plastic parts in contact with the water.  It boils fast, about 5-6 minutes to heat up a full pot.However, the automatic shutoff didn't work quite right for me.I found that when the water boils, the lid pops up a bit and forms a small gap, and so the steam tube does not detect the pressure change and shut off the boil.You can fix it by weighting done the lid with a coffee cup or a rock or or maybe a book of poetry you no longer have use for.The other problem is the base is very light and the cord (which is fairly heavy duty) lifts the base off the counter unless you weigh it down with something.

  We have been buying Electric Kettles for about 10 years now and this product is a great look and function for the price.  It is double walled so the water heats really quickly and keeps the water hot quite a long time.  It's a nice looking kettle and while you can't see the water level from the outside, the top opens wide so it is easy to view.  The price is about half of what I paid for my last kettle.  So overall, I recommend this product as a great buy.  I have a number of other products from this company and find them to function well and be priced just right.

  Overall I like the kettle but I have not had it long .  I have a milk frother by the same company and I love it so I have high hopes for this kettle.  I like the design. I don’t love the color.  I don’t hate it but I don’t love it.  The kettle is super easy to use as expected.  I followed the recommendation to boil water in it twice and dump it before the first use.  Both times I filled it halfway between the min and max fill lines.  It boiled the water in under 5 minutes.  The kettle stays cool to the touch. The thing I’m  not thrilled about I posted a picture of the inside of the kettle after the first use.  There are small dots now around most of the bottom.  I let the kettle cool completely for about 20 minutes before using it again to see if they went away and they did not.  I did not notice them there before I used it the first time so I’m not sure why it showed up from the heating device.  I don’t think it will impact the water but I’m not sure at this point.Overall I like it right now.  I will have to spend more time using it to really know for sure.

I am a morning tea drinker and up till now I had been boiling my water in the microwave. As an avid tea enthusiast, that's a big no no! I decided to take the plunge and order a kettle.

As suggested by other reviewers, I ran 2 cycles of water through the kettle to season it and bingo...it was perfection. Having tea from a tea pot rather than the microwave makes a HUGE difference in the flavor. I will warn you, the water is HOT, HOT, HOT so be careful. I highly recommend this product.

  This is an overall nice kettle. The design is pleasing with truly all stainless steel interior. It is not too heavy and is comfortable to pour. It heats up as fast as my other electric kettle so no complaints there. The light indicator at the bottom of the handle works well and is easy to turn on and off. My product did have some streaks, scratches and signs of use when delivered. Perhaps this was due to testing at the factory since the manual does state each kettle is tested by boiling water.

  This kettle works great and a bonus is that it looks really good.  I love the feature that you can wrap the cord underneath - I hate having extra cords out on the kitchen counter.  I use an electric kettle at least once every day for my chai.  Here in Arizona, the water is full of minerals - even though I have a water filter, the salts build up on the inside of the kettle so I have to clean it every few days and it's gross.  The electric kettles I've had in the past have metal tubing on the inside, which is basically impossible to clean around.  For me, the look of this one is great but the best feature is how easy it is to clean.  I'm really glad I switched to this one.  This is the 2nd thing I've bought from HadinEEon and I'm happy with their products.

  I use this electric kettle to make tea and it does just what I want it to. The outside appearance is attractive enough and the inside is stainless steel with a “max” and “min” water line on the inside. It heats the water fairly quickly, taking just a few minutes to heat about 20 oz of water. Overall I’m happy with this product as it does everything I expected it to.(Note: I don’t let the water get to a full boil where the kettle turns itself off. Instead, I keep the lid open while heating and I watch until the right amount of steam starts coming up and then I take it off.)

I conducted a test from start to finish to see how long it would take to heat up a full container of water. It took 5 minutes and 51 seconds to get hot water. Not bad at all.

  Super easy to use. You just pour water to the max line and turn it on. It turns off by itself when it's done boiling. It starts boiling within the first couple of minutes but I would say takes about 5 mins total to shut off. If you're impatient you can probably have very hot water 2 mins in. Either way, set it and forget it and you'll have hot water pretty quickly.

  Some things I love about this electric kettle: the look of this new model -- it looks great sitting on my countertop. The double-insulation keeps the water warmer longer than the glass kettle versions and also seems to heat up more quickly. Less plastic so less harmful chemicals potentially leaching into my water. There's no window for me to see how much water is in the kettle but it’s not a big deal for me since I always put in fresh water. Although the measurements are not labeled inside the kettle, the min line is .5 liters and max line is 1.5 liters. The spout is more rounded so there can be drips after pouring water from the kettle but if you put slowly, it’s not an issue. Overall, very satisfied with my purchase.

  This electric kettle is well made and has double wall. The exterior is cool to the touch, which is very safe when you have children around. It boils water very quickly, it takes around 1 min 40 sec to boil 16 oz of room temperature water. If you fill out to the kettle to the max (around 52 oz.), it takes about 6 minutes to boil. I am very happy with this kettle.

  I've had this kettle for 3 months and I use it to heat up water for morning beverages and for cooking. It's great quality for the price, easy to use, light, quiet, and aesthetically pleasing. The kettle heats water fast and you know it's ready when the automatic shut-off clicks off when done. The design allows for controlled pouring of water and you don't have to worry about burning yourself. The only improvement I would suggest is to make the base a bit heavier.

  I live in a small camper and use a generator for power. I limit my generator use and can only use one 1500w appliance at a time.The microwave and hot plate take much longer to heat water. The HadinEEon Electric Kettle has been a pleasure. It heats water in seconds. I can have coffee or tea, make pudding, jello, soup, instant potatoes, oatmeal, and a poached egg! The list goes on. So on a cold morning when I have to turn the heater off to make breakfast it takes far less time and the heat is soon back on.It takes up little space which there is little of in my camper. The pot conveniently comes off the heating pad without attachment.I also use the kettle's hot water to do dishes and take sponge baths.This kettle was a gift from a very smart friend.I will take this on all my travels. And would keep one in my home.Repectfully,Janet Jilote

With the auto shut-off I don't have to worry about waiting or watching.It definitely beats heating up water in a kettle on the stove. I boil water daily.

  I've purchased a few electric kettles over the years and this is definitely one of the top ones for the price. It's aesthetically pleasing with a matte white finish, and has a large capacity of 1.7liters. I like that it's tall, instead of short and stumpy as another one that I have. The matte white makes it look clean and more expensive than it actually is. It heats up the full 1.7l in just a few minutes, and the water remains pretty hot inside the kettle even an hour later. I drink hot/warm water at my desk all day long at work and love everything about this kettle. I have no cons for this and recommend 100%.

  I'll start by saying DON'T BUY THIS KETTLE, JUST DONT. Read further if you want to know why. My first one came damaged, but Amazon quickly replaced it. The hinge was stiff and didn't open completely. I thought it felt like good enough quality for the price. It's super cute. I was wrong. It's crap. I read other reviews saying how easily it rusts so I instructed my family to never leave water sitting in it. We are good about pouring out any extra water, we leave the lid open to dry it out, and usually use a hand towel to dry it. This ruins the purpose of this thing being convienent. It gets worse though. My daughter accidently left water sitting in it overnight. I came down the next morning to make tea and there were rust spots all over the bottom of the kettle. ONE NIGHT OF WATER SITTING IN IT AND IT RUSTED!!! I have had another kettle for 5 years that I have left water sitting in it for days on end and it NEVER RUSTED. Even with all our precautions with this kettle and keeping it super clean and dry it still got ruined. It's a piece of crap! I read reviews constantly to be sure before I buy something. Sometimes I ignore the few bad ones. Don't make the same mistake as me. Save your money and go elsewhere. These guys have great reviews because they give you a free product to leave them reviews. You'll get the same offer on a piece of paper with your product. I want my money back. I have dishonest companies. Learn from our mistake.

  This was a replacement for a very old electric tea kettle. Love that it turns itself off after it comes to a boiling point.That way if I get busy, I don't have to worry it will run dry.

  It works perfectly and heats up very quickly.  It also looks very stylish and modern on my countertop.  I drink a lot of tea so it’s used multiple times a day and has held up very well thus far.
