    Easy to Use Air Fryer
  
",5.0,CW,"Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  My grandkids have air fryers and have been telling me that my Tater Tots would cook better in an air fryer than in the oven. Well, I think they’re right. The air fryer is also quicker; the Tater Tots only took about 17 minutes from freezer to mouth. I chose this fryer because it’s cheaper than some of the fancier units offered. And I like the simple controls. Turn a couple of dials and you’re cooking. No buttons to press and no connection to my phone required. The “Bonus Cookbook” is just a few pages stapled together but has enough recipes to keep me going for a while. So far, so good!

  My first time ever buying an air fryer and after using this one I’m never using an oven again!!! Hands down the best addition to our kitchen. Cooked potatoes and salmon in it and they were better than using the oven. Not only that the clean up was easy! If you’ve been thinking of getting one of these don’t hesitate get it!

    Quiet air fryer
  
",4.0,Ashmomma,"Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  Everyone needs an air fryer! This replaced a different brand that broke down after 1.5 years of use. This one is so much quieter than the other one and it is a compact size to stay out on a counter top. We use ours several times a week so it stays out. Not a huge capacity but big enough for a family of four.

    Works well, love that the basket is dishwasher safe
  
",5.0,Hampton Reese,"Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  The air fryer is a new experience for me.  When I got this in the box and fryer was larger than I expected.  The fryer basket is pretty big, I think you could fit a  small chicken in it, which I plan to try.  My first attempt with this was to make french fries but I added way to many at once.  It took a couple tries but I've got it down now.  Everything thing I've cooked comes out crisp and tasty.  I tried ""frying"" a veggie patty in this the other day and it came out terrific, way better than the baked version.I still have some experimenting to do but so far I'd recommend it.  Also as mentioned in the headline, it's nice that the basket is dishwasher safe.  It's takes up a lot of space but when frying meat and other juicy things, it can get pretty messy.

  It’s very simple and easy to use just set the temperature and turn the Timer dial. We have fried  chicken wings a few times already, they came out crispy. It’s easy to clean and makes minimal noise when using.  The size is perfect for a small family of 2-3 ppl.

    Perfect for wings!
  
",5.0,Monica Villarreal,"Reviewed in the United States April 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  Received this air fryer last week and gave it a try today. Made some wings and they were pretty good. My first batch came out dry cuz I over cooked them. The second batch came out perfect. It will take you a few tries to get the hang of it but the product work as advertised. All of the grease falls to the lower chamber. It’s perfect for a low fat dinner.

    Wow what a great air fryer!
  
",5.0,Vic Can,"Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2021","









  
  
    
  We had purchased a small, economy air fryer to see what all the fuss was about. We were happy with the concept so we decided to finally upgrade. After a ridiculous amount of research and comparing, we chose this one for the following reasons. 1. There weren't any digital components that may be prone to burning up and failing. 2. The size was larger but not too big for the counter when using, and storing it away when not using it. 3. Great reviews. 4. Reasonable price.This thing is incredibly powerful and we love how everything we put in it has a nice, crispy exterior yet the insides are juicy, tasty and never dry or overcooked. We have used it for cheese sticks, steak fingers, stuffed chicken (frozen from Sam's Club) chicken nuggets and wings. We had to tone down the temps and times slightly because, as mentioned before, it's a powerful unit. The removable ""tray"" in the main basket is easy to clean and so is the basket. We didn't have a problem with a smell when we first cooked with it, but we did run it empty for 15 minutes at the highest temp and then ran the basket and insert in the dishwasher before using it for food. That may have helped.Get it, you won't regret it.

  I’ve only used this twice so far, but the results have been great. It’s very easy to clean. Unlike some other brands, due to the design, there is no need to worry that the basket and handle will come apart with hot food in it. I’m sure this appliance will get a lot of use.

",5.0,TMS,"Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  If you have never had a air fryer get one. Start with a simple small one like this one.  I gave it one star easy to clean because I don't have a dish washer.  If you have to scrub by hand it's kind of hard to get grease off needs soaking. It's really cool food comes out delicious healthy for you. Beware does not have removable basket and cooking time numbers are extremely small. I will be getting the next model up. This brand is the best. This one great for beginners.

  This is my 2nd air fryer by Ultrean, because I have a kitchette not because they aren't good air fryers. Air fryers don't need a lot to work so features and support are most important. I like this one more mainly because of its dials VS buttons. My other one the buttons fell inside and made it hard to operate. However, they sent me a brand new one for free as a result. You can make everything in an air fryer and theirs works great with great support.

    Bottom falls out
  
",3.0,stephanie arena,"Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2021","









  
  
    
  A WARNING, when you turn the pan over to dump your food out the bottom basket falls out with the food. I'm guessing this happens over time because the rubber pieces that keep the tray in seem to burn off as to where it's not safe anymore to dump food out without the tray falling out. I hope the company looks into this dangerous situation. Now I will have to look for another air fryer, one that is safe and easy to clean.

    Great first impression
  
",5.0,NVGeo,"Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  I’ve cooked every meal with this air fryer since it arrived yesterday... taquitos, 2 different chicken plates, salmon... so far I love it! It isn’t the same as frying, but in all the best ways. Flavor, juicy, crispy when needed. I was concerned this was just going to be another gadget but so far nothing could be further from my experience. No more than a tablespoon of oil, preheats to 400 in a minute, each meal has cooked in 10 minutes or less, easy clean-up. I’m very impressed so far!

  Great air fryer, Easy to use,  Easy to clean, leave the little rubber tabs in place on the drip pan in the bottom of the air fryer, as this was my first air fryer I wasn’t familiar and wasn’t sure whether to leave them or remove them but I left them in and it worked great,  when I later used another air fryer they had similar tabs on the edge of the drip pan.

    Loving my Airfryer
  
",5.0,Laura Parsons,"Reviewed in the United States August 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  Used it the night it arrived. Sweet potato fries and chicken. Fries, I gently wiped with olive oil and seasoned. Delicious. Chicken, went by recipe in book that came with it. Super easy. Very good also.Very easy clean up. Also, I was concerned it would be really hot like my toaster oven but it wasn’t to bad. The smell when I made my first meal was strong but I think that will dissipate. Oh...and I love that it’s not computerized. Easy!!

  This product is pretty good while it lasted, quiet and simple to use but only lasted for 4 month compared to 3 years on my old air fryer.  After several of using the dial doesn’t work properly so I have to use a timer while cooking or the food will burn. Will not recommend.Update:Based on my last product review, I was contacted by Mary and graciously offer to replace or issue a refund for the product so I decided to give it another try to use their product.  The company is sending me a replacement unit at no charge.  I'm trying a unit that has a digital screen this time instead of the time knob.  I'm looking forward to receiving the unit and give it another try.  I highly recommend to purchase from this company.  Outstanding customer service! Thanks again.

    a few scratches
  
",2.0,Mildred Gonzalez,"Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  Received item on date indicated, however, for something to be new it has a few scratches.  I will overlook this for now and try it out to see how well it cooks.  I followed the recommended times for chops and ended up having to double the time.  When I initially put 3 chops in at 350 degrees for 15 minutes that were still not cooked.  I then set them for 10 minutes at 400 (the highest temp it goes where others go up to 500) and the chops were crispy on the outside and dry on the inside.  So next batch I had to sacrifice crisp chops for moist juicy chops. Again, it will probably get returned as I found a deeper scratch in the area where the basket goes.

  I like the way this air fryer cooks, cook time are a little off if you follow the instructions, but you learn how to use it pretty fast, only reason I gave it a 3 is that it is very aromatic, the cooking smell stays around for hours, open some windows.

  I cooked pork chops and sweet potato fries, the pork chop was juicy and flavorful, I need a little more practice on preparing the fries but they still tasted good, I used too much oil to coat them (you really don't need very much). The fryer is quiet when cooking, it is super easy to program, the basket is easy to clean.  I'm very pleased with my purchase!

  This was my second air fryer purchase and I absolutely love it. It works great and is so much sturdier, quieter and easier to clean than my previous one, which was a different brand. Since the handle on my previous one totally broke off, an air fryer with a sturdy basket handle was important and this one certainly fulfills that. It heats up quickly and cooks evenly.  I'm so glad I decided on this one.

  This air fryer has made it so much easier to heat up leftovers like pizza and fries, and cook frozen foods to a crisp. It’s super easy to use (only two dials) so it’s perfect for beginners like me who don’t need any fancy functionalities. The only qualm I have is that it’s hard to clean in the sink (I don’t have a dishwasher) but I use parchment paper so I don’t need to clean it super often anyways.

  I really enjoy cooking and, unfortunately, I feel the need to acquire every kitchen gadget that comes down the pike.  This is one of the most ridiculous appliances that I’ve ever purchased.  First, it is very large and takes up a lot of storage space but has a very limited capacity  (I did not realize when I ordered it that there are others that have two cooking surfaces).  When it first arrived, I bought a large package of chicken wings, not realizing that the wings had to be cooked in a single layer not touching each other.  Since I had about 15 wings and the air-fryer would only hold about 5 or maybe 6 at a time, I decided just to bake them in the oven.  So, next attempt was a package of Ore-Ida Super Crispy Steak Fries.  I didn’t feel like getting the air fryer out of storage so I cooked 1/2 of the package in my regular oven according to package directions resulting in perfectly crisp fries.  A few days later I decided that I really had to try out the air fryer so I pulled it out of storage and cooked the other half of the potatoes according to package directions (360-d for 15 min, shaking once).  After 15 minutes it was obvious that the fries were not done.  Tried another 5 min, still not done.  After another 5, they appeared to finally be crisp and they were - at least on the outside. Unfortunately, they were not completely cooked inside.  In MHO, there is nothing that this appliance can do that a regular oven cannot do better.  Even the mid-sized toaster oven that I use on our boat has a larger capacity and does a far better job than this air fryer.  Unfortunately, I tossed the packaging before using it so cannot return.  I will donate it to a worthy organization although I regret having to fob it off on someone else.EDIT:  I was contacted by the company after they read this review -  they were extremely gracious and asked what they could do to make the situation right.  They are a great company and, while air-fryers are not for everyone (me), it is obvious by all the great reviews (on which I based my decision to buy one) that a lot of people love them.  This was, I believe the highest rated air-fryer that I saw and if you are interested in getting one, I definitely recommend doing business with these folks!

It has revolutionized the way I cook certain vegetables like broccoli and brussels sprouts.  It is easy to clean the basket.

    A Simple, no frills and easy to clean air fryer
  
",5.0,Andy,"Reviewed in the United States April 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  The Ultrean 4.5 quarter air fryer (Model AF02) is a great air fryer.Key pros:1. Makes great tasting food in a short amount of time. No electrical aftertaste in food even on the initial use of the air fryer. Not sure why I have to say that electrical aftertaste is not a thing, but I have used air fryers in the past where the electrical aftertaste never left the air fryer after 10-15 uses and I just ended up throwing the device out.2. Simple design (air fryers basically do 1 thing, run the air fryer at a certain temperature for a certain amount of time). This air fryer has two knobs, one from temperature and one for time.3. Easy to clean interior cooking/frying surface plate and oil drip basket. The surface plate removes from the basket and easy to clean with soap and a non-abrasive brush due to its non-stick coating. Since the surface plate can be removed, the underlying basket is fully accessible for proper scrubbing unlike many air fryers that tie the surface plate to the basket handle. Since these two pieces are isolated, it doesn't take too much space to leave these to dry after washing.4. Easy to clean exterior. Since there's not like 10 random preset buttons that I would never use, it's super easy to clean.5. Sufficiently long enough cord. It's not too short but it's not super long. The approximate length of the cord is 48-50in (~4ft)6. Not too loud for what it does. You'll definitely hear the fan whirring but you can still have a normal conversation over itSome considerations: (not worth knocking it down a star but worth knowing)1. Temperature and timer knobs are not digital so there is some eyeballing. Most things are forgiving to being 1-3 degrees off and 30s-1min off, but if you are cooking something sensitive to time/temp precision, I recommend using the timer on your phone to help remove one of the variables.2. It has a pretty tall profile. At 13.5in high, it will fit under most cabinets on the kitchen counter but a consideration is that reading the temperature knob might be a little harder for those who are shorter. Since it is mainly facing the ceiling

    EXCELLENT BUY FOR AN AIR FRYER
  
",5.0,Jocelyn,"Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  I found this air fryer when I was looking for something economical, not costing me hundreds of dollars and easy to use. I know some reviews can be bought so I went to consumer report and others to get some reviews for this Air Fryer. I have it for 2 weeks now and I am very pleased with this purchased. Not only that it fits perfectly under my kitchen cabinet it is also easy to use with just 2 knobs instead of numerous to push. So far I cooked chicken that turns out perfect and crispy and Fish yesterday and it turns out just perfect as I want it to be! The basket is soooo easy to clean too! I have no regret so far. This is my favorite kitchen gadget so far!!!

    Best air fryer
  
",5.0,mwhite,"Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  It doesn't have 12 different settings that make you guess how long and how hot to fry since all food will cook differently base on temperature of food (frozen or fresh), thick or thin, large or small, type of food, etc.  Instead of attempting have the appliance 'guess' at the time and temperature, once the 'cook' learns how to use for each different food, then this is the most simple and accurate fryer since the person cooking learns in a very short period of time how to simply choose time and temperature. This is a great feature of this fryer!  Simple, quiet, easy to clean, and seems like it will last a long time.  I looked at every air fryer on Amazon (yes it took quite a while) and thought about what the other manufacturers were marketing and saw the 11 presets! as a unnecessary 'feature"" that just drove up the price and complexity of a machine doesn't need this, in fact is a distraction at best.This one does give you general times and temperatures for a variety of foods, which is all you need and want.

  Super easy to use and clean!I was an COMPLETE airfryer novice, and the sweet potato cubes I made 1st thing came out DELICIOUS (I add rosemary to the salt/pepper/olive oil mix), and my veggie burgers are crisp on the outside & juicy on the inside... not dried-out mini-manhole covers!I recommend: 1). cooking a cut-up lemon before the 1st use to get out any factory smells (one lemon @ 400 degrees for 10 minutes), and, 2). using pre-cut, perforated parchment paper liners (available in every shape & size); makes clean-up a snap!**NOTE: the *recipes* included with the airfryer are pretty worthless, especially if you're a vegetarian, so I suggest either buying a cookbook for airfryers or looking stuff up online to get started :)SO NICE to have a healthy alternative to the microwave for smaller things, and ideal for 1-2 people!Just love it!HIghly recommended!

  I've considered purchasing an air fryer several times. My brother-in-law has one and loves it so I decided this was a good time to get one. The Ultrean 4.5 QT Air Fryer is great! The basket holds more than I expected and I find this very convenient to use. I haven't had an opportunity to use it on much yet but I have cooked frozen tater tots in it and was very pleased with the results. The tater tots were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. They didn't dry out the way they do when baked in the oven. We bought some chicken wings and will be trying those next!

    Quality Control?
  
",4.0,erz,"Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  Apparently there is a quality control issue with these air fryers, either that or they were mishandled by UPS. I bought 2 of them. The first one was very quiet. It worked, but it took twice the time as expected. On the second fan, the fan was stuck, so I replaced it (Thanks Amazon!!!). Now I received the replacement, more noise and cooks faster: I think that's the way it should be, so the first one was ""too slow"". I will ask for a replacement too.Other than that, they have a decent capacity, and look well made. The cooking is good.There was no padding at all in the boxes, so there is a change that they were damaged in the first shipment.

  The air fryer came in with the screw, lockwasher, and bracket that supports the heating element, laying in the bottom of the fryer. The mounting hole was stripped out, and the screw would not tighten. It was an easy fix for me, as I had small screws on hand, could see how it was originally installed. It may not be an easy fix for all.  With that out of the way, we soon used it to do french fries, while we fried fish and hush-puppies in a deep fryer. Since then we have also used it for mini-pizzas, croutons, brussel sprouts, and chicken. Although it's our first air fryer and we can't compare to other fancier models, we are very pleased with it.

  I dont know how I've lived my life without this magical gizmo in the kitchen. As an avid cook, the amount of time and mess the Ultrean saves me, while consistently churning out deliciousness is truly amazing. I've thrown in anything I can think of and a few shakes and minutes later, I have great food - not just fried food. This unit has effectively replaced the giant Whirlpool oven installed in my kitchen. I've used it to fry up frozen foods, and fresh veggies, meats, and seafood. It makes an amazing baked salmon, an astounding Sirloin steak (like literally ready in 5 mins with a couple of turnovers), great chicken anything (juicy, juicy breasts), epic shrimp, and the list goes on. It's also great for reheating stuff in a minute or two, without making it soggy like the microwave would - think grilled sandwiches, leftover pizza, etc. And it does all of this with low to no oil. A true gamechanger. I call my unit ""Rehoboam"" (Westworld reference). What do you call yours?PS: Yes, the heating element can make the occasional jangling, cranking noise for a couple of seconds when heating up or cooling down. Don't worry about it at all.

  I’ve had this a couple months now (I think, who knows with Covid!) and I love it. First air fryer and the size was perfect for me and my needs. I love making GF fried chicken tenders in this and regular old russet potatoes sliced thin with just some spices and a little spray of olive oil. Trader Joe’s cauliflower gnocchi also very good in it. Brussel sprouts I’m still trying to figure out. Roasted fennel omg so good! Easy to clean, sleek, quality! I didn’t want one with all the beeps, so I went manual. I encouraged my parents to order the larger model with the more automated features and they love it too. I highly recommend this brand!! The only thing was theirs was not wrapped in plastic so they think it may have been an (unused) return which is a little weird, especially right now.

  Had never had an air fryer before this one. Read the reviews and decided to give this one a try. Really love it and use it almost everyday. I have made fish, chicken, burgers, potatoes and this list goes on. This is a great appliance that I did not think was going to live up to the hype. If you have more than 2 people in your family, I would suggest getting a bigger air fryer. Since there only 2 of us this works perfectly. Very easy to clean. Only problem is the name on the front, Ultrean, have wiped off. I never use abrasives or anything like that, just warm soap and water but they have just about worn off. So other than that I have no complaints with this air fryer.

  I am on a learning curve in using this air fryer.  Everything I have fixed thus far, I have enjoyed. Salmon, Beyond Burgers, broccoli, zucchini, tater tots. What is a positive side is that it is so easy to clean.  I will continue to keep experimenting and enjoying.

  The air fryer works fast.  Only used for two meals so far.  Don't let the cook book listing fool you. At best it is a cook book pamphlet. Only a couple pages and some of the recipes are strange.

  No other appliance has affected my daily routine as much as this one, after weeks of comparing, this product seemed like the biggest bang for the buck and thankfully it has failed to disappoint thus far. I've cooked everything in it from veggies to chicken to New Yorks and ribs. It's a reliable, quiet and does its job, have only owned for two weeks so I'm hoping that does not change.

  Heats up quickly and evenly. If you use foil paper, make sure you use enough, sometimes my foil gets pulled up, especially if I have a lightweight item on top. I have learned to wrap items tight...if using foil. My wings are awesome! I place them in the air fryer, no foil, I love them crunchy and moist.

  This is my 3rd air fryer, I fall in love with them and pass them on to my kids to enjoy.  This one is not getting passed on, I love the size of the basket, it fits so much. Quiet running, does not emit a lot of heat on the outside of fryer. I keep it on a marble cutting board to insure that any heat does not damage my counter top.  Clean up is a breeze.  Instructions did say to cut a lemon in half and cook this in the fryer first to help the fryer burn off any factory chemicals.  I did this and it really helped to clean off fryer for first time use  I have purchased 7.5 inch parchment sheets from amazon to place in the bottom of the fryer to ease in clean up.This fryer is a must have for anyone that is buying an air fryer.

  This air fryer has changed my life! I'm not the greatest cook but with this little guy and Pinterest, I'm unstoppable!!! And the fact that I can make a BLT without preheating the oven or manning a frying pan and making a mess, is heavenly! I would love to have one a little bigger but due to couter space restrictions, I went with this dude. The basket and tray are also super easy to clean. Someone had mentioned in the reviews to not let the tray soak cause the holes would start to rust, so I never leave it to soak for more than a couple mins. and I've had no issues.

  So far it works really well and is super easy to clean. Only been using it for a few weeks so can't guarantee its longevity, but happy with it so far. My only recommendation is be super careful with the basket insert if you're leaving it in the sink before cleaning it. If it sits in any water, the little metal bit in the middle can get a bit of rust on the ends. So don't leave it soaking. But it cleans up super nice in the dishwasher, so I'm happy for that.

  So happy with this item. Big enough to fit an entire quartered chicken. Have made chicken thighs, a whole chicken, fries and potato wedges so far and all turned out amazing. Super easy to clean and it saves lots of time and energy. I read that you should heat up your air fryer first before putting food in which wasn't in the instructions. Would recommend for 2 people!

  I received an air fryer that had been previously used and not cleaned before being sent to me. There is oil and food crumbs inside the air fryer. Very disappointed with this purchase.

  Awesome when you don’t want to heat up the oven. This is basically a hot air oven, quicker and faster to cook certain items especially French fries. But I recommend not filling up the basket more than half full for a all around crispy fry.

  I purchased this air fryer for my husband for Xmas because he wanted one for a long time.  We absolutely love the convenience, easy clean up and ability to “fry” much healthier. The vegetables are our favourite which was a surprise. We had a small issue with the basket and ultranationalist sent a whole new air fryer.  Highly recommend this product and the service we received.

  Large basket fits enough  for two servings of meat and potatoes. Cooks quickly and food is crispy and tasty. Best new kitchen small appliance in a long time. Heats up quickly. My old toaster oven has been replaced!
