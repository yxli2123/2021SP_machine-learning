  There's nothing less than a five star for this product.  I bought it for my wife because of a cousin referral, and let me retell you there's nothing out there that has given me more husband points than this. A little behind the scene: my wife got an allergic reaction on her cheeks, and forehead which started to breakout in her face and no medicine, or antibiotics reduced it, calm it down or took it off.  As a husband I can see her frustration everyday with going from a perfect smooth face to this breakout. She used a derma roller together with this product and I kid you not in three days I've seen so much of it go down, and a big smile coming out.  Now we know that is a matter of time before it all goes away and her face goes back to baby bum smooth. Hahaha!!! That you TruSkin. For the fast shipping, and great product ... and of course the husband points !! ;)

  I truly believe that it‚Äôs a myth that you have to spend a fortune on skin care to see results.  I have tried many different Vitamin C serums at all different price points, and I really believe that TruSkin is the best on the market.  My skin looks brighter, feels smoother and I get compliments all the time.  Although most people think I‚Äôm much younger, at 68 I needed something that was really going to make a difference and TruSkin is just that.  Don‚Äôt think twice about ordering a bottle, just do it!  You‚Äôre going to love it!

  Man oh, man where do I start. I have been struggling with blemishes and acne for years now and can say that I have tried possibly everything and nothing really gave me the results that I was looking for until I found this baby right here. This basically pure skin love in a bottle, I follow a routine every morning and night and this is apart of my routine of smoothing out my skin and even brightening up the blemmishes that are basically almost completely gone now. I am so happy that I choose this product and look forward to being a long time customer forever. Definitely recommended

    Just doesn't work

  I normally never really leave bad reviews but this serum really just didn't do it for me. I read all of the reviews and was hoping it would work as well for me as it did for everyone else. I'm so sad I just finished up my bottle and towards the end I was really realizing it was not having any effect on my skin, but I had bought the serum as a gift before realizing it was no good. I also recommended it to my sister who bought it shortly after me and has also come to the same conclusion that it just doesn't work. I'm on day two of the Pacifica brand sea salt and vitamin c and I can immediately tell the difference between the two serums this one is working 20 times better I feel like my face is so soft and smooth and I can also see dark spots literally disappearing. So sorry to say this product does not work

  I have battled dyshidrotic eczema on my palms for over a year. I have been prescribed topical steroids and specialized lotions. I have tried all kinds of diet adjustments and supplements. Most have had minimal effects. I read a review of this product about how the purchaser had smoother hands now after applying the product. I gave it a try and finally my hands have returned to normal. It's taken about a month for my hands to completely heal. If you are are almost out of remedies. Give this product a try.

    Prone to Red Patchiness/Flare-ups, Seeing Results After a Month, Highly Recommend!
  
",5.0 ,Taylor H.,"Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2018","









  
  
    
  I'm 22 years old, and I FINALLY realized that taking care of your skin was very important, and meant applying cleanser, toner, a serum, and moisturizer every night, rather than just washing your face with soap in the shower. I never had acne-prone skin, or cystic breakouts, but I would have the occasional hormonal flare-up that would give me a couple whiteheads on my face. I am also very pale, and am prone to developing red patchiness as the days goes on. When I was browsing serums that could reduce dark spots from a some pimple scars, as well as reduce red patchiness, I came across this brand, and immediately bought it. From the various 5 star reviews, I knew I had to try it out on my skin. Now, a month after I bought it, I am seeing amazing results. Sure, it does not magically get rid of your hormonal flare-ups, but it does reduce their intensity, and leaves my face bright, refreshed, and clean feeling every morning. I highly recommend this product because I am seeing results, and have been complimented on my great skin recently!

  I wish I did a before and after photo. My skin wasn't terrible, but I had a few problem areas (hyperpigmentation and dark circles under my eyes). I have been using this product for about a week and I can already see a noticeable difference. It did exactly what I wanted it to do, and I can still use my favorite moisturizer on top of it (not from TruSkin, and not a dig at theirs, I just haven't tried theirs). This serum is definitely worth the $20 if you have any of the issues I mentioned. You don't need an expensive chemical peel, or whatever else you've read about.

  I've been in the market for a good serum for awhile. After trying out a few, including some high end brands that cost me well over $100 and didn't quite deliver, this will be the serum I stick with. My skin absorbs it really quickly, and I somehow feel as if my moisturizer goes deeper into my skin when I apply it after the serum. I've noticed a positive change in my skin tone, which used to be patchy and red, but is now much more smooth and clear after having used this serum for about 2 weeks. Also have to make a note about the great customer service - I had a few questions about their product line, and questions were answered personally and directly to my specific questions. I'm a very happy customer and am looking forward to trying out the other products in their line!

  As soon as I got the product, I got detailed instructions on how to use it via email. It works perfectly and so far I can already see results with my face looking brighter and more awake. I will definitely be purchasing again since I've been eyeing vitamin c serum for some time and did not know where to start and saw amazing reviews for this online and here and decided to go with it. I've only had it for a day and so far my face feels smooth, also feels like it's tight in a good way and I noticed after I slept that my face didnt look tired. I will edit my review later to show other results but so far no issues with this vitamin c serum.

  I have amazing skin. I was looking for something to brighten it. Since using it, I have a black line appear on my cheek. I spoke to a dermatologist and they said what ever this serum contained, he reacted poorly with my skin and made it more sensitive to sun damage. Not I have to use a skin whitener to correct the damage caused. It made my skin feel so tight and unmovable as if I had elmers clue on my face and it dried.  And the packaging was crap.

  I purchased for my daughter who‚Äôs going through puberty. She has some face and back acne scarring. Based on the reviews, I purchased with excitement for her.She has been using this once a day everyday for over a month, no changes. So far, I feel this is a sham, it doesn‚Äôt work at all.Starting today we are going to start doing it 2x a day and I‚Äôll post an update at the end of this month, Dec.Update 1/6:After posting my original review, customer service reached out and offered me a refund or their Vitamin C Cleanser to use in conjunction with this. After about two weeks of using the Vitamin C Cleanser, I noticed her face acne scars have lightened a bit. She said she doesn‚Äôt see much of a difference, but I do. She continues to use both products every night before going to bed and it seems to be working, to me. (I‚Äôll post before and current pics soon.)No matter the outcome, I am very pleased with the customer care provided. They respond to all my emails and concerns. They do what they say they will do and never asked me to post a positive review, like many others have. If these products work for my daughter‚Äôs back acne scars, OMG, I will post another update and I will not be able to sing their praises enough! They are very nice, responsive and understanding. I pray, this work so I don‚Äôt have to deal with anyone else ü§ûüèæ

  Having been a long-time user of a luxury medi-spa brand, I just always purchased my 'usual' brand that my esthetician would recommend, and sure, I was happy with it. However, I also one day noticed how much money I was spending on this particular luxury brand...so I decided to do something about that. I always check and read customer reviews, and felt good about trying this brand. TruSkin Naturals appealed to me since it was a natural product, and also contained the Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E I was looking for. So, after using this product for about 3 months? The price is about 70% less per bottle than what I was paying for my luxury medi-spa brand, and my skin feels wonderful, rejuvenated and smooth. The customer service from this company is incredible and I am a convert! You will not be disappointed with this serum - even if you currently use the super fancy (costly) serums. Do yourself a favor and get this product, take yourself out to lunch with your savings and have a glass of wine to celebrate how smart you are!

  I am thriled with this product.  I actually discovered the use of Vit. C in skin products through another brand which is much more expensive. It did work pretty well in softening my age lines. So I decided that,  trying a new product using that same ingredient, might be a good idea.  I chose Tru Skin Vit C.  I am 82 and the lines from my nose down to my chin are considerably less deep!  I had a crese above my nose and between my eyebrows. It is gone!!  Other lines on my face are a bit less deep.  At my age, I know that nothing will erase wrinkles -  but this product has certainly improved my appearance!  And at a great price!Love it!!!!

I had zero bad reactions to the test spot.After 3 weeks of using the serum on my face and neck daily it has made these differences:-smoother skin-reduced dryness-reduced under eye circles, puffiness-reduced appearance of fine linesI'd recommend anyone to add this serum to their facial care routine.

  Before college, my skin never broke out horribly. I would only get a pimple or two before my period but other than that, my skin was perfectly fine. However, once college started, I started breaking out badly and the pimples I would get were those hard ones that never surfaced a white head. I got a huge pimple on my nose in December and the dark coloring is still here six months later. I researched and found out that vitamin C serums were supposed to help with fading dark spots so of course, I came on amazon and bought the one with the highest reviews. Needless to say, this product did not work with my skin. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the brand or just vitamin c (hence why I didn‚Äôt give it a 1 star), but my asian skin just would not react to it. I used the serum every night after my toner and before my face bask, adding a drop to my left cheek, a drop to my right cheek, and a drop on my forehead and massaging it to my face. The existing scars did get better but it‚Äôs still there and I don‚Äôt know the extent that this product really helped me. My face is still horrible and dry.

  I love this product! It is hydrating, absorbs quickly, and has helped keep dry patches at bay without being oily and heavy. It is gentle enough to use on sensitive acne-project skin, and is light enough to wear under makeup during the day without having a negative interaction with my foundation (doesn't cause it to break up, become oily, or smear). Texture wise, it feels like a makeup primer. I was surprised that it didn't have a citrus scent like most other vitamin C products - it has a neutral scent, doesn't really smell like anything - but the performance of the product is exceptional and no added scent is honestly a nice change in a world of cosmetics and skincare with so many overly scented products, so it doesn't bother me at all.I would also like to add that the TruSkin Naturals customer service is fantastic! I received an email from an actual person as soon as this item had shipped letting me know some information about the product and to offer any support with questions. I have since communicated with this rep a few times about their product line, and she is responsive, knowledgeable, and helpful :)

  This product is amazing!  It only took two weeks for me to see visible results.  I presume after 3 months, the result will be dramatic.  I have problems with dark spots on my face due to early sun exposure.  My skin is also very sensitive and it gets irritated easily.  This serum made my skin look and feel better almost immediately.

  First of all let me start off by saying this is my second bottle of this serum. Here‚Äôs my story so you can understand a few things and reasons why I‚Äôm a customer for life. I‚Äôm a 34 yr old woman, who has endometriosis and PCOS. I don‚Äôt take birth control because although it gave me porcelain doll skin, everything else that happened to me while on birth control was miserable. It helped control my hormonal acne, and it helped me lose a lot of weight. I have been off birth control a full 3 years now. I have always had what I felt was ‚Äúdecent‚Äù looking skin. I had a bit of teenage acne growing up but never much where I felt I had to slab make up on every day. Now at 34, with cystic ovaries, I had to change things up in my routine. I started doing research and I‚Äôve always liked and leaned towards things that were more natural with less alcohol and other horrible ingredients just bad for your skin. After my research of serums, toners and supplements. I chose TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C Serum. The fact that it also has vitamin E and Hyaluronic acid is major plus. The vitamin E is also great for helping scars face and help fight against aging as well. The thickness and consistency of the serum is matched perfectly. It is not greasy nor oily. I use a dropper full amount for my whole face and entire neck. My acne scars are mostly on my neck and it‚Äôs embarrassing. Having to wear make-up all the way down to my shoulders almost is horrible. With the bottle I noticed very quickly within less than a week that my fine lines faded, my acne not only basically cleared up but the scars did too. I kept getting compliments at work and from my patients and they asked what I used on my skin because it looked like a doll‚Äôs face. They would tell me my skin looked soft and smooth and it was. I Told them I use the TruSkin Vitamin C serum, along with Burt‚Äôs Bees Chamomile and Soap bark face wash. I have continued to have amazing results until hurricane/tropical storm Harvey hit. We lost half of our patients due to them losing everything as well and some relocated and others we don‚Äôt know. There was a company lay off and being someone who loves and is passionate in skin care and I‚Äôm a nursing student, and while trying to reach out about working from home to make it easier with my studies, I went to the actual TruSkin company site and sent a message asking about possible employment. The site and I believe business owner, Erica, responded kindly and so sweet. I had actually forgot I had sent that message at the time of the reply and the worst part was it looked like I was drunk while typing it. I lost my glasses from the flooding. Anyways, although she was unable to offer employment she was beyond so kind and compassionate and understanding during our correspondence and I was offered a free bottle of the serum to help compensate and I was so excited. I‚Äôve never had that happen to me and I told her pretty much all I‚Äôve said here on my long winded story. When I temporarily stopped using TruSkin Vitamin C serum due to Harvey my skin flipped out on me. I know it‚Äôs from stress and hormones. I received my bottle of serum yesterday and my bottle of the retinol moisturizer today. It‚Äôs crazy to say that the results are already amazing. I have sensitive skin. The serum feels amazing, the moisturizer feels great. It smells soft and no burning or stinging. I‚Äôll update soon with pictures as promised. Thank you Erica, for the kindness you showed me and for having these amazing and natural products. I hope to use these as long as I can. Because just after a day and a half my skin has already shown the softness and smooth skin I had before that I received so many compliments on.

  UPDATE: After I posted my original review, I was contacted by customer service and was offered a full refund and a new product from a different line based on a recommendation by the agent. I was very pleased with this but they did ask me to update my review to reflect dealing with their customer service team. I don't have any problem with that because they were very kind to deal with and didn't make any excuses, but I will not be changing my original rating of 2 stars because the original product still didn't work for meORIGINAL: To start out, I've never had any major acne, just a few minor pimples here and there mostly on my nose and chin. The problem is I tend to pick at them, making them scar. I bought this to help with acne scarring and even my skin tone. I had read reviews about how it got rid of acne scars in less than 6 months, which I thought was amazing. I wanted to get rid of some scarring for an upcoming trip. I bought this and tested it out on my arm and neck to make sure I wouldn't break out, which all turned out fine. Well I started using it on my entire face and after about a week, I noticed some new pimples that were under the skin on my cheeks and forehead (all places I had never had acne before). I thought it was just my face getting used to the product but after another week, more acne started to appear and it was on my chin now as well. It was almost like cystic acne because it was so deep under the skin and caused my skin to become bumpy. I stopped using this for about a week, and my face started clearing up immediately. I had high hopes for this product, but sadly it didn't work out. On the plus side, the smell is good.

So I was hoping this would help with my face since I seen all the good reviews on it, however, when I received the bottle it look like it might have been sitting for awhile because the words were coming off the bottle. Also the color and cloudiness of the serum looked as maybe it was expired. I might have just gotten an old bottle idk but I think I'm going to ask for a refund, because I don't feel comfortable using this on my face.

  I discovered TruSkin in 2018.I had really bad chin acne that almost seemed like a yeast. I couldn't get rid of it. I tried lots of products and nothing worked, it seemed most products made it worse. I can't remember how I found this product, I just know I have used it ever since I first ordered it. It has greatly improved my skin. Chin acne is gone and I feel more confident now. The product is fragrance free and is easily applied. I use it after a shower. I highly recommend this to anyone who has stubborn acne that won't clear up.

  I am someone who loves to take care of her skin, but I am also very impatient. I have tried several different face products to reduce premature wrinkles and have better skin; however, over the years, most products have been unsuccessful or a waste of my money. Staying hydrated helps, but I wanted something that I could use at night or in the daytime. Luckily, I found this! This is the first product that I've used that has caused SIGNIFICANT results within about a week of using it. The results were NOTICEABLE, and I found my skin becoming more smooth, clear, and even. I was hesitant because of the price, but the product lasted me for a month and a half. So, I will be a continue to buy this due to the immediate results! I even went out of my way to recommend this product to a few friends, who saw results quickly (within a week, just like I did!). Obviously, everyone's skin is different and this product may not work for you... But, I highly recommend trying it for yourself before dismissing it completely. The customer service is also very kind! So, if you have any issues with the product, I'm sure they will be pleased to help you any way possible. :-)

  I‚Äôve been using this product for years with no results.  I‚Äôve purchased 3 bottles and used to the end.  It feels great on skin and is a good moisturizer but that‚Äôs it.  It‚Äôs spot reducing claims are meh at best.  After reading more about Vit c this product should really be in an air tight container as to prevent degradation. Vit c is so sensitive that the constant exposure to air this product gets breaks it down almost immediately.  Maybe with that small change the spot reducing/removing claims would be one more attainable.

  Above all, I would like to say that the customer service I have experienced ordering this product is nothing short of exceptional!  I have worked in customer service for 20 years and am very passionate about both giving and receiving it.  It is clear to me that TruSkin genuinely cares about their customers.  I don't leave reviews often unless the customer service or product was extremely good or extremely bad.  With that being said, I have not had any issues and am extremely satisfied with the product and as I mentioned the customer service.  My skin is clearer and brighter than I have ever seen it and I get constant compliments on how my skin glows.  It is important when using this product to be patient and consistent.  Give it some time to see some results....at least a month.  As I mentioned, using the serum consistently is just as important if you want to see results.This is a great quality product, that is also affordable AND comes with exceptional customer service.  You can't go wrong with this serum!

  It took my skin a minute to adjust to this product but it's definitely helped my skin look healthier. I've had fewer breakouts and overall my face looks smoother. I think it's even helping acne scars. I cleanse, use a witch hazel toner, then the serum, sometimes salicylic acid and always moisturize. The only other big addition I added that was also helpful is a Aztec clay mask twice a week. I've been using the serum since the end of March and have pretty dramatic results despite hormonal breakouts.

  The company is great and I do well with their hylauranic acid but CAUTION use this sparingly and not frequently. (If you have sensitive skin) Too much can give a reaction. Took me a minute to figure out where reaction was coming from. My gf told me to get this. I think because it‚Äôs strong I just need to give myself a break. My gf explained my skin was turning over at too fast of a rate and she gets blotchy too if done too much so now she only uses acids 1-2 x per month. I think moving forward after my skin calms down I will try on different part of my body in a patch test and hopefully will be ok. I was reading that reactions happen 12-72 hrs post useage for reactions so keep that in mind for patch testing. I hope this helps! :0)

  When I saw all the rave reviews, the cynical part of me was sure it was a scam... that most of the reviewers were paid. But I'm happy to say, I was proven wrong. I've been using this product for less than 3 weeks, and I don't think my adult skin has ever looked better. I'm in my early 30s and I've been dealing with acne since I hit puberty. After using this serum, I do still get little zits (mostly from wearing a mask 1/2 the day), but the constellation of red dots along my left cheeck that I thought were acne scars are now 98% gone!! I honestly can't believe it. They've been there for years and now they've vanished after just 2 weeks of using this product. Besides the drastic reduction in acne, the overall quality of my skin is just better. I've NEVER looked in the mirror and thought my skin looked ""dewy""... until now. I'm kicking myself for not trying a product like this before. I've tried quite a few acne-specific products and none of them were worth keeping around. I honestly thought nothing short of a laser would fix my skin. But here I am. Dewy AF.I wouldn't call this product ""moisturizing"". My skin feels a little tight after applying it. But after I put my moisturizer on, it feels great. I started out just applying it at night, but when I really began to see the results after the first week, I started applying it twice a day.

    Important part of my regimen!
  
",5.0 ,Customer,"Reviewed in the United States November 12, 2017","









  
  
    
  1.5 months of useBefore (top), After (bottom)UPDATE: 4 months of use (next picture)Overall impression:This has been a key ingredient to my morning routine; the Vitamin E + Hyaluronic acid additions are a plus. The very first time I applied this on to my face, there was a burning sensation which is normal for skin that hasn't used potent vitamin C. To achieve the most successful results, you must be careful with what other ingredients you're mixing this with because some will make it less effective (do your research before mixing products!). In addition, you must use it while it is not oxidized. You can tell by assessing its color: the more pigmented, the less effective. The after result picture is not solely due to the Vitamin C serum, but rather the result of my entire morning and night regimen that I've carefully created to target post-inflammatory pigmentation; however, when I added this serum to my routine, I noticed greater improvements in skin texture and complexion.Incorporated as part of my routine:Vitamin C is a great protective antioxidant so I use it once a day in the morning after cleansing my face with a niacinamide-containing face wash and toning it with Thayer's witch hazel rose petal toner. After applying the serum, I let it sink into my skin, which is usually about when I feel that my face has become a bit tight where I can feel a slight film of the serum. The last step of this mourning routine is applying a sunscreen with SPF 50.Amount of product used:I'm quite generous when it comes to application of this serum because Vitamin C quickly oxidizes causing it to lose its potency. I went through my first bottle in 1 month and I'm currently on my second one.

  These are some of the things I have noticed since I started using the product. I am starting to notice that the crows feet around my eyes have become less noticeable; in fact, someone who has known me for years who is close to my age commented that, their eyes did not look as good as mine. I also have noticed that I had a few blackheads on the tip of my nose that are definitely smaller, however, I am also using a clay mask, three times a week, in the morning to help with that area so, I believe they are working in tandem; and I am reaping the benefits! I have never had any results until I started using your product and the clay.In general, I have been blessed with good genes and pretty nice skin to where I never have and hope to never need to use foundation or blush.  Having this product makes me happy to know that I feel I can continue not worrying about that.  Many people ask me what I use, and I proudly tell them nothing; except your product and a moisturizer.Anything in particular you like about it?In particular, I like how it does not interfere with my daily face cream; and, it is mostly organic as well.It easily and quickly absorbs into my skin. I am using it twice a day. It was suggested that one use a sunscreen when outside using the Vitamin ""C"" in  sunlight. I had not considered that.The only thing that is a negative I noticed was:1) When I try to put a creamy concealer on under my bottom eye lids, instead of a smooth look, it looks stringy.  Should I not use it under my eyes?  Be certain the Serum is completely dry and do not use too much under the eyes.2) Recently, I noticed that sometimes along my cheekbones, under the eye area, it appears very shiny. Any tips for that or do I avoid that area because I use this product all over my face.  I even use it on my neck and decollete and after it dries I moisturize these areas as well.Again, 3-4 drops is suggested to use, but spread quickly to get coverage all over the face and under and over the eyes.Other than that, I love the product! I want to finish this bottle and I will probably get several other products from the line; and of course--another ""C"" Serum.

  I wanted to wait a bit before writing this review to see if this serum lived up to the hype I've read on Amazon's reviews.It's a nice, light serum, and when it dries, you CAN feel your skin tightening a bit. I've been using it now for about 2 1/2 weeks, and while I have seen some improvement in my skin tone (a bit clearer & smoother), I wouldn't necessarily call this a ""holy grail"" product. You can buy great Vitamin C serums from a lot of different vendors here on Amazon--- The Ordinary sells FANTASTIC skincare at really reasonable prices, for example. If you're looking for good skincare that does work pretty well, this is a good bet. You DO have to hang in there.... the first week I saw no change at all... the second week, it started to improve, but my skin did go through a ""learning"" period, I guess you could say, where it broke out a bit with this. It wasn't horrendous, though. Overall, I'd say this is a GOOD serum--- ""holy grail"" quality?? Not really.

  This product actually works!  I've tried so many products to lighten my dark spots on my face.  Bobbi Brown, Chanel, Lancome, Givenchy, Mario Badescu and I'm sure many more!  I googled best Vitamin C for your skin and this popped up.  I read the reviews and ordered it.  The first month I didn't see a lot of difference in fact, I had a bit of itchy reaction to it.  Erica, from TruSkin emailed me and asked how it was going with the new product.  I told her I felt I wasn't seeing a difference.  So she offered to send me a second bottle free of charge.  I got the second bottle...I kept using it day and night as Erica instructed.  I no longer had the itchiness and at the end of the second bottle, I looked in the mirror and a dark patch that I had on my face since my first daughter was born (20 years) was gone!  Seriously...gone.  I wasn't even paying a lot of attention to see it fade...it was just gone....honestly I couldn't believe it.  I know there's no miracle for anti aging unless your Cindy Crawford, but this worked!!  I was so happy!!!  I've ordered my third bottle and ordered the retinol.  I also got my mother and best friend to order it.  I'm in marketing folks, so I understand the gimmicks, I understand the propaganda...but TruSkin did what it said and  Erica was supportive and provided the best customer service I've had in a long time....I would order this and dedicate yourself to using it.  You may not see results right away, but you will see results.  I'm still amazed that a product worked exactly like it said it would!!!

  Ive looked into (and bought) several serums and ""supposed"" instant result skin creams and serums and haven't been too pleased by most. After I purchased the Vitamin C serum made by TruSkin I noticed a significant change in the way my skin felt and looked. I use it with another hyaluronic acid serum, but I love this product. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin so I was afraid to use anything new in fear of reaction, especially hyaluronic acid, but I haven't had any bad reactions at all and my face feels hydrated without the use of an added moisturizer! The cost is great and being a skeptic from previously failed products I didn't believe a few drops would really cover my whole face and neck, but it really does. I would definitely recommend this product as well as purchase from TruSkin in the future. Their customer service is also fantastic. Within just a few days of receiving it I was contacted (by a real person) to see how it was working for me. So, long story short, if you're looking for high quality, affordable skin care products with great customer service look no further!*By the way...I am in NO WAY paid or compensated by my statement just to be clear. I'm just a normal Woman who wants to pass on the word of products that really work in a Sea of those that don't!

  I purchased this serum to use along with a Derma Roller.  I also purchased and use a firming serum. I'll include links for both of those products, also.  Since starting to use the combination of products, I've noticed that my skin feels more hydrated, looks less red and blotchy, and feels more firm.  I've also noticed a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles.  I use this serum on my entire face, including right under my eyes and on my crow's feet.  I haven't had any reactions to this product even though I tend to have a lot of eye allergies. My skin does feel a little sticky after putting the serum on my face. However, it goes away after a few minutes.  I'm happy with the results I've seen so far, and I will continue to use the combination of products.

  I read all the glowing reviews, I can only think now that they were free testers. This was definitely not worththe $20  I spent. I tried it exactly 12 days thinking if I gave it time it would start working. I didn't see any glow, I actually started gettinf acne when I rarely have the occasional pimple. On the 13th day I accidentally brushed the bottle mid application and the glass shattered all over my sink. I had no choice but to throw it away but I didn't feel bad because it probably needed that. I bought the Neutrogena serum with the hydraulic acid-immediate results, acne clearing after one application!!! Like this one should have been! Very disappointed in this purchase.

  UPDATED DEC. 14/19I gave this product 3 stars back in November. As usual, I wasn't expecting to hear back from the seller. To my surprise, I was contacted in less than 24 hours by Erica. Not only that TruSkin refunded the whole price and let me keep the product ( I didn't ask for any of this), but they asked me how my skin is to help me find a product that may work better. I replied, and they sent me a full size of a less concentrated vitamin C to try for free. (Again, I never asked for any of these. It didn't event crossed my mind... and No, nobody offer me anything in exchange for my opinion).I understand we all have different kinds of skin, this serum may not be for me, but if so many people swears by it, it may work for you as well.  In any case, please give TruSkin a try, they truly stand behind their products.________________________________________I started applying this serum + TruSkin retinol about a month ago and haven't noticed any difference.. I tried to use it once at night without the moisturizer, and my skin felt dry and itchy. Since the reviews in Amazon are so good,  I gave it another try by itself on another day, but same thing happened.  My skin was so itchy I had to wash it throughly.  Besides those two instances, I haven't seen any bad reactions on my skin (as long as I use it with the Retinol cream), so I plan on finishing the little bottle to see if I get any results.

  After a lot of research, I decided to purchase this serum. For the reasonable price in comparison to some that sell for $50+, I am glad I chose this as the first serum that I have ever bought! Acne is not as big of a concern to me as dehydration and texture are. What I love about this serum is that it helped give my skin the moisture it needed without making my t-zone any more oily than what it was to begin with, as well as smoothing it out!I loved adding this to my morning and night skincare routine. I start by using Cerave cleanser, The Body Shop Tea Tree Oil, Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Stress Control Tone rat night, Thayers Witch Hazel Aloe Vera Toner in the morning, this serum, and then Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Moisturizer Gel-Cream. This skincare routine has helped my skin a lot! I have combination skin type and acne that usually flares up before/after my period and during stressful times.I know this has been an earful to read, but if you're like me, I love reading other people's skincare routines so I can find what works the best!

  I have the kind of skin where anything leaves a scar. I could scratch my chin and wake up with a scar, so as imagine, this product had its work cut out. I've been using the product for about 2 months and I have noticed SIGNIFICANT improvements to my scarring. I use it twice a day. All my scarring isn't gone, but I feel so much more confident. I no longer have to cake on super heavy foundation (and reapply later to keep my scarring from showing). I've even gone out in public with foundation (can't even tell you when I've done that before). I am glad I have added this product to my skincare routine and I'm excited to continually see improvements to my skin.The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it is a tad drying, and I did break out some at first. That being said, I already have extremely dry skin to begin with and it isn't uncommon that my skin breaks out when I add a new product.

  So I was super scared to try this because some people claimed some of the reviews were paid for, which I‚Äôm not sure if they were or not, but anyway I almost didn‚Äôt buy this because of that. Then last minute I decided I was gonna buy it and try it anyways. So I did :). Before I say anything I want to say this, it drys out your face!! If you use, moisturize! Okay back to my review, so at first I honestly didn‚Äôt notice a difference. But to be fair. I have super clear skin, I‚Äôve never struggled with acne, I only get like a pimple every now and then, so it‚Äôs difficult to judge for me. But I kept using it with my normal routine (I‚Äôll put that at the end). I didn‚Äôt notice a real difference for a while other than my face looked a little brighter, but it wasn‚Äôt breaking out my face so I kept using it. Well I forgot about it for a few weeks and stopped using it. Then last weekend I had a bad breakout on both sides of my face from wearing my mask (the first 3 pics are of thatüòñ). I never get breakouts like this so it scared me. Well that night I went home, washed my face, put the serum on, moisturized, and by the next morning my face already was pretty clear. I still had like 2 pimples, but it was BAD and over night it cleared up so well! Since then I‚Äôve made sure not to skip a night! Again remember I don‚Äôt have a sensitive face or acne, so our experiences with it could be very different.That last picture is me today, 5 days later, with a little make up. My face is clear again thankfully!!Here‚Äôs my routine for my face for reference:1. Wash with face wash: I use Biore Rose Gold face wash and wash my face while in the shower2. Dry Face3. Put on Vitamin C Serum.I put just enough to cover my face.Remember this serum drys out your face!!4. MoisturizeI like Cetaphil. I always moisturize, but do it for sure if using the serum because it will dry out your face.Every morning I take vitamins and throughout the day I drink 8 bottles of water. This helps so much more with your skin than you think.I take the hair, skin, and nails Vitamins, Vitamin C, & Vitamin D.I also occasionally do dermaplaning, research it and your skin type before you try though.

The first few days of using this serum I didn't have a problem but after the 3rd day or so my face started drying out and I started to get bumps on my face. I did use moisturizer but my face was still drying out. When i stopped using the serum it took me a couple days to recover from it but eventually my skin went back to normal. It's been a couple of weeks now since I've used the serum and I don't know if I want to try it out again.

  Alright. When I turned 35 I knew it was time to get serious about my skin care. And by ""serious"", I mean start an actual routine that is not just soap and water. In addition to a real cleanser (buh-bye Dove!), toner and moisturizer, I've been using this on my face every night before bed. It's been two weeks and I've already received two genuine compliments about my skin looking great! That may not mean a lot to you, but one of them was from my MOM who is the most critical and judgmental person I know on EARTH. And she hates giving compliments. Absolutely hates it. And yet my skin has made such an improvement that she just couldn't help herself. Amazing! I have noticed that my skin is softer and doesn't look as dull, so that's pretty cool for just two weeks.

  I have been using this serum for a little bit now and it's just amazing! I was a little skeptical at first as I have sensitive skin that normally breaks out with any change (environmental, skin care routine, etc). So, I did start slowly using it once a day. And I was eventually able to get up to twice a day, which to me was the real game-changer.Since then I have purchased this for gifts for almost everyone I know. It does contain a lot of botanicals and I have only heard from one friend who couldn't use it due to her severe allergies - so if you have allergies read the ingredients before you purchase.Other than that, it's been great for me and for my friends! :-)

  The serum is light and doesn't feel sticky. I put it on after my toner and before my moisturizer. My skin looked brighter overall right away. I have some heavy melasma on my cheeks and jaw line that I am trying to see if it will help fade some. I have been using it about 3 weeks so I will probably go through one more 1oz bottle and see what it looks like at 6-8 weeks. It seems like one 1oz bottle should last about 4 or 5 weeks depending on how much you use. 5-6 drops is plenty for each use morning and night. Overall it is a good addition to my daily skincare routine so far.

  Short version: helped with some flaking but still want to add a moisturizer.Skin type: comboI need a little bit more moisture. But intend to  continue using this.Drys fast. Feels smooth on my face. Sticky on my fingers. Not tight feeling. No stinging. No redness. No rashes, burning, etc.I've been playing around with skin care. Learned, seriously you can't use body lotion on your face. I had stopped when I got this. And only used this and makeup. Couple days later my face was looking better. It wasn't tight or dry... Just didn't feel moisturized. So, i applied some lotion I had to my face. Next day. üò£ Dry and flaky again. Stopped with that, and order some face moisturizer. In the couple of days it took to deliver my face did heal again.Why I think this helped rather than just not using the wrong lotion. 2 reasons.I had this 1in by 1/2in strip on my hand (back side above the knuckles) that had become mildly burned or whatever from an airbag. It was super dry and flaky. I could feel it every time i touched my face (from nose tickles). Anyways... For a couple of days, I also applied some of this to that spot that wasn't healing. It helped it. Smooth again.The 2nd reason.I think my face doesn't look as irritated, raw and red.

  So I‚Äôm on my third bottle of this and I finally figured out how to use it! I bought my first bottle over a year ago and at first I was just using it sporadically, by itself at night. I took a break from it because I like more of a moisturizing feeling and I wasn‚Äôt seeing any changes to my skin. Folks...you have to fully commit to see a difference!!! I started applying morning and night, once I let it dry (a couple of minutes) I then apply Lush Full of Grace serum bar and that locks the moisturizer back in. After using consistently for about 6 months, I‚Äôm seeing fine lines on my forehead disappear. I‚Äôm seeing pores on my nose shrink so now no more blackheads. I‚Äôm seeing an overall brightness too!  When you apply it has a nice tight/light dryness feeling to it, but I would suggest adding another layer of moisturizer. Think of this serum as something that tightens. I‚Äôm 37, with combination skin (dry/oily). My problem areas are my forehead (sunburned way too much in my 10s &20s). Give it a try!!! I‚Äôm hooked now!

  I wanted to like this product. I really, really, really did. With a ton of positive reviews I just had to try it. Unfortunately, I went through two bottles of it and didn't see any change to my skin. I'm unimpressed. I'm glad it helped so many other people, but it's not for me.UPDATE: I have since upgraded my original rating from two stars to three based only off the excellent customer service I received after posting my review. So truly, it's 3 stars for the product itself, but FIVE HUGE STARS for the customer service.Shortly after posting I received an email from Erica, a TruSkin Naturals representative, offering a full refund AND a free bottle of a different product to try. Having worked in customer service based jobs for most of my career, I am truly impressed by those who go above and beyond for their customers because the truth is they don't have to do that. Not only did I have a wonderful (and unexpected) customer service experience, but I also really like the toner that was sent to me. It all worked out and I am very happy thanks to Erica!

  I'm 42 years old & the last couple years I suffer from Rosacea every now & then. It's across my checks. It's horrible & embarrassing looking & I couldn't figure out why I was getting it. I went to the Dr & he was much help. The creams he gave me burned my face. So, I started to do some research & wanting something more orangic(I have very sensitive skin). I came across derma rolling & while searching derma rolling, I came across TruSkin. I ordered the derma roller with TruSkin Vit C Serum & TruSkin Vit C Moisturizer & let me tell you... IT HAS BEEN A GAME CHANGER. People noticed right away how smooth, clear & glowly my skin was. I don't use it daily. I'm bad about it, but when my skin acts up, I use derma roller & use TruSkin & my rosacea disappears in about 24-48 hours. Sometimes I would suffer for weeks. So a BIG THANK YOU to TruSkin!

  I bought ""TruSkin Vitamin C Serum"" about a month ago to give a try to a new product, since its a best selling product on Amazon. First, It delivered in very unprofessional packing (In plastic bubble wrap). Second, I did not see any instructions and quantity to use TruSkin Vitamin on the face, and no ingredients description on the bottle as well. Third, there wasn't even a single booklet with it. Fourth, no measurement on the sign on the dropper that how much you are using. Lastly, it gave me itchiness on the skin after using just for one week, as well as the little redness. So, I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY ""TruSkin Vitamin C Serum."" I TRIED TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE AS THEY PROMISE MONEY BACK AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, BUT NO REPLY. ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE.

I use a lot of stuff including from the dermatologist so hard to say what contributes to it - but tons of water and sunscreen are my best friends.Cons--just check the expiration date. my first bottle arrived Aug 2019, the expriration date was Dec 2019 with a 12 month logo on bottle if you look for it. I have still not finished this bottle and use it everyday. Is it bad for my skin? Is it not working on my skin? I don't know. But my 2nd bottle that just arrived has an expiration of De 2020, so I should be fine.I could have switched brands when this bottle was up, i've seen others mentioned by some beauty influencers, but I decided to stick with this one.

  I purchased this serum at the recommendation of my dermatologist. I was looking for a skin care plan that would address my aging skin, fine lines and sun spots/uneven tone. My skin was not bad, but I was using a bunch of products w no real strategy, and spending a lot of money. Dermatologist told me to throw everything away and use a good vitamin c serum every day with a spf 30 sunscreen. Retinol at night followed by a good, basic moisturizer. She said to look for a highly rated Vitamin C serum. That‚Äôs how I found TruSkin and I am so glad I did.Three months later and my skin tone is definitely more vibrant and healthy looking. Sun patches are fading noticeably. Pores appear smaller. Last month I started following the Vitamin C serum with the TruSkin Hyaluronic serum. Skin feels more .... springy. That‚Äôs the only way I can describe it.I saw a YouTube video reviewing this product, commenting on the texture/feel as the product dries on your skin. My answer to this is: it‚Äôs no big deal! Feels a little tight, but, as recommended, follow with a basic moisturizer and it‚Äôs not even an issue. Makeup goes on just fine! (Lately I don‚Äôt wear much foundation at all...just concealer.

I used this serum pretty much every morning for two and a half months. I expected to see a bit of a difference in discoloration and wrinkles, especially because my sun exposure has only declined this winter, but I really can't see an effect. Of course, I don't have replicates and didn't leave an untreated patch of skin as a control. Mostly feel it's important to record this because I think many of these reviews are inflated.

  I'm going to start off by saying I never write reviews about anything, which is pretty backwards because I'm the first one to read reviews about every product I use, but I just had to write something about this product (it's God sent!). I've tried EVERYTHING from top of the line to drugstore brands, and I kid you not this product works!!!! I am a 42 year old African American female who has always struggled with hyperpigmentation. I had dark slots ALL OVER my face! It was so bad I didn't want my boyfriend to seed my true skin when I woke up in the morning (that's how bad it was). I could sneeze wrong and scratch my face and it would leave a mark forever, so I was desperate to find something that actually works for me without breaking my skin out due to me sensitive skin on top of hyperpigmentation. I read several reviews about this product and saw I few pictures and I was sold, but I still wasn't sure if this product would work for me so I said ""What do I have to lose it's only $19.99, and I practically bought everything else out there on the market so why not give it a try?"" Within a couple of days I started to notice a difference in the texture of my skin and after a couple of weeks I started to notice my dark spots fading on my face. OMG! Is this really working? I said to myself, and fast forward 2 months later I have only one dark spot on my face and that is a tiny one on my  forehead due to scratching a pimple recently. Now this product is a must-have and Truskin Vitamin C Serum is truly a blessing. Thank you so much to the genius who created this product for people out there struggling with my same issues.

  I am currently halfway through my 2nd bottle. I use this consistently day and night before my moisturizer. The only time I do not use it is when I am exposed to the elements in the outdoors during the day. This is not a quick solution because it takes time to really clear and even out your face, but I did see quite a difference within two weeks. My skin is so much softer(thanks to the Hyaluronic acid), smoother, has cleared up dramatically, I look like I could have foundation on when I really don't. As someone who loves makeup, it's nice that I can just dab concealer under my eye and fix my eyebrows/lashes, and walk out the door. I don't wear foundation when I travel to extremely hot and humid places. This vitamin C serum has made my skin look amazing. The price is totally worth it, not the cheapest, but not the most expensive either. I am a customer for life!

My goodness, this has been the best $19.99 I‚Äôve ever spent. I have spent hundreds of dollars on toners,moisturizers , cleansers etc that claimed to be able to clear my hyperpigmentation, this was the ONLY thing that did it for me. You gave me my life back.

  Works well. I usually use a bit of acne cream on specific areas of my face because of tiny breakouts. While using the Vitamin C serum, I kept forgetting to put the acne cream on, but the trouble spots went away! The old acne scars are also fading very gradually, but still fading. Customer service is also great. I was contacted by Erica from TruSkin asking how I liked the product - I mentioned there are small white granules in it. They haven't bothered me, and I use it anyway, but thought it was weird. Erica told me its undissolved Vitamin C, and that its perfectly alright, but also offered to send me a replacement product. So product works well and customer service is great. I'm very happy with the product and plan to buy other things from them!

  Amazing product that really helped me in the last 10-15 days itself. I wouldn't claim overnight results or anything, but over time and usage as recommended twice a week, I can really see the changes.I love how it makes my skin look and feel. Helped me with adult acne as well, that was my biggest bane of existence! I never had acne as a teenager and to battle it at this age wasn't something I was expecting. Tried a lot of Over the Counter products and then some prescription meds. But what really helped me stop them from appearing was this serum.I diligently read all the reviews and was so very skeptical of the purchase. But I am glad that I bit the bullet and bought it. The great thing about this is the product isn't very pricey but still works wonders.I have already recommended this to all the ladies in the family. Go for it!

  I purchased this serum to use after dermarolling my stretch marks from pregnancy. I did a 48 hour test on my belly before starting the dermarolling, and the hyperpigmentation I have on my belly button and my linea nigra faded by about 50%. I've been applying bio oil, vitamin E, and exfoliating for 6 weeks with no success, and wasn't even expecting this to work on the pigment.I will add to this review once I see (or don't see) any changes regarding the stretchmarks, but amazed to see these unexpected results so soon!

  I love it.I actually use the Tru skin Vit C serum 2 nights a week and the retinol moisturiser, one night a week. I have been using the products for about 4 months now and my skin has been truly rejuvenated. The Vit C product in particular has reduced the dark blemishes on my skin and made my skin more toned. My complexion is the same but brighter - more like glowing. My face still looks alive even when I am tired.  My eye area is generally brighter as I used to have dark circles when I am sleep deprived and these would take ages to reverse. Now they are barely visible.

  This product has a million positive reviews but let me just add to the chorus of praise.  No one paid for my product or is paying me to write this review.  I'm a busy lawyer and mom of two young kids and was looking to up my skin care regime.  I had used Vitamin C in the past but found that it was too concentrated and left my face blotchy and red in spots, so I discontinued it.I have been using this product for about a month.  I am a woman of color with medium brown skin.  When I break out, I am left with scars and hyperpigmentation.  This serum slowly but surely is helping those scars fade.  They are not gone but I certainly see an improvement.Perhaps even more importantly, this product has completely cured my breakouts!  I never broke out until the pandemic hit (stress eating, perhaps).  Every time I ate dairy, I would usually have a few pimples a few days later.  After using this serum, that never happens anymore.  My skin is clear and glowing.At this price point, it's not a huge investment and it really works so I certainly recommend giving it a try.

  I'm always skeptical of any skin care product and claims it may make, but I have seen results from this. I've been using it twice a day for about three weeks and my skin does look better. I had some very red acne scars on my cheek and chin that look much better. They are still there, but they are much lighter. Some of my lighter, less severe scars are barely noticeable at all any more. It hasn't caused me to break out any more than usual (maybe even a little less, but it's hard to say), which is always a concern for me as I have oily, acne-prone skin.

  It could be my own fault but I feel a little mislead. When I searched for these 3 ingredients individually Amazon presented how these 3 things are frequently purchased together for a bulk price. So it made sense to order because it is what I was looking for. Except, I was so excited to try them and went I read the bottles more closely I realized that they all have the same ingredients so I really didn't need to purchase all 3. For example, The Hyaluronic acid already has vitamin C so I didn't need to purchase the Vitamin C which already contains Hyaluronic acid... Like I said it could be my own fault. Have to pay close attention and read the fine print.

    Inconsistent quality, broken glass

  I bought this product based off of a fab review that I read on Buzzfeed. The first two bottles were great; consistency was light and it didn't make my face sticky or gummed up. I noted a pleasant citrus smell upon first opening those two bottles...The third month/bottle arrived with no scent and was very thick and cloudy.The fourth bottle was the same as the third, but I decided to keep with it as the first two bottles had A NOTICABLE improvement on my sensitive skin. However... I get near the bottom of the fourth bottle, and I suddenly see the dropper is somehow broken. There are pieces of glass in my serum. I don't move my facial care stuff, everything literally lives in my medicine cabinet. There was NO TRAUMA to the bottle to cause the glass to break. I figured I'd be okay cause clearly a tiny dropper with no contact would break into a large piece, right? Wrong. Lots of teeny tiny pieces of glass. The product was clearly already defective. The worst part is that with the inconsistent texture and color, I couldn't see tiny pieces of glass. It all looks like cloudy bubbles. Put a bit on my fingers, patted them together to check for foreign material. Proceeded slowly, and I'm glad I did. I would have had glass in my skin.I noted that the Best Used By Date is 12/2021 on all four bottles.I wanted to love this product. I have fair skin, large pores, have lost weight so my skin isn't as tight as most ppls, skin allergies, and psoriasis. So... Believe me when I say that I wanted to love this product. Two months were great. I can't justify a 50/50 purchase at this time, and honestly I'm a bit salty to find the glass broken.This item has a decent price. So does The Ordinary. So does Sephora brand. Paula's Choice is a recent find and EXCELLENT. Quality control questions like ""what color or texture is this supposed to be?"" are a non issue.

  I really wanted this to work.  I have hyperpigmentation and thought I had finally found the solution  after reading all of the wonderful reviews. However, I still have not stopped using it and use it as recommended. Two times a day, day and night. I have yet to finish the bottle. A little goes a long way and you're only supposed to apply a thin layer (your face still needs to breathe). I can safely say that my face has not broken out while using this other that the normal hormonal break outs as per some of the reviews I have read of this causing breakouts and I do have somewhat sensitive/acne prone skin. It will dry out your face a little. Vitamin C does that as it moves dead skin to help new skin surface so a good moisturizer is recommended.

  I've been loving the Vitamin C serum! My skin has been so dull, dry, and pale for the last few years after I had my son. I also started noticing more lines and discoloration from the sun and hormone imbalances that no matter what I did never went away. It was always sensitive on top of all that, so every time I tried anything new I would breakout like crazy. This Vitamin C serum was recommended to me a few months ago and I was blown away how well my skin responded to it! My skin is brighter (without any makeup!), it's healthier and more balanced - so no more dry patches! My discoloration is fading and my skin is firmer, meaning those little lines aren't nearly as noticeable. I also didn't go through one of those ""breakout phases"" like I have with every other product I put on my face. I use it once a day at night if anybody was interested in knowing. I have no plans on stopping this product! And also customer service is amazing; so helpful and quick if you have any issues or concerns!

  Edited: I had not opted for a refund since I did use the product even though it did not have visible effects on me. But I was approached by the customer service the day after i posted my review mentioning that they have started processing my refund as I was not happy with their product (and they stick by their 100% customer satisfaction moto). They even offered me with a complementary bottle that will better suite my skin type. The customer service even followed up to check if the refund was successful and if I was still interested in a complementary product. I still give 4 stars since the original product didnt work for me. But you can always try, if the product doesnt work for you you can always return it and opt for another brand.Original: Did not see any difference in my skin. it did not make my skin brighter, fresher looking skin, improved tone and clarity, smaller pores, less breakouts, fine lines and dark spots like it mentions. I wanted to give it a fair shot and use it over a period of time to look for better results and not be biased. its been over 1&1/2 months. I don't see any difference at all. The only good thing is that the product does not have a horrible smell like some skin care products and it does not cause any reaction.  But it genuinely did not lessen my breakouts or even help my pores. It is not necessary

  I had such high hopes after reading all the good reviews that this would work for me. So I bit the bullet and paid what I thought was way too much in hopes it would help. However, after using it for 2 weeks straight, I can tell zero difference in my skin. It doesn‚Äôt even feel softer, which is strange I think. I know it‚Äôs a chance anytime you buy stuff like this, and I guess this time it didn‚Äôt pay off for me.

  Not sure if product does what it is supposed to, but I do know it does something! I had a skin irritation from a cheap ring on my finger that would not go away for months. Once I started using this product, obviously by applying it to my face with my hands, it went away in a week! 1 dropperful covers my entire face and chest/neck. 1 bottle lasts a little over a month when covering those areas. It doesn't have a scent. I apply after washing and before moisturizing. I have eczema and rosacea spots and it has helped with the eczema but not so much for the rosacea.  Hope this info helps.

  I love this serum!  First of all, my husband is very sensitive to fragrance and this product has no smell at all, so I can use it at night before bed and he doesn't even notice.  It also absorbs very quickly and dries so you can apply moisturizer almost immediately afterward.  I also use it in the morning, add moisturizer and make up and my skin look like it's airbrushed!  My dark spots are hardly noticeable and my wrinkles are blurred.  I get complements on my ""Age 55"" skin all the time!After using it for about 2 months, I decided to switch to the next (more expensive) level up of the Truskin SuperC Plus Serum thinking ""if I love this serum so much, than more must be better"", but ended up going back to the basic TruSkin Vitamin C Serum.  It seemed to work much better and it's less expensive.And... to comment on the TruSkin team and Customer Service... they nail it every time!  With every order they reach out to see if you received your product and ask for feedback.  On my last order, Amazon delivered a package but instead of my favorite serum, they delivered plastic tumblers. ???  I was so disappointed and when I responded to Erica's follow up email about my order letting her know Amazon sent the wrong item, she immediately offered a resolution - even though they had nothing to do with Amazon's mistake - and did not just offer a small fix, but gave me a new order of serum at no charge!!  What?!?  No one does that anymore and I'm truly wowed by the recovery.  Thank you Erica and TruSkin!  You made me a loyal customer!

  Each time I order this product it's because I like the results - softer skin texture, not oily, balancing etc. I can't seem to find a  moisturizer that doesn't breaks me out more, is too oily, or too dry. With this product underneath, they all perform better, balancing my dry cheeks, oily T zone.But I have to say each time I've ordered it, part of the product has been lost in packaging. The product itself is not equipped with a sealed lid like others, where the dropper comes separately, thus allowing the product to leak when bounced around. Second, it's an Amazon wearhouse issue and how they also secure it with other orders.

  This is a review to the review below. The seller promptly got in contact with me and extensively explained why the product is cloudy and everything checks out for me. Basically, they use a stable version of vitamin C - Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (SAP) - which is best suited for the state of the product. In light of that, the prompt and considerate customer service, and the fact that serum definitely did not harm, I think it is a solid 4 stars. I believe my skin just did not need it but you should definitely buy it. You have nothing to lose._____________________________________So, I got it cloudy. The first I ever got Vitamin C (from a provider whose name I currently can't remember) it was clear and had a slightly zesty smell to it. This on is cloudy and has an off-putting scent. The manufacturers note that the cloudy nature of the serum is normal and is to be expected. Furthermore, they claim it doesn't affect the potency of their formula. I have read extensively online and the opposite seems to be the case. Oxidation, the cause of the cloudiness, DOES reduce the potency of vitamin c. In any event, I have been using it for about 2 weeks now with absolutely no improvements. Acne remained, hyperpigmentation remained, fine lines remained. The only ""up-side"" to this is that I didn't breakout at the very least. I am currently looking into purchasing vitamin C from another provider since it seems this one can't keep their well-preserved (or smelling decent).And just as a fair note to the providers, even IF your claim that oxidation does not affect the potency of your product is true (which I now highly doubt) you should STILL invest in means to preserve the physical quality of unperturbed vitamin C, if anything, for the peace of mind of consumers, but most importantly, so it works.

  My dermatologist recommended a 20% Vitamin C serum to reduce bruising from thin, fragile skin.  I found that TruSkin was less expensive and more reliable than several others I tried.  I do think it‚Äôs reduced bruising on my forearms, but an entirely unlooked for benefit was that my face stopped breaking out in small, itchy sore red bumps several days a month for the first time since 2009.  I am in my late sixties, which means the breakouts are unlikely to have been related to hormonal changes, and was diagnosed with adult acne in 2009‚Äîalthough it never looked like acne to me, just little red bumps, usually around my nose, lips and chin.  I was treating it successfully enough every month with an antibiotic lotion my dermatologist prescribed, but noticed several months into my nightly use of the Truskin Naturals Vitamin C serum for Face that I hadn‚Äôt had to use the the antibiotic lotion in some time. In the two years I‚Äôve been using the serum, I‚Äôve needed the antibiotic lotion about three times, a very noticeable reduction.  I also think the serum has been helpful for skin texture, evenness and minimizing wrinkles‚ÄîI have recently been having the happy experience of new co-workers expressing apparently genuine shock on learning my age, saying they thought I was in my 50s.

  I'm pretty impressed so far with this great new discovery and will be adding it to my skin regime. Not only has the customer service and followup been great from this company, but the skincare tips and helpful advice have been a nice added benefit too. I've only used the Vitamin C serum for a short time but love the way it soaks into my skin and the wonderful way it makes my face feel. It's very light, not greasy or oily, and is a nice base under my moisturizer and foundation. It only takes a small amount to see the benefit. I've also tried blending a drop or two with my foundation as I'm applying it and have seen amazing results using it in that way too. All in all, this is a great product at a very reasonable cost that you should consider adding to your skin care routine. It's good for the man in your life too--as it doesn't have a feminine scent and absorbs into the skin nicely after a shave!

I tried not to get too excited though because I figured it could just be placebo. After using the product for only 3 days, I noticed an immense difference in both face and body. I mixed the serum into my facial moisturizer and my body lotion so I use it all over. I also wear sunscreen on both face/body because vit c makes the skin photosensitive. When talking on FaceTime with my cousin he told me I was glowing. My skin feels (and looks) smoother, softer, and brighter. I had folliculitis on my legs from shaving and it‚Äôs completely gone, too.  I am almost in disbelief. Put 3-4 drops on your face morning/night, and mix a few teaspoons into your body lotion and use after your shower.If you are on the fence, I seriously recommend buying this serum or any other pure vit c serum.

  I read the reviews before purchasing thinking that this would be a great product. Sadly, I was wrong. I have tried other serums before and this, unfortunately, is the worst one. I haven‚Äôt noticed any difference in my face or complexion after weeks of use.  It is very sticky so if you DO plan on buying, I would suggest applying it to a damp face. Also, it is mainly bubbles in the dropper every time I try to get anything out of the bottle so I have to keep dipping the medicine dropper at least 3 times to get a normal amount of ‚Äúserum bubbles‚Äù to cover my face.  I would not recommend purchasing this and I only gave it 1 star because it smells somewhat decent. But really, I could‚Äôve rubbed an orange on my face and gotten the same results.

  Not very wow‚Äôed by this. Used it consistently 2x a week morning and night and don‚Äôt see any difference in my skin. When i did use it .. it would leave like flakes over my face and dry it out A little where i needed to moisturize right away but had to wait a little while for it to Absorb otherwise the flakes were bad. There really was no scent so that was good , and it didnt Really bother my skin which is sometimes sensitive which was also good.UPDATE ON MY REVIEW: after reviewing the product and how it hadnt Worked for me .. Erica a customer service representative from TruSkins reached out and offered a full refund for the product AS WELL as an additional item free of cost that she believed would work for my skin instead of the initial one. The customer service provided was absolutely amazing and I‚Äôm shocked with how attentive and caring Erica was with getting me a more useful product as well as giving instruction on it ! Totally recommend future purchases from here as well as maybe reaching out beforehand to ask about the products and what would Work best for you and how to use the product correctly!

  I used TruSkin serum for about 6 months. I wanted to love the serum, but unfortunately I did not. It goes on smooth and works well fighting lines and wrinkles. My skin felt soft and overall looked good, but it never looked better than when I started, just the same. After a few months I noticed age spots were appearing and getting quite dark. After 6 months the dark spots were the worst I‚Äôve ever had, so I discontinued use and returned to my old serum that has slowly helped the age spots fade. I like the serum, but it doesn‚Äôt do everything I expect a serum to (I.e. lighten and Eliminate age spots) so I will not purchase again and do not recommend.

  I have now been using this product for over a week. Still no change to my skin and I have had more breakouts than usual still unsure if it is related so I am going to continue to use it for now so I can get a better feel. The reason I am giving it 3 stars so early on is not due to lack of results as I know it is too soon to tell. But due to the sticky, film like feeling it has on my skin. I have used other Vitamin C serums and never experienced that. I am going to try to look past it to see what results I get and how my breakouts progress. I will update with my results in the future.Also other vitamin c serums have been clear and this on is cloudy not sure if this is normal? Or if I got a bad batch and thats why I'm experiencing problems with itUpdate Bottle 1 Done:Mom: So I am at the end of the bottle and my mom finished hers. She is in her 50s and even my father noticed and asked if she had been doing something different. So she is definitely pleased. Says she noticed a glow about her skin.Me:As for me I have definitely noticed that my face looks brighter and I've gotten used to the weird consistency I'm starting to kinda like it now. I have been using it twice a day morning and evening, and I use moisturizer over it which helps with any stickiness. As far as my acne Ive had less pimples but my blackheads have not diminished (not that its targeting that just extra information). Regardless I would not reorder as I have found others gave me better results

  I actually decided purchasing this product without much thought into it as I had received an amazon gift card and didn‚Äôt have anything particular to use it on so I just ordered two random items as one of them being the TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C Face serum and it has actually been the BEST thing for my skin. I didn‚Äôt have many blemishes or much acne due to back in October when I started using Curology for my skin as just a thin cream for my face at night just because I like my skin to be always looking top notch. I then coordinated this serum into my skin routine just after washing my face in the shower with Aveeno regular face wash to clean my skin and then using this after the shower when my face dries, keeping it on my skin and neck for about 2-3 minutes and then washing it off and it has honestly been OUTSTANDING. I attend college in Florida so after a long day at the beach this definitely refreshes my skin to the max and I can even feel it doing the work while drying on my face killing all bacteria in the most soothing way leaving my skin with the best and brightest complexion (especially while having a nice Florida tan). I even got my girlfriend, friends and family to order this product because of how amazing it makes your skin feel and is always backed up by the BEST results.Thank you so much TruSkin Naturals for your Vitamin C Face Serum and I will definitely be a lifetime customer.

  This is the second time I have ordered the Vitamin C serum.  I really like it.  I think it has helped with the appearance of my skin.  I am 38 and have sun spots.  I think it has helped lessen the darkness of the spots.  I think it also makes my skin look more plump and hydrated.  I have had zero reaction (breakouts) to the product.  The serum also does not have a scent which is nice, I am sensitive to smells.  I will continue to order and tell others about it.  I use it under my moisturizer.

  I have used this for a little over 3 weeks now and there is a noticeable improvement.  I had an eye infection which left one of my eyes a little droopy and the skin around my eye a little funky.  This tightened everything up and smoothed all my skin out.  I noticed the other day when moisturizing that my skin looked really good, more youthful, tighter, and smoother.  This is the only thing I have been using that is different from my normal skin routine.  It also has lightened some sun spots under my eye.  Highly recommend, especially at this price.  There is no noticeable scent.  It does not moisturize mature skin, but does allow for the face cream you use to be more readily absorbed.  I will purchase again.  (I'm also using it on my hands and it works!)

  I was very hesitate in purchasing this item due to the good and not so good reviews.  I was so unsure of this product whereas I researched outside of Amazon's reviews.  So based on the professional views of this item outlined the ingredients which all I liked.  So upon receipt of this item I first tested a small amount on my hands for about 6 hours.  Later that evening, I applied a small amount all over my face and immediately follow by face cream (once it dried).  I first felt so light tingling in my face in certain areas.  Upon arising the next morning, I immediately looked in the mirror and I was very pleased of the results.  I am glad that I purchased this particular Vitamin C serum, because I previously was using Tree of Life Vitamin C serum and was satisfied, however, I noticed that Truskin Vitamin  C serum is more potent and the results are extraordinary.

  I wish I had taken some before/after photos but I did not. I kind of have sensitive skin most of the time and did not have any negative reactions.  I noticed a big difference in the darkness below my eyes almost immediately. It's pretty much gone. My skin feels softer/smoother overall. It is taking some time to see any results on the spots of sun damage. There is no odor/smell that I have noticed. The serum has a cloudy appearance. It has a vague sting when applied that doesn't last long at all. I did notice that when I wiped my fingertips after application on a dark hand towel, the towel then had become discolored. I also use the serum after using a derma roller in the evenings. My skin almost feels like a sun burn with tightness after use but after a moisturizer is applied that tends to go away also. So basically, good product for sensitive skin, no scent, not very moisturizing but helped with skin texture and appearance. I will buy again!

  I had been Skinceuticals customer in the past, but wanted something a little more budget friendly and found the reviews on TruSkin products and thought I'd give them a try (especially since I could buy the entire product line for the cost of a single Skinceuticals product!) I purchased the Vitamin C serum, the HA serum, eye cream, face wash and the Vitamin C moisturizer and began using them on 8/8. I was hoping to reduce the constant redness and get rid of the little bumps and fine lines popping up on this 40 year old face. These pics are dated 8/12 and 8/18. I have no products on in either picture. The redness has gone down a lot and SOMEHOW I didn't even notice that I had bags under my eyes, but that has gone down quite a bit as well. The texture of my skin is much nicer. I'm very skeptical of reviews that claim to have dramatic overnight effects. I don't look radically different after a week, but I can definitely see progress!  If this is a weeks' worth of progress I think I will be pretty happy in a month or two. I was very pleasantly surprised how well the serums absorb. I wear powder mineral makeup and I feel moisturized, but not the ""wet"" feeling some other products leave behind so the powder goes on smoothly!I will note that after a couple of days I was feeling a bit dry and substituted a heavier moisturizer at night with the rest of the products and it offset it. It may have just been too much Vitamin C to start off with.Will update in a month!

  I'm 22 years old and not very concerned about wrinkles at the moment, thankfully. (knock on wood)I purchased this product for the many health benefits it offers, as well as the hopes for minimizing some redness that I have in my T-Zone area. Honestly, at first I didn't notice too much of a difference but then after about two-three weeks of using this product, I've been receiving a lot of compliments on my skin and how healthy it looks! One of my friends said my skin even looks somewhat porcelain. At a closer look, I have noticed that the redness in my T-Zone area looks more evened out and less angry, and I usually have dark purple circles under my eyes but the purple seems to have faded almost completely. Which was an extremely nice surprise for me! :DI think my skin was desperately thirsting for these healthy vitamins. I now use this serum in my daily skin care routine along with St. Ives Timeless Skin Facial Moisturizer, Collagen Elastin, to moisturize after applying the serum and it works wonderfully! I'm so please and very curious about more of TruSkins products now.

  Let me start by saying I was not compensated in anyway for this product. I purchased it based on the reviews. I didn‚Äôt expect the product to work as well or as fast as it did. I didn‚Äôt take any pictures and wished I did. I bought the product a month ago. I used it when I remembered for about two weeks. Then I got serious and used it every morning and night for the last two weeks. My hyperpigmentation on my cheeks has dramatically decreased and I haven‚Äôt had any  new breakouts (even during my cycle). I only added this product and Acure brightening scrub to my routine (and increased my water intake). This serum has changed my life. My face is clearing up beautifully and my skin tone is improving but consistently And patience is key. I can‚Äôt comment on anti aging properties because I don‚Äôt have any fine lines or wrinkles. I used only two drops on each cheek and one drop on my forehead. The only con I have is the ingredients are a bit sketchy. The first ingredient is organic herbal infusion. What the heck is that? Because the ingredients are shady I‚Äôm a bit hesitant to repurchase. I will use the rest of the bottle because it does work and I haven‚Äôt experienced any sensitivity or skin issues.

  I use this along with a B-Complex and EMU oil on my skin.  I cannot even say I use it daily since I am a bit lazy about my skincare.  As a teen, I never had acne issues, so I never got into good habits.  Now in my 40s, I am a bit bummed about that.  My skin was looking dull and a bit saggy, so I thought I'd work toward better habits.  My sister had given me some Platinum Skin B-Complex and EMU oil that was working well, and I was pleased, but when I added in this vitamin C serum, I swear it kicked everything into high gear.  My face is brighter and tighter.  Love it! Definitely seeing a difference.

  On my 2nd bottle and still no noticeable results. I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot by buying the 2nd bottle and using it longer. Both bottles came in an amber color glass bottle with a dropper. Both bottles have crystal type fragments in the serum. No sure if it‚Äôs supposed to or not but both came that way. Kind of annoying when your putting it on and then use moisturizer, you can feel the crystals. Little to no smell noticed, not greasy. I bought it since the reviews were good and I wanted something to even out or fade my sun spots, which are not real dark. For the small size and higher price, I expected some results. I will try another brand next time. Very disappointed.

  I've only been using this a few weeks and so far I haven't had any additional outbreaks. I was reluctant to try because I was in the middle of a serious breakout and didn't want to cause my face anymore stress. But I decided what the hell it couldn't get any worse so I tried it once in the morning upon waking up and once fore going to bed. I would wash my face with Clinique face wash for oily skin, apply Clinique toner for oily skin, then apply this serum and last my Clinique moisturizer for oily skin..... Well it DID NOT make my skin flare up and it actually calmed my pimples. I have acne prone skin and it's very sensitive. Again it's only been a few weeks and not quite a month and I feel like it has really helped my skin. My pimples don't hurt like they usually do. Im almost done with my first bottle and wanted to try another bottle to see full results. I really feel like this has helped my face alot. I went from big hard bumps to small painless bumps and I'm hoping this next bottle will completely make them go away.Update: I am halfway thru my 2nd bottle and my skin has def approved! No more hard cystic like bumps. I wash, clarify, and moisturize with my regular products then I put their vitamin C serum all over my face. Then once it dries, I put a small drop on my breakouts but I don't rub it in ... I just let it dry. When I get up in the morning, the big bumps go down and the little boys disappear. I will keep using this because it really calms my skin from itching and burning and helps with my breakouts! And helps with my hyperpigmentation. Now I need to find something to help with the acne scars and dark spots.

This company (through its customer service representative, Erica) really showed great initiative, integrity, and above and beyond service. Just 3 days after I posted the review above, Erica emailed me and honored the company's customer satisfaction guarantee (which I knew about when I purchased the products, but had forgotten). Erica promptly and fully refunded both bottles I had purchased (without me needing to return the empty bottles---which I had thrown away by then anyway). Additionally, she asked me what my skin care concerns are so that she could recommend a different product. After I shared with her my skin care concerns, she recommended the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and offered to send me a full-sized bottle for free for me to try. I received my complimentary bottle in the next week or so. We'll see if I see more of a difference with this serum. In the meantime, I will say that although the original product I had purchased didn't do anything for me, I am extremely pleased with the wonderful and attentive service this company offers and the dedication they have towards making sure their customers are satisfied. So while the original product garnered only 2 stars, the company itself deserves 5 stars.

  I absolutely love this product.Here is what I was looking for:Since I turned 15, I've been getting acne on my chin and cheeks. My skin is super dry and I wanted something that would brighten my face, help lighten the marks, and moisturize my skin - without spending $1000 for Drunk Elephant or some other brands. I've tried a lot of different products and combinations and nothing worked until I decided to give this a chance. I saw results within the first week. I am two bottles in and 60 days later and I have almost no acne marks in my chin, some in my cheeks, and after getting my facial last time, my esthetician said that my face has a lot more moisture than usual. Nothing has changed in my skincare routine but the addition of this product. I am super happy with this overall.Then, the customer service representative, Erica goes above and beyond. I wanted to add a different product to decrease the acne and she walked me through the products herself and made some great recommendations.I absolutely love this company and I am so happy I found them!I wish I had taken some before and afters for you all, but unfortunately, I didn't. Instead, here is a picture with minimal makeup on. The acne scars are barely noticeable and my face looks brighter than ever, This was after three weeks of using the Vitamin C Serum.

  Initially I really liked this product. Felt my skin looked refreshed and bright and had no side effects. Within a few weeks, I developed a recurrent peeling/burning rash around my lips that lasted two months. Didn't know what was causing it because it would come and go in cycles every 5 days. Eventually, by process of elimination, I found out it was this product I had an allergic reaction to even though i made sure not to let it get close to my lips. Finally, after 7 days of discontinuing, it resolved and hasn't returned. Had to throw it out, too bad. Definitely skin-test it first. Has potential if you don't have too-sensitive skin.

  The color of the product was a little off putting. As others have stated it looks like spit, but I did notice after a day the bubbles did go away. I think during shipping it just got shook around & the temperature changes made it bubbly & cloudy. I really wanted to like this product, but it honestly didn‚Äôt do anything, it dried my skin out actually. And after it dried, it would peel I guess you could say? Like it didn‚Äôt absorb into my skin at all, it just dried like a mask and would start peeling. I used this faithfully for just about 2 weeks, tonite I‚Äôm just not even bothering with it tho. I‚Äôll just use my other skin care items I‚Äôve been using minus this serum.The positive is that it does have a great smell, it smells like orange/citrus.

  I gave myself about 3 weeks before leaving a reviews after using this and I for sure had seen results way before that! Literally in just a few days after my first application of the Vitamin C serum my face had started to glow! My dark spots were noticeably lighter and my overall complexion was very even. I used to spend $70 on even better by Clinique but this tiny $20 Vitamin C has that beat! I make sure to have a washed/clean face and apply a thin layer all over my face and neck. I do this in the morning and at night. You might feel a slight tightness but that's normal. This stuff seriously works and If you have dark spots from the sun, acne I recommend you DO NOT HESITATE and just BUY this!

  It‚Äôs too early to tell as I‚Äôve only been using it about 3 weeks. I'm in my 60‚Äôs but I do feel like my skin looks better, with a bit of a glow. It also looks like my age spots are fading but maybe that‚Äôs just wishful thinking. Not sure yet. The product is very easy to apply, has no scent that I can discern, it‚Äôs not sticky and it seems to be clarifying and smoothing my skin. I‚Äôll probably purchase a second bottle soon and maybe review again in a few months. If you‚Äôre on the fence about purchasing I recommend that you try a bottle.

  This serum is not a moisturizer for people who have criticized it. It is amazing for your skin though. After a week I could see my skin looking more even and elastic. Google the ingredients and how they benefit your skin before purchasing. The hydraulic acid in the formula has even made my eyelashes grow and thicken. I always use this product after my toner. Then after using the serum I use a moisturizer. The product has also helped me with my under eyes. Also remember that a product like this is more likely to benefit you in the long run. Nobody paid me to write this but I love skin care so yeah this is a good product. Don't use it if you are using any chemical exfoliants cause it can be harsh on your skin. I'm not an expert, just a skin care guru. Thank you!! Loved it

  I bought this after reading all the reviews and hoped for a ‚Äúgood batch‚Äù.  Welp, that didn‚Äôt happen. I got a bottle full of a cloudy, thick looking serum. I tried to look past the initial appearance.  It came with a clear, safety seal around the top.  That typically indicates a product is new and untampered with.  But, just beneath the dropper lid, I could see what looked like dried up serum. So either it leaked out and hardened under the saftey deal (doubtful) or it was used and resold. I‚Äôm beyond disappointed.

  21 Y/O female nursing student.I was skeptical of buying, even though I read a million great reviews. I hope my review can give you some insight and help you out like I wanted to be helped when looking to purchase a week ago. So far, so great! I have been using in combo with Neutrogena Toner before hand and Neutrogena Hydroboost gel afterwards. I also bought a .25cm microneedle roller to use with this serum. I purchased TruSkin and microneedle a week ago and I was using the Neutrogena products before with little change. I have used the microneedle roller twice before bed since purchasing(every third day after the toner and before TruSkin serum) and I have used all other products morning and night for 7 days. I have normal skin with large pores around my nose and I am prone to breakouts and blackheads on my chin. After the first night using the serum and micro-needle I noticed a drastic change in my skin texture it was amazingly smooth. A week later and my breakouts are near obsolete. I can feel a tightening in my skin that wasn't there previously and I noticed a reduction in my acne spots that are fairly recent (I am a picker). My pores in my nose area are noticeably tighter and my blackheads are diminishing. My skin remains soft all throughout the day whereas before it was rough, a little bumpy, and semi-oily. Before purchasing these products, I did not wash my face day and night; Only night. This may be a factor. My skin tone seems more even and bright. I intend to continue using religiously and will update my review at the month mark! I recommend trying it. I cannot say that my wrinkles are less, as I don't have many, but if you are looking for a more even skin tone and a reduction in pore size/breakouts, give it a chance! I would recommend buying the micro-needle roller as well. Best of luck!

  I've been using this for two weeks. It's making a difference already in my skin. I can see that some spots are fading, which makes me very happy. I don't expect to have spots disappear completely, but I'll take all the fading I can get, as some are from old sun damage, and some are age related.I have two strikes going against me. I'm 60, so dry skin and age related skin issues. And I live in the high desert, so no humidity at all, plus 100 degrees in the summer and cold in the winter (in the mountains). This, under a moisturizer, is making this winter the first one bearable where my skin doesn't chap and itch.Can't wait to get to the bottom of the bottle and see how much better my skin looks!

  I developed melasma under my right eye during my first pregnancy.  I was hoping it would go away on its own but after the second pregnancy, it's still there and even worse. Time to do something about it. I wanted this product to work so bad on me. I loved the fact it's plant based, organic ingredients and of course the glowing reviews. The serum felt wonderful on my skin and I never broke out or had any irritation but my dark spot is still as visible as day 1 after using majority of the bottle. I'm not saying this product doesn't work, it just didn't work on me. I think I will try a dark spot corrector with hydroquinone next.

I also live in Texas (read sun damage). I do take care of my skin, but lately it has been less than perfect. Two weeks of using this serum, and my 17 year old tells me I look like I am in my 20's rather than 30's. Fine lines are going away. Acne scars fading. Pigmentation evening out. Even my neck and jawline are smoother. Now my husband wants some for his ""dad neck."" Will definitely reorder. Oh, and despite my sensitive skin, I use it on my actual eyelids without any irritation at all.

  I purchased this product to help fade my hyperpigmentation leftover from acne. I have extremely dry, sensitive skin. I use CeraVe hydrating cleanser every morning. Used this serum, tarte maracuja oil, and moisturizer with SPF. At night I would cleanse, use this serum, maracuja oil, and Origins night-a-mins cream. The origins night cream contains vitamin C and helped fade my acne marks a lot. I wanted more results so I purchased this vitamin C serum. I used it for over a month and experienced breakouts on my cheeks and forehead, leaving me with more red marks on my face. I stopped using it a few weeks ago and my skin is starting to completely clear up again. I know not to venture away from dermatologist recommended skincare ever again.

  Not every vitamin C serum is created equal. I have tried quite a few and this by far is THE BEST. I noticed a difference in my skin the first week. I also purchased the TruSkin retinol moisturizer and that was a disaster on my skin. I sent it back and was given a refund. But the TruSkin vitamin C serum works wonders!!! Everybody's skin is different, the retinol moisturizer from TruSkin got rave reviews from some people, unfortunately it did not work for me. But their vitamin C did, it hydrates, soften lines and brightens. It will be a staple for me going forward. I highly recommend.

  I've only used this product for a month, and think it is an excellent choice for underneath foundation first thing in the morning, especially in summer when makeup tends to be more shiny and not-sweat-proof. I take care of my skin, since I am an avid gardener I wear sunblock 1 million and a hat, but even so, never forget to moisturize every morning and night since my teens. Until last night. I never would have noticed the difference Vitamin C serum makes if I hadn't forgotten to moisturize. Should've gotten the message, from skin that feels like dry sheetrock, ""Hey, go moisturize!"" But no problems. I've used $100 jars of stuff that couldn't pass that test. For the price, I recommend trying it for yourself.

  This is my first review in all the years I've been on Amazon. I have several of the TruSkin products, vitamin c serum, cleanser, eye gel, and moisturizer.  I absolutely love all of them and use them daily. I bought the vitamin c serum first and loved it so much I reordered. Then I slowly began adding in other products and now this line is all I use.I am 49 and I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin. Wrinkles appear to be less noticeable and my skin feels and looks better overall. I am also a huge fan of the eye gel and have seen several reviewers complaining about the small size of the bottle. It is small but you don't need to use very much at all and a tiny bit goes a long way. All in all I love everything and will continue using these products everyday!On top of being completely satisfied with these products, I had a bottle of the vitamin c cleanser in my cart I was going to order but hadn't ""placed the order"". I got an email from TruSkin asking if I was satisfied with the products. My reply was ""so far I love everything I have been using!"" She replied thanking me for responding and asked if there was a complementary product I would like to receive. I told her I was just going to reorder the cleanser and she sent me a coupon code and I just placed the order and it didn't cost me a penny.I would have written this review anyway but I'm very happy with the products and the company. So I just wanted to share. I hope this helps anyone that may be on the fence about ordering.

  When I asked my dermatologist what her recommendations for skincare products were, a vitamin c serum was at the top of her list along with sunscreen, retinol, and a good moisturizer. This one had such good reviews, even though a few reviews threw me off with tales of breakouts and reactions, as I have sensitive skin.I am 100% sold on this stuff. After using it for 3 weeks, I started noticing a difference in the evenness and brightness of my skin but thought it might have been all in my head. Lo and behold, though, I have started getting compliments on my skin from family and friends during Zoom calls, which has never happened before. It's got to be this stuff.Ultimately, this is replacing my $$$ Lancome serum, which I do still love but can't keep forking out hundreds of dollars a year when I can get this beauty of a serum on Amazon for $20!

  PLEASE READ PRIOR TO PURCHASING!I was looking for a natural product, that would not only help the condition of my skin, but also make it feel more healthy as well. I have a very rare, very serious diseases for which I have to have chemotherapy regularly, and I take many, many medications . I'm a 31 year old, who REALLY hadn't started putting too much effort into skincare up until recently. I already have the Vitamin C moisturizer and love it, so I decided to try the serum, along with the eye gel Truskin offers (I think it's referred to as Super Eye Cream Gel, and it's amazing as well; my under eye area is so smooth and my dark circls have lightened so much, in only about a months time.... And the results began immediately!).Both products feel amazing on application and absorb quickly, and fully(no problems with makeup application after use!). Well, my skin did a ""purge,"" I believe, which is apparently quite common when you begin any new skin care regimen, and I do already get cystic acne right before and during my monthly cycle around my chin, but I thought I'd email the company and just ask if possibly I'd chosen the wrong product for my partular skin type. I gave a little description of what my skin was doing, along with a little background information about myself to give them a better idea so they could advise me better, and I asked if maybe the tea tree serum would be more appropriate since I had the acne.What I've received from Erica in return was so unexpected and so kind; the definition of above and beyond. Before anything else, her first instinct was to have me ensure with my doctor that these ingredients were ok for me to use with my treatment. It was something I hadn't even considered, and on top of that it no was a complete shock; a wonderful person, who was much more concerned about me as an individual, rather than making a sale! As I'm sure you all know, that's rare these days!  I checked with my doctor and my care team, and got back with her to let her know they didn't see anything wrong with me using the products... Infact they said they would highly recommend them because of how natural the products are! And though the company did NOTHING wrong, and I myself had mostly likely just chosen the wrong product for my individual skin type (or who knows; I'm still entertaining the idea of using both, alternating days maybe!), Erica then offered me a complementary bottle if the tea tree super serum (which was more expensive than this product...and again, they had no mistake to rectify!).  They had done nothing wrong; she was just that kind, and wanted me to be able to try it!  What a kind, honest and caring company! And thus far, ALL of the products are so amazing, and I hope to soon collect the entire line! I truly could not say enough good things about the products themselves, along with the unbelievably honest and caring customer service I have received. Definitely purchase this product!!Note; I've seen another brand on Amazon being advertised, sometimes alongside Truskin naturals' products, having very similar packaging and very similar names and claims. I didn't discuss this with Erica, but I have noticed it and i did mention it when discussing with my care team to make sure they were reviewing the correct products, and they were in agreement with me; that whatever those products are.... They are NOT the same as  TruSkin products and do not appear to be as safe, natural, or of high quality like these. So please make sure you don't add a knock off look alike to your cart (and this is not something I've been paid to do or even asked to do.... This is coming straight from my heart and the wonderful, touching experience I've had with this company!).

  I waited a month so I could give an accurate review because I was very skeptical. At first it caused some dryness and flaking, but no pain and since we‚Äôre wearing masks in public I just powered through. I didn‚Äôt really think it was doing much, but it‚Äôs now been a month and every time I look in the mirror I just can‚Äôt believe it. My melasma and hyperpigmentation are so much better. My skin just looks so bright! I‚Äôve also been using The Ordinary AHA BHA Peel which I think is working so well with the vitamin C. I am impressed.

  This product absolutely did not work for me. It made my skin extremely dry and accentuated all the fine lines in my face.

Beware this product does not work and makes your skin extremely dry. It accentuates all your fines lines and wrinkles.

  I‚Äôm so upset this product didn‚Äôt work out the way I was expecting. I was so excited when I read the reviews and saw how great the product worked for people, I guess my skin just doesn‚Äôt work well with this concentrated serum? I don‚Äôt have an issue with acne at all, but I was hoping this serum would lighten my previous acne scars and help with my complexion, but after almost 2 weeks of using this product, it‚Äôs made my skin so bumpy and itchy. I rarely wear makeup, but even wearing make up doesn‚Äôt look right. I really want a refund.Edit: TruSkin saw my review and immediately emailed me with an apology and offered a full refund with no return of this product.

  During this time of Covid-19 I'm taking the time to work on taking care of myself a little better (as a mom it's not been a high priority), and while I'm not into makeup, I'm into skin health!After reading all of the reviews, I decided to try this TruSkin Vitamin C Serum.It arrived quickly and I was so excited to try it. I started with applying the serum at night and noticed results the very next day. My skin just felt *better* in a way that's a little hard to describe.Quick description: I'm a 47 year old Californian that loves gardening and being in the sun so I have some sun spots, some fine wrinkles aka ""laugh lines"" around my eyes and mouth. My skin tone is a little uneven and dull and my skin feels a bit fragile and thin. I have had occasional breakouts along my chin line (which is super insulting to have lines *and* breakouts!). It seems like the older I get, the larger the pores on my nose got. :( Oh, and the circles under my eyes~ agh! Terrible.I've now been using this Vitamin C Serum for three weeks, my skin feels less fragile, my skin tone is evening out, the breakouts I used to get along my chin are diminishing~ and something I didn't even think was possible~ my pores are smaller!! :) I couldn't believe my eyes and I am SO PLEASED!After my positive results after such a short time using this serum, I wanted to try more of the TruSkin line. I was a little torn on what the next best product to add should be so I emailed TruSkin customer service and Erica promptly replied back with wonderful, helpful information, and guidance!I'm so pleased to not only have a product that I love and makes my skin look and feel better, but a company that is responsive, kind, and helpful is a company I will return to and continue to support!I've since ordered two more products- the Eye Gel and the C-Plus Super Serum and can't wait to get them!I'm a shopper that reads ALL the reviews and I rely on them, though I'll bashfully admit that I don't write as many as I ought to. I'm hoping this helps someone like me that is a little unsure or hesitant to make this purchase- just do it! :) And- I plan to update this review after I have used this Vitamin C serum longer than 3 weeks!

I am very grateful to them for their efforts and I intend to purchase over and over again.ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is the second time I have purchased this product, and I couldn't love it any more than I already do! It is truly a five-star serum and does everything it says it will; brightens complexion, evens out tone, reduces lines/wrinkles, etc. It does not irritate my sensitive skin, either. My issue with this product is not how it is formulated, it is how it is packaged. I got my second bottle last week and the inside of the packing envelope was all wet and sticky. Turns out the bottle cap/pipette was unscrewed from the bottle and A THIRD of the product leaked out. So I only got 2/3 of what I paid for. :( This product is the bees knees but I feel very cheated and would like my 1/3 bottle of product back. Sad day.

  Honestly, I don't really want to review it b/c if it becomes too popular it will sell out too quickly! This will forever be a part of my routine. I followed the rest of the reviewers and used the serum after derma rolling (my first time doing that) and in less than a week my under eye circles were noticeably less.  Can't wait to see after a couple months! So thankful I learned about the derma roller from the other reviews (thank you!!!)  I've had under eye circles since childhood and I can't tell you how cool it is to not see them in the mirror.  The derma roller followed by this Perfect TruSkin Serum has changed my life.

  So I wanted to wait awhile before I reviewed this product. I finished my first bottle and ordered a second when the first was running low. I will be a continued user because I do think it works. The biggest thing I noticed with me was that it helped with the little white pimples you get under the the eyes. Not sure why but it has helped tremendously with no more of them popping up. I think they are called milia (either way it seems to help with them not coming back). I use it once a day after I wash my face, takes a minute to dry and then I apply a moisturizer. The 1 oz bottle lasted me almost 6 weeks. Love the product and the way it makes my skin look.

The first time it caused a break out (2-3 pimples) I stopped using it and assumed it may be due to other factors. Second time I stuck to using it for one week and boy I should have listened to my body the first time. It cause another break out, worse than my face has ever seen(15 pimples) ! Puberty, heart break, stress, sleeping in makeup, indulging in fast food - none of these things have made it as bad. My goodness I blamed the pandemic, quarantine, and masks for it but nope nope just not meant for my skin. I stopped using it and within 2 days my skin was thanking me. So yep, careful my friend. I didn't give a terrible review being it seemed to be an issue with how it reacted with my skin is all. I'd tell you the kind I have but I have no clue, prob combo skin. Hope I helped some!

  I have been using this product for about three weeks and I saw a difference after only a few days.  I was super skeptical but figured for 20 bucks it was worth a shot.  Now three weeks later, my skin tone is much more even.  I have actually been leaving my house without makeup.  I would normally put on foundation and a bronzer but haven't felt the need to.  Yes, of course my skin still looks better with some foundation and bronzer, but I feel like it looks good enough to leave the house as-is during the day, without feeling like I look haggard.  I feel like I look more ""put together"" now.  I also have hyper pigmentation, which it did *not* help with.  I still use a bleaching cream at night on my melasma, then wait about 20 minutes and put this product over my whole face.  When I wake up in the morning, my skin looks great.  Before using this product, the bleaching cream would lighten my melasma, but dry out my face in those areas horribly and my face would be flaking all day.  But not with TruSkin C.  My skin looks brighter, more even and more supple.  Sometimes I don't even wash my face in the morning because it looks that good!  I basically use this product at night before bed.  Rarely do it use it twice a day b/c I pretty much only wash my face once a day now - at night.

  I used to live in Arizona and spent lots of time outdoor so got tons of sun spots. Some were really dark and big. My dermatologist gave me a cream with 4% hydroquinone, which works great to lighten the spot. But I don't want to use it for long term due to health concern. So I tried this one. I have been using this product for one month, both in the morning and at night before applying moisturizer. I think it works as well as hydroquinone in terms of reducing and lightening sun spots. The added benefit for me is the skin tightening effect. it's noticeable to me that my skin looks smoother and more even toned. one bottle would last about a month so I just placed another order for this product.

Of course, that was great news except for the fact that the serum cost over 100 bucks and lasted about 6 weeks. So i found this serum on here and let me tell you- it does the same thing as the 100 dollar serum.  Not only does it hydrate my skin, but it also is healing some acne scars.  I have combination skin and it has helped bring down the oily parts of my face to a minimum, and continually hydrates my face.  The price is amazing for this product.

  I've been using this serum now for 3 months and my complexion has transformed! I'm 35 and just realizing that I'm aging way too rapidly lol. I didn't think that slapping on some product is going to work wonders but a girl can wish. I have a pretty big age spots on my cheek that was getting darker and darker and after a few months of use it has faded and a lot less noticeable. I'm still documenting so I'm hopeful it will continue to get even lighter and maybe disappear lol My overall complexion is much brighter now and my skin feels supple and I've gotten some glow back. In just 3 months, I have to say I'm impressed and THANK YOU Truskin for giving me back my self confidence!

  I have acne prone, sensitive skin. After reading reviews I decided to try this. I spend ALOT on skincare. My last Vitamin C serum was Ole Henriksen. It had a wonderful smell... but I stayed a little broken out and it was $$. This is creamy, soft, zero scent to it and my skin is Clear and glowing. I had to see what the hype was about bc at $20 I was very skeptical. Well.... I love it! Try for yourself. And if you don‚Äôt love it, you didn‚Äôt spend too much. But you will love it! I only use in the morning. I wash, exfoliate then rub an entire dropper on my face and neck. Moisture and then apply my makeup. It‚Äôs perfect and easy. The positive reviews are accurate.

  We are all reading about how Vitamin C can help our skin and overall complexion.  I was excited to try this reasonably priced serum, but I can honestly say it wasn't that great after using the entire bottle.The product feels wonderful on your skin.  It goes in nicely and provides great hydration and smoothness.  However, that's about it.  I have noticed my skin is a bit softer, but no other benefits with completion or skin tone.

  I gave this a try but if I saw any difference it was negative.  I used it sporadically the first time.  I didn't see any improvement in my skin and set it aside.  Then I decided to try it again, but this time more consistently, so I applied it after cleansing every day for a month.  My skin did not look any better; in fact my rosacea looked a little worse, but that could have been due to other factors.  Next, I tried it on my hands and scalp.  Again, no improvement. The bottle and dropper are good quality and the ingredients look good, but the product just didn't make a difference for me.  Maybe it was too much of a good thing for my skin, or maybe I get enough Vit C through my diet so this is overkill.  Don't know, but I'm not a fan.

  Oh my I will never be without this.  I use it every 3rd or 4th night and it makes my skin smoother and brighter.  Vitamin C is a well-studied antioxidant that treats your skin right.  Taken orally it will also help the skin.  Vitamin C is not so stable and needs to be at a proper pH and this product does both.  It is easy to use and has no fragrance or consistency issues.  The four products that are essential for a good skin care routine are:1. Retinol  2. Glycolic acid  3. Hyaluronic acid  4.  Vitamin CTrukSkin is my favorite skincare line, the make excellent products at reasonable prices.  Do yourself a favor if you have texture or pigmentation issues, give this a try for a month.

When I first applied this serum on my face, it started stinging like crazy. Thinking it's just my skin acting up, and I wanted to give this product a solid try before I give up seeing as there were SOOOOO many good reviews. After 2-3 days of using this, this is what my face looked like vs what my skin looked like before using this product.EDIT: changed my review from 1 to 3 stars because of their AMAZING customer service. Not only did they offer a refund because the product didn't work out, they also spent some time asking about my skin type and recommended another product that may be more suitable for my skin type. I've went through a fair share of skin care products as well as companies (since my skin so extremely sensitive x.x), and TruSkin's customer service is by far the best and most genuine.

  Very disappointed in this. I have used other Vita C serums in the past and seen results, however this product doesnt look, feel or produce any kind results as all the supposed five star reviewers claim. I have used for almost a month and the only noticeable thing to remark on is that this product as well as their retinol serum are pumped up with more hyralonic acid than anything else which in theory will fool you into thinking it is hydrating and skin firming and erasing skin issues.I wanted to love this product but there has been absolutely no difference or change in the tone of my skin. A month worth of use should show some sort of difference if this product truly was legit. I feel dupped by the reviews once again on Amazon.

  AMAZING STUFF! This is the best and fastest solution for my acne scars/marks. I have dark skin and had a massive break out on my face from stress last year. The acne left dark, dark marks on my face (especially cheeks) that were just unbearable for me to see. I also had dark patches from things I tried when trying to clear it up (yeah, I looked bad). I gave up hope that my face would improve in the near future. It took months to see little improvement in the marks on my face without Vit. C, but only took WEEKS to clear up with it! The dark patches are gone, my scars have DRASTICALLY faded. I am not ashamed to show my face anymore! I'm really impressed and use it two times a day. Also, a little goes a long way. Have been using it for almost 2 months and still half full. Would definitely recommend and will keep in my regime.Also: mine came cloudy, but is still a good product. Nothing wrong with it. Still works. Smells fine. Not harmful. Don't worry if yours comes cloudy! It's supposed to!

  I'm 49 and I've been using the Vitamin C Serum for about 2 weeks, and I think I am seeing some positive results.  I've been using the serum once a day until my skin gets completely used to it, but eventually, I want to use it twice a day (Full disclosure: I'm also using a hyaluronic acid based moisturizer from another brand that I've used for over a year). So far, my skin does look and feel soft throughout the day, and I think I am beginning to see a little improvement in firmness and tone in my cheeks, which used to be very full ""apple"" cheeks, but thanks to gravity and age, are now showing some signs of sagging.  I am hoping that using the serum twice a day will, at the very least, keep the sagging in my cheeks from getting too much worse.  Looking forward to seeing how things are in another 2 weeks!

  I was skeptical about buying a facial serum online, but I am so glad I tried this. I've been using it for three weeks now in the morning and at bedtime along with the eye gel and I plan to purchase a bottle of serum every month. I'm applying a thin layer to my face, under chin, down neck, and front of my d√©colletage, which is a little less than one full dropper. It looks like one bottle will last a month at this rate.Within one week I saw the lines in my neck beginning to disappear a little. I'm almost 39 and I had very deep creases in my neck from years of looking down. The pores on my face are significantly smaller, the purple acne scars from my once a month cystic acne breakouts seem to be fading a little, and my face seems brighter and less red.I've had rosacea for over a decade and my sensitive skin usually responds badly to anything containing parabens, mineral oil, lanolin, chamomile, fragrances, and dyes. This product does not inflame my rosacea and sensitive skin, and I believe it is actually helping to diminish the redness on my cheeks and across my nose.I don't notice any bad smell and the texture of the product is nice. It applies smoothly after I wash my face and after a few moments, I moisturize. It is not heavy or sticky at all. So far I haven't experienced any residue balling up on my skin when I apply products or cosmetics on top of this product.After just over three weeks, the deep lines in my neck are so much improved that I do not notice them. Last weekend and the weekend before, I was actually asked to show my ID to get a glass of wine in two different restaurants, and both servers expressed shock when they saw my year of birth. It has been a long time since I had to show my ID, so I do not think these two instances were just coincidence. My fiance says he feels like the serum is rejuvenating my complexion noticeably,I'm very happy with the product and can't wait to see how my skin will improve in the future with continued use.

  So, not too impressed. But it is more of a natural ingredient product, which is a win.  My face is somewhat hydrated, I like it for that. Its best used with another oil, otherwise  I think this just sits on top of the face.  It has somewhat helped dark pigments fade.  It does help even skin tone. However, its not amazing results that you can notice right away. I used almost the full bottle before noticing anything. It wasn't  a horrible experience its just not the best product in my cabinet to rave about. If you just want an even skin tone, this might be a great option.

  I have never used a skincare product so effective at brightening my skin tone and adding vibrancy to my complexion. I wanted to start using vitamin C as so many dermatologists were recommending adding it to morning skincare routines. But I didn't want to spend a fortune on something at Sephora, so I stumbled across this. And it has made a noticeable difference within a month. I also suffer from acne and oily skin, so I was using a topical cream to combat acne in combination with this. In the morning, first, I spot apply my acne cream; then apply this serum all over; then a general moisturizer (especially in the dry winter); and then sunscreen. This routine has transformed my skin, and I rarely wear foundation anymore. Do NOT bother spending 80-100+ bucks on other serums. This one will do the trick for far less money.

  Since I began using it from the day of purchase (1/9), I have noticed positive changes on my skin. I started a new skincare routine so I bought it with the intention to use it with my derma rollers(0.2mm, 0.5mm).  I have a really sensitive and dry skin, so it is easy for my face to flare up in a reaction and become red.My routine is as follows: 1) cleanse 2) apply derma roller over face (frequency is every other night, starting with once a week or when my face has fully recovered) 3) apply Truskin Naturals Serum 4) apply hydro boost skin cream, eye cream, and vaseline. In the morning I would apply the hydro boost skin cream and sunblock. The only step I do not do every night is 2. I have noticed my skin growing lighter and my acne scars more shallow (before it was noticeably deep).Since I'm starting a completely new skincare routine, it's hard for me to tell where most of the improvements are coming from, though it probably is a culmination of all of these products. I would assume that the Vitamin C has been partially (if not all) responsible for my skin lightening, which was unexpected but not something I oppose to. Otherwise, no allergic reactions of any kind on my very sensitive face, and I'm very happy with the product and will continue to use it. Thank you!

  I‚Äôm 32 years old and my skin since the pandemic has gotten quite out of hand. The mask wearing and the feeling of being overwhelmed has really taken a toll on my skin. I‚Äôm breaking out like a teen that just hit puberty. It‚Äôs been rough lately.I saw all the reviews and thought, what‚Äôs it going to hurt. My cystic acne that‚Äôs been the size of boulders has started to subside and my dark spots are clearing up only after a week of use day and night. I‚Äôm really impressed by the product so far. Plan to update after a month of use, but so far so good.EDIT: Purchased my second bottle and so far so good. The 3 days I didn‚Äôt have this serum I noticed my dark spots didn‚Äôt change at all. The first day I got it again the next day the darks spots were slowly fading again. Again love this product!!!

  I really really wish I liked this product. I have no doubt this is a great product, it just wasn't a great product for me. I have sensitive skin that clogs easily. This product made my skin flare on my cheeks in my T-zone. I've been using it for almost two weeks and it's just not doing it for me. I use it every night and use a derma roller twice a week and not even my scarring is going away. My scarring is pretty minimal to begin with, but it's just not giving me any results. Again, I'm sure it's a terrific product, just not for me :(

  I was looking for a Vitamin C serum, and the reviews for this product were stellar, so I though I would go ahead and try it. As for any skincare product, there is a chance that it will not agree with your skin. This serum, unfortunately, did not agree with my skin. It made my skin feel smooth and hydrated, however it created some irritating texture. It just did not work for my specific skin type. I do NOT have sensitive skin, so there was no rhyme or reason for it, the product and I just weren't compatible. However, the customer service was some of the best I have encountered thus far. I received an email that asked me how the product was working for me. As soon as I replied that it was not the one for me, TruSkin was so amazing about the process of helping me out. Erica was so personable and helpful. It made the whole experience of trying and experimenting with different products extremely pleasant. Hopefully I can find a product from this brand that does work for me because they are outstanding as an overall company.

  I‚Äôve been searching for a good vitamin c serum and was hopeful this would be it, based on all the great reviews. I used it up, wanting to give it a good shot. I did not notice a difference in my skin. I saw some reviews that said they didn‚Äôt think it made a difference until they stopped using it,  but I didn‚Äôt notice a change even then. I found it pretty drying, but I live in Denver where the air is already pretty dry so maybe that was it.

  I received my order of the Truskin Vitamin C serum within a couple days. I read the reviews and was a bit hesitant because my skin can be sensitive. Upon delivery in was packaged in bubble wrap and was completely sealed.Now I'm 51 and for years I have ventured to find the Holy Grail in skin care products. I'm just a regular woman who can't afford those high end department store creams. I spent my younger years sunbathing and even some tanning beds. I quit doing all that a decade ago. So as I age I really wanted to focus on my skin. It's turned dull and the fine lines are beginning to creep.So I began to do a bit of research and read so many positive reviews about TruSkin C. And seeing pictures from women who were mature I was quite curious. The price was reasonable and I thought, what the heck, lets give it a try.....Well I've used it last night for the first time. I'm obsessed!!!! I never thought I would see much results let alone so quickly. I woke up with such glowing skin this morning. And my face feels so soft! I can hardly wait to see the results after a couple weeks. I love this serum !! I'm definitely going to make this part of my daily routine. I'm not even going to bother looking at other brands. Why would I. This is perfect!! Thank you, Erica for having such a great product. I'm going for the Retinol next. Can't wait!!!!Customer for life!

  I can't believe what I'm noticing in just 3 days!  Complexion is more even.  Less oily through the day.  Crows feet are becoming more fine rather then crapy.  I'm 3 weeks shy of turning 42 and I've never been more comfortable in my own skin then now.  I'm also experiencing melasma on my upper lip, but that will take more time to lighten.  Fingers crossed this will help with that as well.  Reviewers have said this has a bad odor, but I don't find that at all.  Someone mentioned it smelling a bit like leather, and I would agree.  But it's very light and dissipates in seconds.  I use 5 drops for my face and 3 for my neck in the morning.  Then put on sunscreen and moisturizer.  I feel like there's a firmness to my skin that I haven't felt in a long time.  Also, no breakouts since using.  I'm really excited to have found this and hope all this good stuff continues!

  I was so hopeful for this serum to work for me given all the positive reviews. I did a test patch for the first 48 hours as directed and had no problem. Then started using it just once a day at night before bed. Unfortunately I had an allergic reaction. After a few days, it began to dry out my skin and left it very itchy. Additionally, I was careful to keep it away from my eyes, but because of the way my skin reacted it caused my eyes to swell and become puffy when I woke up in the morning.  Since discontinuing two days ago, my skin is starting to return to normal and the swelling around my eyes has come down significantly.None of this is at the fault of the company. I do understand everyone's skin is different and what works for some, may not always work for others.

I know it‚Äôs says that is expected so I tried it out anyway. I‚Äôve been using this product for two months now on and off and every time I use it consistently for about a week something goes wrong. I started breaking out around my chin like never before (see pictures) I saw some reviews (that were later changed to five stars) with similar complaints. I also read about it giving you red, itchy, flaky skin almost like a sunburn! Same thing happened to me! At first I thought it was just my skin being sensitive to the cold air but after reading those similar reviews I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs this serum. Another commonality in reviews - redness and puffy ness around eyes almost like an allergic reaction!! I had to go to a dermatologist for the first time in my life after using this product and I couldn‚Äôt figure out what was going on with my skin but after reading similar issues I am convinced it‚Äôs this vitamin C serum. Beware of this product because it doesn‚Äôt work well for everyone.

  I have so many things to say about this product AND customer service. Please read.For starters, I read most of the reviews for the product and all of them were quite impressive. I decided to give it a shot. I am a face care junkie, and have tried EVERYTHING!!! I'm 32, I do not have too many wrinkles, but I want to take care of my sun damaged skin from back in the day when ""tanning with baby oil"" was cool. After going to the dermatologist and seeing what was under my skin ( a complexion analysis) I was horrified! All of that damage will make its way to the surface and expose sunspots and again by the time I'm 40. Prevention is key.I ordered the Facewash, Serum, toner, and eye gel.I have been using all 4 up to twice a day. My face feels baby soft. The fine lines around my eyes are vanishing. The puffiness under my eyes is GONE! I don't wake up with bags at ALL. I'm sold on all of these products.CUSTOMER SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING! I have never received a personal one on one email from any company from amazon that I've made a purchase from. I received an email from a nice lady named Erica who just wanted to check in and make sure I was enjoying their products. She also asked if there was anything I disliked and anything she could do to help. I'm blown away with the customer service at TruSkin.Let me also add that I was no paid for this whatsoever. I'm just a country girl from Mississippi addicted to taking care of my sun-damaged skin and felt compelled to leave a review from my results thus far and the kind email I received after my purchase.

  I just got this two days ago and I‚Äôm LOVING it!!! Here‚Äôs REALLY IMPORTANT INFO when it comes to using hyaluronic acid. It absolutely NEEDS WATER to work, lack of it will result in drying out your skin. SO if you don‚Äôt live in a humid area then you have to use water with any hyaluronic acid. For me I use it when I come out of the shower, I don‚Äôt dry my face but rather let it dry naturally a little until it‚Äôs still quite moist. I add this hyaluronic acid to my fingers & then smooth & press all over my face. Then after a minute I add another spritz of water to my face to lock that water in and let it work it‚Äôs magic. If you don‚Äôt provide it the water, it can‚Äôt do what it‚Äôs meant to do! After my face has almost dried I then press in a few drops of marula oil & at night I follow with a thicker moisturizer.

  I bought this because my doctor said vit c serum is the best thing for your skin.... She gave me a sample bottle from her office of a different product that is more expensive so i figured this would be a good alternative to not spending $200. Unfortunately this product was not great for my skin type, maybe my skin is too sensitive, but I broke out around my eyes with painful bumps and had painful bumps and red dryness on my cheeks.I know you might be wondering why Id give something 5 stars that I had some sort of reaction to. I was contacted by Erica, a member of TruSkin through email. She was more than helpful and noted that I was probably had some sort of allergic reaction to the serum. Not only did she refund the total amount of my order, but she wanted to know more. We emailed back and forth about what product my own doctor had given me (the $200 serum I was trying to save some money from ordering) and she compared the ingredients to some of the products from this company. She then took it upon herself to send a different more fitting product after doing some research for me as a gift from this company.I have never had an experience like this from amazon before. This company really went above and beyond to make sure I had a good experience with them. I wouldn't be writing this if I wasn't extremely impressed.

  I was excited to try this product from all the buzz it has gotten on social media. Vitamin C is a great skin care option for brightening your skin and serums are a great way to get that. But this product I found it to be not useful at all. It made my skin itchy and it did not absorb into my skin at all like I had expected it to. I dove into the ingredients list a little more after my bad reaction.MSM - while Methylsulfonylmethane is relatively safe if you ingest it for no more than 3 months (inflammation relief) there is no studies shown what it does as a topical. No fly zone for me.Witch Hazel - this can dry and strip your skin. It‚Äôs not what you think it is!Phenoxyethanol - pretty much a fragrance and can chase eczema and issues in infants born to mothers who have been exposed.I‚Äôm really sad this wasn‚Äôt a better product.

  Bought this item back in January and I wanted to wait and use the product for a decent amount of time before reviewing it. This product paid for itself within the first week I used it. I suffer from cystic hormonal adult acne so I'm pretty much always breaking out and this baby dries breakouts up faster than anything I've ever used and trust me, I've used just about everything over the counter. For those wondering, I didn't notice that this caused less breakouts, nor did this fade out any existing hyperpigmentation. Prior to this serum, i had been using 10% benzoyl peroxide to treat my acne topically and it works wonderfully to dry out blemishes, however it leaves your skin super dry and flakey to the point where your makeup looks flakey, even if you used a serum or moisturizer beforehand. That's why I love this serum because it gets rid of acne without drying out your skin. The only reason why I do still keep benzoyl peroxide onhand is because it kills the bacteria that causes acne and this serum doesn't have the ability to do that. I tend to breakout in the same areas over and over because of underlying bacteria. Bottom line buy this. I just repurchased, but in the 2oz size this time. Love this stuff and I see myself using it for as long as it continues to be sold.

  *UPDATE*:After I posted my negative review, TruSkin's Erica reached out to me and asked me about my experience with it, and I told them the same thing as in my review. They apologized and kept true on their word for offering the refund, and sent me a receipt for them issuing the refund. So, if you do order this, you don't need to be afraid of wasting money! This five star review isn't exactly for the product but for them fulfilling their end of refunding unhappy customers. I can't say I recommend the product since it did nothing for me, but you're not losing either if you don't like it.*ORIGINAL REVIEW*:When I received it, it was cloudy and the company sends a card that says it can be clear to cloudy in consistency but it should still work. Apparently, if the consistency is foggy and opaque, it's apparently lost most of it's benefits for the skin, and I feel like that's true with this product. I've been using it for the last three weeks, and it goes on smooth, absorbs, but I've seen no difference. I've been using it everyday, and I've seen no difference. No brightness or anything, and my skin feels pretty much the same as before. It's really disappointing, especially since the review are really great for this product. Maybe if mine was clear it'd actually work, but I'm not going to spend another $20 to find out if it does work. Maybe in the future, but for now I'd give this product a pass.On the bright side it didn't damage my skin and burn or irritate it.

I was so skeptical but now I see what all the great reviews are all about. I feel silly for paying so much more for expensive brands now. I have also used other skin lighting products that made my face burn and this one is good for sensitive skin! I wish I would‚Äôve found this sooner. I use it once a day before bedtime under my body Mary night cream. I could also use it during the day under makeup but it‚Äôs not necessary for me.

  So I wanted to use this product before I wrote a review. I got it originally because it looked comparable to the ultra glow serum from Sephora, which is my go to serum. Unfortunately I was only able to use this a few times before throwing the bottle away out of frustration. This made my skin SO DRY it was unbelievable. I tried it a few more times to make sure and yep, every time ended in the same result. If you‚Äôre looking for a good serum I recommend the Ultra Glow Vitamin C serum from Sephora! It‚Äôs around the same price as this and good for sensitive skin! I will be sticking to that from now on.

    Effective and Definitely Affordable Vitamin C Serum

  I have bought TruSkin's Vitamin C serum twice now and definitely plan to purchase once I run out again.  It has been three months now, and this serum helps me hydrate my combination skin.  When I learned about sezia.co from watching one of Hyram's YouTube videos, I started double checking the ingredient lists from potential products I considered buying.  This formula is definitely malassezia folliculitis safe and does not contribute to fungal acne!  This little bottle met all of my requirements in a skin care brand:  it's cruelty-free, vegan, is free from malassezia folliculitis causing agents, it is helping me clear up my post-acne marks AND my biggest reason is that it is affordable.  For anyone who is considering to venture to try a vitamin C serum, I definitely recommend this one from TruSkin.

    READ ME if you have dry skin!
  
",3.0 ,Cicily,"Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2021","









  
  
    
  This serum is very light but not moisturizing. It actually dried out my skin pretty bad. After application, I felt a slight burning sensation that I didn't think much about because I thought it would go away, but it never did. So at the end of the day when I realized the burning never stopped, I started running my fingers along my cheeks to see where exactly it was coming from and I felt scratches on my face! However, I hadn't been scratching my face. So I looked in the mirror and I didn't see any red marks, but my face was very dry and peeling. I'm so bummed because of the great reviews. But I guess it just doesn't work for everyone. A lot of people seem to have benefited from it, so it's worth a try. Oh! And maybe it had something to do with the fact that I use a 10% benzoyl peroxide face wash? Anyways, it's a no for me.UPDATE: I've read that hyaluronic acid can have the opposite effect of it's purpose (moisturizing) when applied to already dry skin. When it's used on dry skin in a dry climate, it actually starts pulling moisture FROM your skin instead of drawing moisture from the air INTO your skin. I believe that's what happened to me. Anyways, a lovely representative named Erica reached out to me a week or two later and offered to help me find something better for my skin, which is above and beyond my expectation for any business. I am used to accepting refunds and being on my merry way, but it shows a genuine care for customers when businesses offer to help you solve your problems.Hope this helps!

  First note: it's an effective serum and I saw improvement in some dark spots I had left over from acne that had healed. The most dramatic difference was that I saw a lightening of my under eye circles which was really cool because I wasn't expecting it. My only complaint was that the product didn't seem to last long for me, and when I got an email from the company asking how this worked for me, I mentioned my complaint and now I assume the length of the product use was because I was using more than I needed each night. So the bottom line is yes it works, but even better, the customer service is lovely and the company seems to care a lot about what people think rather than some companies I've run across that you never hear a word from.

  I never do reviews. That being said, this product does exactly what it is supposed to do. My skin is already changing after a few weeks of usage.

My marks aren‚Äôt completely gone yet, but they are continuing to fade and I‚Äôve been using the product for about a month. I will keep using because I am convinced that this is the key secret to glowing skin. It feels light weight when I put it on in the morning and then I wear my revision intellishade moisturizer over it, along with my eye cream. I wish someone would have encouraged me to use this years ago. It‚Äôs like a secret ingredient and I just feel so good about my skin finally!

  Just got my bottle of this, I actually found out about it on a bloggers page. she was recommending mad hippie vitamin C serum and someone asked for a more potent formula and she suggested this so I decided to try it out and I am soo glad I did! I get blemished skin from popping my blackhead and pimples and then my skin gets ruined and looks ugly for a few weeks and I have to use extra makeup to cover up my damaged skin. This serum literally took only 4 days to get to me. Package was in tact and today is my first time using it and within the few hours it has been on my face, I noticed my blemishes are getting lighter, ALREADY! I can't wait to see what they look like tomorrow or in a week! People say it makes your skin dry and it does feel dry at first but you got to let it settle in on the skin for awhile, if it does make your skin feel dry or taught, mix it with a little bit of vitamin E, I mixed mine with vitamin E because I feel like my skin needs the extra help right now. This product works well! I am very surprised at how quickly it started working! Very happy with it (so far)! Try it out!

  I have been using this product for over 2 months, now.  I am always a bit skeptical about beauty products, in general.  However, I had read about the benefits of topical vitamin C for the skin, as vitamin C is used by the body for collagen production.  I thought I would give it a try.When I first used the serum, I was already pleased with the way my skin felt to the touch after application.  Then I noticed over time that my overall complexion was improving.  I have been using a nighttime moisturizer for some time by a different manufacturer, and when I added this to my regimen, applying at first in the daytime, under my make-up, I began to notice a visible reduction in fine lines.I used the first bottle twice a day. I was very consistent and did not skip a day of application. I think consistency is the key, here.  I have since gone back down to once a day application in the morning (but I will apply a little on my forehead at night since I have the most fine lines there).  I went back to once a day application, not for any skin irritation or anything like that, but simply because it is a little more economic for me at the moment.I am very pleased with the product and will continue to use it as part of my regimen.  The company customer service is very friendly and helpful, and really appreciate feedback on their product.

  THE BEST and most inexpensive serum I've ever purchased. It works wonders, and the price is divine.I've used many serums previously and loved the results, but hated the price!.This worked just as well as the super expensive products I purchased, maybe better. It's super light, with little or no fragrance and doesn't irritate my skin (I have very sensitive skin). It's extra effective when used with my Dermal Roller once or twice a month. I have very tiny milia (small hard bumps that look like whiteheads but aren't) around my hairline. They are impossible to extract at home, you must go to a dermatologist. I no longer have a problem with milia; this Serum gently exfoliates them and they self-extract!I would most definitely recommend this product for anyone in the market for an inexpensive effective face serum.

",5.0 ,Dana Morningstar,"Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this because I heard it worked well to use after derma rolling. This serum really helps to tighten your skin! I've used it for about two weeks now. I have an oily t-zone, and it dried my skin out in that area after about 4 days--to the point where my skin was flaky. I decided to alternate with a moisturizer for the day and to use this stuff at night, and now my skin looks amazing. I can't tell you how much I've tried and spent over the years trying to shrink my pores as I have always been self-conscious about my sebaceous filaments on my nose and cheeks. I've done chemical peels, facials, enzyme scrubs, you name it. I've come to terms with using face primer to spackle over them lol. Within ten days they've pretty much all dried up! I totally didn't expect this result and couldn't be more thrilled.  I examine my skin in the mirror closely each time I go into the bathroom. Seriously. This morning I woke up and my skin looked so good that I was upset with myself for a second about falling asleep with my makeup on, and then I remembered that I did wash my face--my skin just looks even and fresh now! Freaking crazy. This serum is absolute gold. Just make sure to not put it around your eyes as it will dry them out big time, and if your skin gets too dry, alternate with a moisturizer (I recommend their Vit C moisturizer).

  I've tried many Vitamin C serums and this one is my absolute favorite so far!I've tried Banish, Timeless Skincare, Seoul Ceuticals, some other brand from walmart, and by far TruSkin and Seoul Ceuticals are my absolute favorite. The reason why I love this one is because of the immediate results literally the next day. Beforehand, I had a lot of redness and dry patches and a few acne. My face now is so supple and clear and I haven't seen it like this in a while. It has a very dewy glow to it now and the redness has subsided and I no longer have dry patches after using the whole bottle.I don't normally do reviews but honestly I am truly astonished by theresults! I read the reviews and thought it may have been too good to betrue and maybe the reviews were fake, but I was mistaken. I definitely would recommend and give this a 5 star!Side note: The customer service as well is exceptional! They emailed me just to ask for my input on the product and I normally would ignore that in my email but lowkey I responded because I was truly happy with the results!Try this product you won't regret it.FENTY SKIN IS COMING YALL.

  I have spent a lot of money in sephora and Ulta looking for a miracle serum to get rid of my dark spots for the last 3 years, something changed and I started out with mild adult acne that later turned into a stress picking systematic ordeal which left me with nasty dark spots. I've also spent lots of money buying concelers to hide and not feel judged by anyone talking to me face to face. I haven't really changed anything in my diet really except eating papaya LOL I wash my face 3 times a week with Kate's Somerville acne pink wash (its new and its pink I just don't remember the name) and I shake my little bottle of truskin and a few drops all over and massage in. I used to do a toner, i no longer do that cause i don't find it necessary, I also don't wear a lotion after it because my face gets very oily and I live in Florida. I do wear a mild face sun block from Clinique I think but there's been times I've forgotten and my dark spots have not gotten darker with truskin. Like I said I don't use it often or every night but it's doing something and I'm super excited to keep seeing results. I've also used it on my husband once and his skin was baby soft üòç. The picture on the left (pink shirt) is from today, the picture on the right is from 2 months ago. The sides of my face were very bad.

  So I have been using this serum for a about a month.  At first I was like ""I don't see any difference.""  But now, after it's been a month of continuous usage (morning and night), my skin just looks better.  It seems to not look as dreary or pasty.  I have not noticed any decrease in wrinkles or any other miracles, but I will continue to use it because I do see a difference.  I use about one full dropper full each time I apply - using a little more on my problem areas like my forehead wrinkles.  Whatever is left after applying to my face and neck, I apply to my chest.  It absorbs really quickly, which is a huge plus.

  Update (9/19) - the seller contacted me without my prompting - soley based on my previous review. I have to say that after several email exchanges I am impressed by this vendor showing interest in their customer's feedback and following up on it. I adjusted my serum usage due to my sensitive skin and the drying is no longer an issue. Although the mosturizer is 'heavy' I still use it daily for my neck and chest. Thanks to Erica for the great customer service.Previous review:I decided to try this (have used a serum similar to this in the past that was recommended by my dermatologist years ago) but this one is too drying. I have adjusted that amount used and the frequency. Will continue to test out my change over the next two months to see what happens. My skin is very sensitive and s=when I switch things up it shows.

  My super dry skin loves this stuff. It soaks in quickly & leaves my face feeling like nothing's even on it (although I always follow up with moisturizer). I feel like all women have better skin days than others so I'm not sure if my good days are due to luck or if it's this stuff helping. I do use it at least once a day sometimes twice. ALSO it worked amazing for the day I went on the boat & my face got burnt. I always try to protect my face but waited too long to apply sunscreen, well this stuff had the redness GONE by morning & my skin never peeled!

  Hello my fellow amazon-lovers. First I want to say that I never write reviews... but I am just TOO excited to not share my results with you. A little bit of a background first- I am 23 years old, a medical student, with very TIRED, acne-prone, and dull skin. I have struggled with acne throughout my entire adolescent and adult life. I have used many products all over the market--including Proactiv, Proactiv+, birth control, and nearly every drug store product you can think of. Some things will keep my acne at bay, but....the years of heavy chemicals trying to treat my acne has definitely hurt the integrity of my skin. I have had new fine lines, wrinkles, HEAVY bags, and dark circles. I started doing research on skin care and decided to completely re-vamp my beauty routine. If you care about your skin, you should not hesitate in purchasing this serum. To be very fair with you, I need to explain my daily routine--and ALL the products I use (some from amazon, some from the drugstore. but all reasonably affordable). My skin is still not perfect. I do have a few blemishes that will pop up, but as for my skin overall... it has helped tremendously. These are my TWO WEEK results using this serum. Yes. I said it... TWO WEEKS. I do plan on updating this in a few months. Now, I will list below my entire CURRENT routine. Once again, DON'T HESITATE.Morning:1.) Cleanse with Burt's Bees gel acne cleanser - Drugstore  ***Not my favorite, but it is gentle and it's not causing more breakouts. I will likely be switching this soon.2.) Tone with Simple Soothing toner - Drugstore  ***Nice, not irritating, I would recommend for those battling redness. I am thinking about trying new toners as well.3.) TruSkin Vitamin C Serum!!!! - Amazon  **** HOLY GRAIL. I use approximately the size of a dime in my hand. Allow to fully dry/absorb.4.) Olay Regenerist Microsculpting Cream with SPF 30 -Drugstore  **** I adore the texture of this. It's a perfect moisturizer and make-up primer. I would suggest it for all skin types.5.) Bae Body Eye Gel (Amazon)Makeup:I do not wear makeup every day. However, I have permanently switched to Neutrogena skin clearing foundation (drugstore). I apply with a new disposable makeup wedge each time. It is a medium coverage foundation, and it DOES NOT cause breakouts (at least for me).Night:1.) Cleanse with Burts Bees.2.) Tone with Simple.3.) First layer of TruSkin Vitamin C Serum.4.) Dermaroller!!!!!!  ****Ever heard of this? I was skeptical too. A dermaroller is a small roller that is covered with microneedles. You roll it on your skin to increase  collagen production and increase absorption of skincare products. The one I purchased was a 0.25 mm roller from the brand Sdara  (Amazon). There are many to buy and many to choose from. I would recommend reading reviews first before your purchase! I roll for 3-5  minutes all over my face. It does not cause any bleeding, however there will be some slight redness and it might burn. No worries, it should  be gone by morning.5.) Second layer of TruSkin Vitamin C Serum. Wait for it to be fully dry and absorbed. Your face will be tight, with slight tingling or burning.6.) TruSkin Retinol Moisturizer. (Amazon)7.) Bae Body Eye GelI do not promise that this will work for anyone, but it has helped me tremendously and in a very short time. I do believe though that consistency is KEY.I have not been in contact with ANY of the companies who's products I have reviewed. TruSkin has not given me a discount or anything for this review. I am just an honest girl hoping to spread the word on what has brightened me up. If you have any hesitation, Don't. Give it a try. I hope this helps someone.XOEDIT: The second photo is my 2 month results!!! My skin is more even, brighter, and I‚Äôm still seeing improvements. Thank you TruSkin!

  This product saved my skin. I did NOT receive this at a discount and this is NOT a sponsored review. I seldom write reviews but just had to review this product. I‚Äôve been struggling with acne for YEARS. I have very acne-prone skin. I get a new pimple almost every day and it seemed like there was never a time I didn‚Äôt have a pimple on my face. Acne leaves super dark blemishes/scars on my face. I do believe my acne is partly genetic - another reason may be stress from college and not getting enough sleep. I‚Äôve tried all different types of moisturizers and cleansers. Nothing worked. However I bought this serum on a whim. Omgggg. Guys. Literally my face stopped flaring within 3 days. I was PIMPLE FREE FOR MORE THAN 48 hours (a new record). In the photo, the left side was day 1 of applying serum. As you can see I had extremely dark blemishes and active pimples.  The photo to the right shows my skin exactly 2 months later. Blemishes have faded DRASTICALLY and I have no active breakouts. This hasn‚Äôt happened in years. I truly and honestly think it is due to this product. If you are hesitant, don‚Äôt be BUY IT!- I cleanse my face every morning and night with Burt‚Äôs Bees deep cleansing cream, then moisturizer and follow it with 3 drops of this serum (one drop for each cheek + chin and one drop for my forehead).It has also helped my under eye bags (use one drop for both undereyes; pat gently with fingers.)

  I will post more pics when I notice a more significant change. I wanted to address the myth I've seen blasted all over the reviews posted here.I have heard for a long time that vitamin c and retinol cannot be used together. That they cancel each other out. It's completely untrue. My problem is that I've heard it so many times. I believed it to be fact regardless of the sources I heard it from. Which is basically word of mouth by other women who do not hold a dermatological degree of any sort. I did my own research. And actual skin care experts that hold a degree say the opposite. Retinol CAN be used with vitamin c products. Successfully. They don't cancel each other out. They work beautifully together. And vitamin c actually helps retinol work BETTER by stabilizing it and extending its effectiveness. It turns out that using retinol without vitamin c or any other potent antioxidant is keeping your skin from reaping all the benefits of using retinol!!! Which is why this serum is so important in your skin care regimen. You know all those expensive anti aging moisturizers you've been blowing your money on? Well........without using this serum or any other serum close to this that has vitamin c in it prior makes your fancy skin cream ineffective. And we all want to get the most out of the money we spend to make our skin look fabulous. Don't we?I've also seen reviews on here about this product complaining about the color change in the serum. Did they not read about the product? I states very clearly that it's normal to see variations of color. Clear or cloudy. All depending on the time of the year the ingredients are harvested contribute. And it is very clearly addressed in the description of this product. Pretty much cancelling out any of the bad reviews made on this product.Ladies. If you want to make the most out of your skin care products. Read up on them first. That's why the info is there. So If anyone has any complaints on this product. They are not using it correctly!!!!!I've included a photo in the first week of use. I will post more down the road. I am 40 years old. I smoked heavily for over 20 years(quit January 2017) and drank pretty bad too for 13 years before I got sober 7 years ago. My skin was terrible!!!! I have absolutely no makeup on. Just moisturizer and carmex lip balm. I use this product with a retinol moisturizer. I also take collagen daily as well. Hopefully this review helps clear up the myths of using certain anti aging products together. And their (in)effectiveness. Us ladies gotta stick together in this war on aging and kick some wrinkle butt!!!! Lol!üí™üí™üí™

  I bought this product about a month ago and I use it at least once a day, sometimes twice. I started noticing a difference in my skin within a week! For the record, I have terrible skin. It's red, blotchy, uneven, and on top of that I would get terrible breakouts. I chose to post some before and after pictures because even though my skin is still not perfect this product has helped A LOT! It helped reduce the redness of my breakouts within a few days of using it and I'm convinced that it has also helped prevent more breakouts. This past month I've only had about 2 bad pimples (which is great for me since I used to get a new pimple every couple of days) but other than that my face has been doing great!The top 2 photos were taken the day I got the product and the bottom two photos are the results after about a month of using the product!

  I got swept by all the good reviews of this product on Amazon and by all the beauty gurus and influencers on YouTube, touting the benefits of Vitamin C serum. I caved and bought this product based on the glowing reviews saying how much this serum has changed their skin and brightened it. I have dry, sensitive skin so I did a patch test for a few days and everything seemed great. I was hoping it could brighten my dull skin and possibly reduce my dark circles. I used it morning and night, applying a few drops before my oils or moisturizer.  I didn't see a beneficial change in my skin. Instead, I developed a weird kind of skin condition that was acne-like without the normal whiteheads of pimples. I had this for months and used every over-the-counter acne product that my skin normally responds well to. Nothing worked.I've done extensive research on my skin condition and found out that I have Malassezia folliculitis, fungal ""acne"". Nothing in my normal routine could have been the culprit, other than this TruSkin serum. I'm guessing since Vitamin C is an antioxidant, this serum may have destroyed the reactive oxygen species on my skin but also got rid of the good, normal flora of my skin, leading me to develop an overgrowth of Malassezia. In addition, who knows if the exact concentration of Vitamin C in this serum? Was my bottle contaminated with fungus? I deeply regret purchasing and using this product. Beware of beauty gurus and aestheticians who are not board-certified dermatologists, trying to persuade you to buy and use products that you don't need. I was blessed with good skin genetics and I've ruined my skin with this product. Now I am left with small, bumpy and resistant fungal acne that refuses to go away. I can't use my usual products since they are not considered fungal-acne safe. Thanks for nothing, TruSkin. Do yourself a favor and stick to a simple skin routine. Whatever you do, don't buy this serum.

  Apparently I‚Äôm allergic to something in this serum because i had a major reaction to it after just using it for a couple days. I wasn‚Äôt even putting it on my eyes and they puffed up and became super itchy and irritated. I‚Äôm sure this doesn‚Äôt happen to everyone, but I will not be buying this again and I‚Äôm hoping to get a full refund. Adding a super embarrassing photo as well just to prove that it really did swell up my face.
