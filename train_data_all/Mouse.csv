    minimal, but sturdy, mouse
  
",5.0,kristenS,"Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2017","









  
  
    
  This mouse isn't flashy, minimal buttons, but you know? Where others have fallen after the repeated misshandling of my mice,  this one has survived many drops onto hard surfaces, moving, and just general bad handling that comes from 5 year Olds, and still works like a charm on pretty much any surface i've used it on,to include shiny boxes as i needed to do homework while moving to a new house. So, yeah, I'll give this thing a 5 star rating.

    Great mouse. Very basic
  
",5.0,Kateri Drewes,"Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2015","









  
  
    
  Great mouse. Very basic, but well constructed. I've been using it regularly, but it's had no issues despite frequent plugging and unplugging, constant transit, and frequent bending on the cord.Good sensor, works on basically all surfaces.Edit: So after a three months of frequent use, my mouse broke. This is the second time I have ordered this mouse, and both times it broke the same way. The base of the USB cord, where it connects to the computer, needs to be held at a very particular angle to work. The quality of the connection degrades until the mouse no longer works at all.I don't regret purchasing this mouse, but going forward I think I'll buy wireless mouses. I'd rather spend $25 on a wireless mouse which lasts me a couple years than spending $7 every three months because the connector cable keeps busting on my mouse.

    Works, but Mouse Wheel Squeaks
  
",3.0,PaulV,"Reviewed in the United States October 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  This mouse is solid and gets the job done, but the scroll wheels of both of the ones we bought squeak!  Is annoying enough that we can't use them.  Maybe others wouldn't be bothered, but even my coworkers on calls can hear the squeaking and it's distracting.  Tried a drop of oil but that didn't help.  So 3 stars for otherwise working, but just can't use this mouse otherwise.

  Sometimes the left button doesn't do anything. But, this might be my computer acting up. Don't know. However, the wheel gets into a mood once in a while and makes a scraping noise as you use it. That goes and comes at will (not wheel). This is a tiny bit annoying.  But for a bargain mouse, I'll work with it. I'm slowly switching to a tablet anyway.

  I was looking for a cheap mouse to use for a couple of months and was excited to find that AmazonBasics had an option.  Unfortunately, this mouse is so small my (larger then average) hand tends to cramp up after a few minutes of trying to squeeze it sufficiently.  There are plenty of other cheap options that feature a full size mouse.  This is more like a travel mouse.

  I grew tired of the wireless mice not working after a few months. Typically with those, the left side goes wonky, not to mention the batteries they go through. This plugs right in and hasn't had any issues thus far. Seems to be built like anything else on the market. It has a great click and tracks well.The only minor complaint is lack of additional buttons such as forward and back, which I was spoiled by. Outside of this small personal thing, this works well.

  Bought in September, lasted until January when it started confusing right and left clicks. It's not a huge issue, but makes a lot of things way more difficult than they need to be.I do a lot of gaming though, so it's likely it's just not built for that kind of wear and tear. Perfect if you're just using it for work purposes though. Not good for extensive gaming.

    THE ANSWER TO WHAT WORKS WITH THE HP CHROMEBOOK
  
",5.0,Donn M. Searle,"Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2014","









  
  
    
  __Shipment was well-packaged and arrived on time. I plugged the mouse into a USB port on my wife's HP-11 Chromebook and it worked instantly. This is a comfortable, optical mouse with long cord (which excess I gathered into a closed loop, next to the USB plug-in and secured by a couple of electrical ties), with very smooth tracking on a conventional mousepad.__So, to clear up the confusion of what will and what won't work on the HP-Chromebook:HP CHROMEBOOKS ARE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CHROMEBOOKS-Unlike their competitors, they were engineered at Google; not Hewlett-Packard. They do not contain the drivers that others may have built into their systems -DESPITE the fact that they are Bluetooth-enabled. No external apps, drivers or programs can be uploaded into the Google Chrome O.S. While that may be viewed as a shortcoming in Chromebook comparisons, the HP has in my opinion, superior features that negate that difference.THE HP CHROMEBOOKS WILL RUN ON A CORDED MOUSE, WITH NO SET-UP, RECEIVER OR BATTERIES REQUIRED! And the Amazon Basics 3-Button mouse fills the bill at a very reasonable price. My only recommendation would be, for shipping to add a brick of cheddar cheese with their mouse.-For the operator.

    Cheap, reliable, rugged, doesn't bounce under furniture when dropped
  
",5.0,Carole,"Reviewed in the United States January 22, 2015","









  
  
    
  This mouse is perfect for me. Many people prefer wireless mouses to wired ones like this mouse. I have two objections to having a wireless mouse:1. When a wireless mouse falls, it always seem to bounce way underneath furniture and searching for it on my hands and knees is not my favorite activity at age 66.2. Buying and replacing batteries frequently gets so tiresome.This mouse addresses both of these problems. If I drop it, I can retrieve it easily since the wire functions like a tether. It never needs batteries. What a great technological advance! Ha ha! Also it is a perfect fit for my hand and feels very natural. Like most AmazonBasics items this mouse functions well and is reliable. As a bonus the buttons produce very satisfying click sounds. This is what a mouse should be like, in my opinion, and the price is good at $6.99.Edited to add: I am now 69, and for whatever reasons, I probably drop my mouse from the table to the floor at least a dozen times a day. I'm not even kidding, and attribute this to old age and clumsiness. THIS MOUSE IS INDESTRUCTIBLE!!!! LOL  This would be a great mouse for a kid, too, because it just doesn't break. I guess I get a new one every couple of years, but still, this mouse is the very definition of the word ""rugged"".

  After buying two Apple mice (?) to use with my MacBook Pro, and having BOTH of them fail miserably ~ for over $60 apiece!! ~ I found this one on Amazon for a mere $7!! I ordered the first one a while back, it connected immediately ~ and until recently (probably after couple of years use at least) I have just started having an issue with it. Sometimes, while scrolling up/down, I find that the wheel does not connect.So...I ordered another one, again for a mere $7 (hear me, Apple?!?) to keep on hand for when the first one finally decides to bite the dust.As of today, I have not had to use this 2nd one, but it sits in my ""stash"" of equipment, silently awaiting the day when I will find that I need it.The 1st, as I have said, is still scrolling(for the most part) & clicking away, but I know that it will probably give out eventually...Again, 5* stars to a well-made purchase!!!

  Works well, should have read the reviews because it is a dainty mouse. I don't have large hands and it still feels small to me. Would probably be great for a child or someone with very small hands, like Donald Trump.The material feels good and it works great, and no irritating corners or edges. Other than the size, I have no complaints. If you have larger hands, look around and you can find other alternatives at this price-point.

    Super sqeaky scroll wheel
  
",1.0,Dave B,"Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  I just bought this instead of the Logitech as I have had decent results with Amazon Basics products in the past and it was slightly cheaper.  It was the wrong choice this time.  Amazon Basics products are usually missing one or two nice features, but other than that, are solid replacements at a decent price.  This mouse however has started to change my perception of the Amazon Basics brand for the worse.  Reading some of the other reviews, it appears that they created a decent product originally and then started cutting corners over time until the value provided was not worth the price, even though discounted.The scroll wheel squeaks whenever I use it.  And if I am using the mouse with a window, then I am scrolling quite a bit.  This is not an old mouse, I just bought and started using this mouse.  It grates on my ears and saps my concentration.  For the price, it is not worth the trip to the UPS store to return it.  I will probably just save it with a note to only give or lend it to someone I don't like very much. ;-)  Or realistically use it while waiting for a decent mouse if another mouse stops working.

  We had the original mouse from our computer that we bought waaaaay back in 2008 and it was getting to be pretty frustrating to use. I saw this for $7 and figured why not? I'm so happy I made the purchase. It shipped super fast and for a $7 mouse it is everything it should be and maybe a little better than I expected. Of course like I said before our old mouse was a complete turd so that is the context I'm going off of but still, the AmazonBasics mouse seems to be extremely responsive, comfortable, and it was plug and play which was nice. I had it unboxed and functioning in about 30 seconds. It works perfect for what we use it for (internet browsing, light gaming, general computer usage) and I don't really see why I would ever need anything fancier.

   It’s small which makes it a nice fit into a laptop bag. It doesn’t use batteries so that’s great but the pros don’t go much further than that. I haven’t had problems with the clicking yet like others have reported but my scroll wheel just stopped working. I’ve seen videos on YouTube that teach you how to open and repair this yourself but I really don’t want to. I honestly really liked this before things started breaking on me. I might buy another but judging by the reviews here these aren’t very well made. Do yourself a favor and skip this buy.

  I just wanted a basic mouse to use with my laptop and I didn't want to spend a lot on one. This fit my needs perfectly. It did the job, it scrolled easily, fit my hand nicely, etc. Very comfortable and natural to use. I would've given it a 5-star review if not for the fact that only a week into using this, it developed a pronounced and exceptionally annoying squeak every time I spin the mouse wheel. I am considering returning this mouse and getting a different brand.Update: I wound up returning the mouse and Amazon sent me a replacement. I've had the new one for a few months now, and have not experienced the squeaky wheel problem with the new mouse. So I think I got a bad one the first time around. I've updated my rating to 4 stars (up from 3) because the new one works great, but beware that the quality is inconsistent with these.

  My original Apple mouse was dying, and my nephew condescending said, ""we need to get you a new mouse"", which was weird since he neither lives with me or buys anything, and I've been using Macs for longer than he's had motor control. But I bought a new Apple wireless mouse for something like $50 and enjoyed it for a few months. Then I realized that no matter what I did to the settings, I couldn't seem to control the tracking on it, and for things like Google Maps, it would zoom in and out uncontrollably. And the battery replacement reminders were driving me nuts.So I bought this $7 basic mouse with low expectations, but was immediately pleased as soon as I plugged it in (at both the mouse and the Mac's OS). It was recognized quickly and was in action within 30 seconds of leaving the box, has no batteries to replace, and it tracks based on my movement, not its own wacky interpretation of it.It was silly of me to hesitate to buy this because it's so cheap. Price, in this case, is no indication of functionality and I recommend it.

  This is a basic mouse that certainly fits my needs at a very low price. I got tired of changing batteries in wireless mouse's and don't mind the cord. I should have considered another reviewers comments about how you hold the mouse. I put thumb and ring finger/pinky on each side of mouse with two fingers, one on each button on top. Because the mouse is kinda cheap, the plastic section on top is thin and ever so slightly overhangs the bottom half of the mouse. This plastic edge cuts into my ring finger.It'll do but I will try to find a smoother housing next time.

  I tried wireless mice from various brands for over a year, yet all of the ones that were small enough and comfortable for my hand never lasted more than a few months. I was heavy into Overwatch when it first came out, and it really sucks when your mouse starts to crap out on you mid-match. I went through 4 wireless mice during that time. Frustrated with that, I decided to go with a simple wired mouse to use until I could research and hopefully find a more reliable wireless. Well, it has been two years now and I am still using this one. I even bought a back-up one just in case and still have yet to need to pull it out. Sure, the cord can be annoying sometimes and more buttons would be convenient for hotkey use, but this 3 button mouse has been enough for me and way more reliable than any of the wireless ones I have tried.

  My hands are small so the size is fine for me.  I got this because all of the Dell mice I had ended up with the same issue of registering single-clicks as double-clicks.  I've had the Amazon wireless mouse for years and it's been working great, so I figured I'd try to go with them for my new wired mouse.  It's been nice so far, except the clicker isn't as snappy as I would like.  I can't click as rapidly as some mice, because I have to lift my finger higher than my muscle memory takes it in order to actually register a release of the clicker.  Not that much of an issue except for certain computer games where precise timing is important.

  I ordered to this to replace my broken mouse. It's not anything crazy but it gets the job done. I use a desktop and some of the reviews said the cord might be a bit short for desktop use. When I opened the box I didn't think that the cord was any shorter than any of the other mouses I've owned in the past. Although, it seems like most of these basic mouses are made with a lapto user in mind. I've found the cord is just long enough to use the mouse comfortably. Granted, my computer is a full size tower and sits directly below my desk with the USB ports towards the top of the back panel of the case. If your desktop is not close to where your mouse lives you might have some issues with the length of the cord. The other thing I will say is that the mouse is not huge. I wouldn't say it's abnormally small but if you have larger hands and like to grip the mouse with your palm this probably is not the mouse for you. I'm female and have small to average size hands and the mouse fits comfortably in my hand but your mileage may vary.

Something I wish more expensive mice had.Overall this is a very quiet and effective mouse.

  This is a very small mouse and not comfortable to use for a man with average sized Viking hands.  I expected it to be similar to a standard Logitech, but is 70% of the size, by volume.  Everything else seems to click well, at least so far.  The resolution seems quite good for the price.  It's much better than many and I can stand to use it for CAD without feeling like the cursor is jumping around.  The wheel rolls without any annoying clicking noises or too much rubbery feeling resistance, which I great.  The middle button also seems to work fine.  I'd give this a 4.5 if it weren't for being tiny.

  The only real downside is its size. I have larger hands, so it is definitely a little small for my tastes, but this is about the average size of mouse that you'd find at schools, libraries, and offices. Not a huge deal, but if you want to use this mouse a lot and have bigger hands, consider a larger mouse. Of course, it comes down to you grip the thing too. I like a nice palm grip. The cord is also a little thin (you can see that from the photos) so don't be rough with it!I love Amazon Basics. I really do. This mouse has a nice solid feel. It's USB, it'll work with anything. The top is a matte finish which makes it a little bit more grippy. Buttons are solid. Mouse wheel includes the button press. The wheel spins easily, but not completely freely to avoid accidental scrolling. Slides just fine on a mousepad.Ergonomically, it doesn't seem designed one way or the other. It's symmetrical and I think it would feel just fine for left-handed people.If you want programmable buttons, back/forward buttons, or some crazy DPI and lights look elsewhere. This thing is a simple barebones mouse that gets the job done, and is a great value.

Practically adds no weight to my computer bag when traveling. It fits my hand well and I haven't experienced any fatigue using it.  I've used the mouse with my iMac, too, and it works very well (smooth tracking & scrolling).Overall, I'm very satisfied with this mouse.

  I purchased this mouse nearly five years ago in December 2014, looking for the cheapest option. I didn't expect it to last half as long as it has. It's still going strong, for the most part. I use it for my Macbook Pro setup that's connected to a monitor. Occasionally, I use it for slower-paced games such as Stardew Valley and Portal, but it's done alright with games like Left 4 Dead as well. I have small hands and the mouse is comfortable enough over extended periods of use.My only issue with the mouse, which can be expected given its age, is that the right button sometimes goes out. With a few forceful presses, it's back to normal. This may become annoying after a while, but at this price I wouldn't mind purchasing another.I can't speak for the quality of the mice being sold now (late-2019), but if they are anything like the one that I purchased almost five years ago, then I highly recommend giving it a try.

  This is a terrific basic mouse at a great price. I'm a Mac user and all their mice of late have been troublesome. The Mighty Mouse uses a ""touch sensor"" for the right click but if your finger isn't in just the right place it won't register. The scroll ball is great for left-right movement but it can't be removed so it can't be cleaned properly. It's also very large and to me fits oddly in the hand. The blue tooth mouse is also troublesome as the touch surface is the entire front end so accidentally stroking it will scroll the window. This mouse corrects all that with physical, tactile buttons and a rubber wheel with soft detents. It's also sized well. I have large hands but the smaller mouse feels easier to use. With good, basic design and a great price I feel like this is a no-brainer for anyone wanting competent functionality!

I don't have large hands, but I am a little arthritic, so the mouse doesn't fit comfortably in the curve of my palm.  I'm sure that if you don't have arthritis, and for anyone with smaller hands, this will work for you.The cord is shorter than my old mouse.  The cord is about 5 feet long and is just short of the limit of my cable management.It has a rubbery coating.  While I do like the tactile feeling of these coatings, they seem to rub off in high-use areas after a year of use.  Maybe this one will be different, though it wouldn't change my review rating based on my first complaint.

  Most people, including myself, don't need any more mouse than this. It works well; scrolls smoothly, clicks crisply, and the scroll wheel is just fine and not too loose. I like the fact that the surface has a satiny texture rather than a glossy finish, which makes it more 'grippy' and comfortable. I use this from browsing the internet to gaming. It's a huge improvement over the touch pad mouse on my laptop.Easy to set up and get started with. My only complaint is that, when I got it, there was a little nub of plastic left over from the molding on the right button, inside the crack between the two buttons above the scroll wheel. This would cause the buttons to bind up against one another. I simply took a razor blade and trimmed off the nub; a five second fix, and now it works 100%.Update July 2019: I got five years of good use out of this mouse before the left click became unreliable and unresponsive. Just bought another one. Can I get another five years of of this one? We'll see.

  It's hard to rise to poetic heights when writing a review of a mouse.  You can spend a goodly chunk of change for a Logitech or Apple mouse. They're nice to look at, but functionally not really any different. So you just want an optical mouse with left/right buttons and a wheel (which is also a button).  This one will do the job.  For some time, Amazon has provided a number of products that inhabit the 'add-on' world.  These are the things you buy when you purchase a camera (memory cards), a TV (cables) or a computer (mouse/keyboard).  These are typically the places where the unwary customer gets nailed with inflated prices.  To their credit, Amazon makes these inexpensive alternatives available. They work fine at a fraction of the price.  I have no complaints with this mouse, and I really can't tell it apart from others that cost twice as much.

  I bought this mouse over two weeks ago and I've been using it often ever since. The mouse has a matte feel to it and it connected well with my MacBook Air (It's the 2011 version). It has a long cord, but I never removed the tie and left it tied together since the shorter length is fine with me. I personally think that both the left and right mouse buttons aren't too loud in terms of clicking. The scroll wheel is subtle and I'd have to scroll a bit more to navigate up or down on a page. When I first used it, I noticed that when I would scroll with the mouse, the page would go the opposite direction. If I scrolled up, the page would go down and vice versa. That's one thing I noticed about the mouse in comparison to other mouses that I've used. Regardless, I've gotten used to it, but I would have to adjust to other mouses that scroll the opposite way.

",4.0,Kage.Maru,"Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2019","









  
  
    
  For the price, it was a great buy. I wouldn't recommend it for individuals who have bigger hands, though. I find that it is noticeably smaller than brand name mice from bigger manufacturers and can potentially be a little annoying for those who may be used to comparable products made by Dell, HP, etc. Otherwise, for moderate use, it works just fine.

  As I wrote in the headline, this is a basic corded mouse that works exactly as expected. I was looking for something that would point, scroll and click, and the mouse performs very well. As a bonus, it's smaller in size, making it a good fit for kids' hands, as well. if you have a large hand, I'd definitely recommend looking at other mice, since this is on the smaller side, and will likely make prolonged use uncomfortable.

  It started fine but three months later and the scroll wheel has gone buggy. You scroll and scroll and the screen crawls. I turned my scroll wheel sensitivity all the way up and it still stutters and skips. Not good. Other mice don't have this issue. Any device that you consider replacing after such a short period of time is a bad sign.

  After years of replacing batteries in my wireless mouse for a laptop that sits on a desk, I finally got a clue and ordered a wired mouse.  No more worries about batteries, no more worrying about turning the mouse off when I stopped working.  I love this mouse.  Seems adequate material wise.  The connecting wire is very long, can go around the laptop if necessary. I have not had it long so I cannot speak to durability, but I have probably saved its cost in batteries already.Gave it 5 stars overall, because I like it.  4 stars for materials because it is only adequate.  1 star for battery because that is NA.  3 stars for durability because I do not know yet so that is neutral.

  I have been using this little mouse all day. I bought it so that I could better work with a 3D modeling app. I have a mid-2012 MacBook Pro running Sierra. The interface was seamless, I just plugged it in and went to work.  It fits my hand comfortably and best of all, there are no batteries to deal with, nor a charging port the cord is a good length and no downloads are required.  I don't need an optical mouse since I will use this only when I find the trackpad a bit awkward. Plug and play, simple and cheap and gets the job done. I'm very pleased.

    A basic mouse that doesn't live up to  AmazonBasics name
  
",2.0,Health Guy,"Reviewed in the United States February 27, 2019","









  
  
    
  I wanted to like this wired mouse. It had a decent feel to it when I first plugged it in. Not a high dollar mouse by any means. But it felt pretty good in my hand. It was fairly quiet with the clicks and I liked the length and width of this mouse. Could have been a little bit bigger to be a perfect size for a wired mouse, but personal preference is taken into consideration here. I have large hands and cant use the smaller peripherals. The downfall with the AmazonBasics mouse for me has been this: I have purchased two of these. Neither one lasted very long at all. By not lasting long, I mean the first one lasted a few weeks and developed a noticeable skip of the cursor when using the mouse. No, it didn't happen right away but within 3 weeks I couldn't use it. The second mouse was a bigger disappointment as it lasted 2 weeks at most, then started doing the same thing. Skipping and acting as if it were having a seizure when scrolling over buttons or links on a page. It happened frequently. I use a wired mouse (company policy) daily. Sometimes up to 12 hours in a day or more when adding in personal time. I have to be able to count on my computer and peripherals -- keyboard, mouse and monitor for my job. This AmazonBasics wired mouse was just a disappointment for me. I wanted to like it, but I have NEVER owned any mouse, wired or wireless that didn't last for at least 1 year to 18 months minimum. Many have lasted 4-5 years for my systems. I saw a couple of other reviews saying the same thing about the mouse acting up during use and the cursor problem. I am very surprised the reviews are so high. Did I want a replacement or to try it again? No thanks. Third time is NOT the charm.

  WARNING DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE RESPIRATORY ISSUES!!To start my review this product was late and I am a prime member.  Though I was promised by an Amazon representative it will not happen again.  The product itself arrived in my mailbox.  It had a very strong smell of cologne, detergent, or perfume.  Once I opened it the smell became evident.  I got a mouse pad with it so I thought it may have been the mouse pad's chemical smell.  However, it surely was not.  The smell came from the mouse box, I opened the box and smelled the mouse and it was indeed the mouse that smelled of that substance.  I have asthma and whatever this substance was immediately triggered my asthma.  I am going to attempt to wash off the smell because I really need this mouse to finish some work.The mouse works fine as a mouse, no complaints there, all three buttons work.  It would be a five-star review if not for the hideous smell.  So if you don't mind those sorts of things and don't have a respiratory issue then you should be golden with this.

  This mouse is slightly smaller than my old one, which could be a pro or a con depending on your hand size and the intended use (i.e. for a laptop). The scroll wheel works smoothly and the buttons are easy to click. I started noticing odd behavior immediately after I installed the mouse. I would sometimes have to hold down the left button for a moment before it would properly left-click. Too light or too quick a touch would result in the equivalent of a right-click, something I've never seen before. The mouse driver and double-click speed settings are correct; I think this mouse is just defective. I ordered a Kensington Mouse-in-a-Box at the same time and that one works fine. It's slightly larger and has none of the strange left-clicking issues. I should have skipped the Amazon mouse and ordered two of the Kensingtons instead.

  This mouse is certainly on the small side, but has a nice texture to it, which provides decent grip and feel.  The click action is light, with minimal noise, requiring a light touch.HOWEVERThis mouse frequently loses its USB connection to the computer.  Windows doesn't have much info on the drivers for it, and its unstable as result.  Once a USB connection is lost, you have to restart your computer to get it to work again.  Simply unplugging it and plugging it back in does NOT work.  This is not a one time occurrence, this has happened three times in the past several days.

  This mouse was put into place to replace an aging Logitech mouse. It's fairly light, which can take some getting used to if your other mice have some heft to them. Some reviews recommend disassembling it and putting in some washers or weights for mass. I've gotten used to it pretty quickly.The biggest challenge I ran into is that the cord (1.5 meters) isn't quite long enough to reach to a desktop computer which isn't really close. If you have a computer UNDER the desk, or a desk with holes to direct cords, you may find that it can be a little taut sometimes. If this is the case, look for one with a 2 meter cord (Kensington's budget mouse # K72356US is good). If you're working with a laptop, all-in-one, or a computer on your desk, they you will probably WANT a shorter cord.

    Fantastic Inexpensive Option for Kids

  I have to say I kinda love this mouse.  It's extremely lightweight and cheap and perfect for my kids.Let me explain.  I LOVE Logitech. It's my personal mouse of choice. However, my hand-me-down mice to my tween and teen haven't held up well. The problem is consistently the USB end.  Not sure what my kids do with them, but they cease to work after a month.  Doesn't matter if the mice are used or new.  It's a death sentence to hand them to the kids.Enter the AMAZONBASICS cheapo mouse.  It's been 2 months and it's plugging away.  The bestest part about this whole arrangement is that if something does go wrong, it's inexpensive to fix.SUMMARYCouldn't be happier. This is not a mouse I would use because I like a mouse with some weight and one that is wireless, but it's a fantastic option for my tween and teen and I'd suggest it for younger children too.It works. There is no dongle to use.  And if it breaks it's cheap to replace.

  Very ergonomic and accurate compared to the large heavy palm mice.  These palm mice, ironically, are supposed to be more ergonomic, but in moving a mouse with your palm,  you are forced to use the large muscle groups in your arm and shoulder.  With a smaller and lighter mouse, you move the mouse with just your fingers, so the wrist and elbow ideally hardly move at all, reducing wrist strain.  Also, the smaller muscles in your hand are much more suitable to fine detailed work like moving a mouse to highlight a single character on the screen, or illustrating.  After all, you would not want to write calligraphy with a pen at the end of a pool ball just because it more ""ergonomic"", would you?  You would use a small and light stylus just large enough to grip comfortably, but no larger.

  I regularly use a 'gaming' mouse, because of the high DPI for the price. By comparison, this is a really, really low DPI mouse. With such a low dpi, you may notice that really small movements are not registered by the mouse, so beware of that. Due to the low DPI I would not suggest using this for gaming or digital art purposes, but this is a fantastic mouse for in case your main one breaks, or you want a wired solution for a laptop.Pros:-Small form factor makes this a really portable mouse, and it certainly feels robust enough to really throw around (and that this price, it is not like you would be too concerned with it breaking.)-High quality material: While this is a really light mouse, it does not have that 'cheap plastic' feel to it. The frame of the mouse does not creak or flex even when intentionally trying to crush it in the hand; Very solid design.Cons:-Small form factor: This mouse is really small. I have a bit of a large hand so having this mouse be so small starts to ache your hand a bit with prolonged use.-Short cord: This mouse has a pretty short cord, so using the rear IO ports is almost not an option if you have a full tower or have your computer more than about a foot or two away.-Small DPI: Really small mouse movements will not be recorded; Particularly noticeable when performing small circles with the mouse (The on-screen mouse will seem floaty and This problem will be more noticeable with a higher resolution screen.

  I received this mouse on Nov 28, 2014 and I have no complaints up to date. When I was looking to purchase a new mouse I was very focused on ordering a gaming mouse but honestly? Why? I used to play all of my PC games with a mini travel mouse and it worked just fine until It took a shat on me (Its okay, it was free). So I decided against spending tons of cash on something I didn't really need and instead bought this simple Amazon Basics mouse. I love it. Its actually quite nice and I find it to be very comfortable. I seriously recommend this mouse to any and all because its inexpensive but extremely effective. I've carried it with me in my laptop bag many times and accidentally caused the clicker panels to rise up but I simply pop them back in to place and they have never stopped working. ( Note: They are not flimsy, I just carry allot of stuff in my bag. )

",5.0,Eli Anderson,"Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2014","









  
  
    
  I bought this mouse for exclusive use with my work laptop, which I frequently port around with me in a Timbuk2 laptop messenger bag. I specifically went with a wired model for a couple of reasons. First, I've had bad luck with bluetooth mice frequently losing connectivity. My theory is that this is due to interference with other bluetooth devices - I'm almost always using my work laptop while also talking on my cellphone with a bluetooth headset. Whether or not that's the reason, the bluetooth mouse solution wasn't working for me. Second, my laptop JUST BARELY fits into the laptop sleeve in my messenger bag as-is, meaning it will not easily fit if I had to leave a USB receiver plugged in for a traditional wireless mouse. I figure if I need to plug & unplug the USB receiver easy time anyhow, then I might as well just use a wired mouse.This mouse is on the smaller side, but that's fine considering I'm using it with a mobile laptop on the go. Nice rubberized surface texture. Very light weight. Cord is approximately 4' long.

  That it lasted 9 months was amazing.  With kids banging about a and dog that likes to jump over the side to my lap having a mouse that will keep working even after being knocked down repeatedly is wonderful.Prior fancy (ie expense name brand) mice only lasted 4-6 months at most.  Very frustrating.  If this gives me another 9 months (as I expect), I'll be well satisfied.

  I picked up 5 of AmazonBasic 3 button USB wired mouse to replace some aging and dying HP mice.  They work great and fit your hand nicely.  The only thing I can say negatively is they are very light.  The mouse weights only 2 oz.  The HP mice we replaced weighted 3.5 oz.  Now you wouldn't think that 1.5 oz. would make that big of a difference, but it does.  It took us a few days of using the AmazonBasic mouse to get use to them being so light.  So allow yourself some time to get use to the mouse being very light weight.If you looking for a very good mouse and don't want to spend a whole lot of money, then pick one up.

  I like this mouse overall. It's a good size for my hands. Not too big. Simple, cheap, all in all a serviceable choice. I first ordered one in 2014 and it lasted several years. By 2017, it started to degrade, and it would, you know, like, register extra clicks, that sort of thing. I replaced it with another of the same, and again, similar performance. Now in 2020, the new one has finally begun to suffer the same issues. So I'd say it has a lifespan of about 3 years.It works. It's fine. Obviously it would have been better if it lasted longer, but I do feel I got reasonable value for the price, and I wouldn't feel bad about buying it again. I will say if you have larger hands, it might not be, like, ergonomic or whatever, as it is a small mouse. So, be aware of that.

  This mouse, for all points and purposes, does the job it's supposed to do: helping me click on things. It is smaller than I expected though which makes it a bit less comfortable to hold and I don't even have large hands. Also, the buttons click a bit too easily. I've found myself accidentally clicking on many occasions. I'm not sure if it's just the buttons or also due in part to the small size, but that is a bit irritating. Otherwise, it does everything a mouse should technically do so I can't give it too low of a score. For the price, it's fine, but I would recommend something else if you're not strapped for cash.

  The Good: Wonderful feel, texture, and very light movement of the cursor.  Easy to click right and left buttons with an slight audible snick sound.  It is smaller than my old Dell mouse that I can no longer purchase) but very comfortable!  It has a smooth scrolling wheel that I can barely feel (which is good!) and absolutely quiet (also good).The Bad:  Cord is way too short for my PC computer box because it is on the left side on the floor, and I am right handed. I need a 72"" inch long USB cord to connect it to the rear where the mouse was supposed to be connected so I could thread it behind the computer desk, the monitor, and have it reach comfortably on the right-hand side of the keyboard. I'm keeping it, because I had one USB slot on the front of my computer, that I liked to use for uploading my camera photos, GPS, etc.  Now I can't do that, so I'm going to have to find another wired mouse that will accommodate my previous set-up.  I prefer wired, not wireless.Summary:  Good for the money and quality, especially if you only have a cell phone.  Those with desktop P.C., lap tops or notebooks should find this fine.  If you have large hands, you will probably prefer something else.  My hands and fingers are on the short side (size 6 gloves) so I find it comfortable.

  Has excellent hand feel, is smooth and effective. Is compatible with ChromeBook, Windows 10 and Windows 7. The matte finish is pleasant to the touch and in appearance. Durability appears to be a problem, however. In my sample, the wheel developed a defect after about 6 weeks of moderate use in which scrolled content would ""bounce"" as though the detector inside the mouse had broken free or was flapping, result in a signal opposite to the intended movement immediately after using the wheel to scroll a page. At first I figured this must be a problem with software or cpu load (advertising, right?), but when it persisted across multiple machines and different operating systems, it was clear that the mouse wheel was the culprit. I'm buying another because it is inexpensive compared to the value, but I'm hoping that the first one was just an anomalous defect.

  This computer mouse is a good value for the money. I gave it four stars because the device is too short and too thin for a person with big hands. To use and analogy, a professional basketball player has much larger hands than a little old lady. They obviously wear different size gloves but they both use the same mouse. The size of the mouse is good for a diminutive woman but way too small for an adult man. Personally, my fingers extend way beyond the edge of the mouse. This mouse is essentially too short and too thin to be ergonomically comfortable for an adult male. Ideally, a computer mouse should be custom made to fit a person's hand, but this is not possible.

  I actually really loved this Amazon Mouse, at first! But, after 2 weeks of using it around 8-10 hours daily, it has failed! The scroll-wheel was very quiet, which has been nice, but this morning the wheel completely stopped functioning! It rotates, but does not scroll web pages any more.Here is what I liked about this mouse, before it failed:  It had a USB cord, which seems more difficult to find for a mouse these days. ( I hated dealing with batteries!)  It was a bit smaller so it fit my hand better. It was not too small like those ""portable"" tiny mice though.  The scroll-wheel was very quiet and smooth while scrolling.  The body had a nice feel and texture to it for better grip. It was not rubber, but not a glossy hard plastic either.Here is what I didn't like about the mouse.  The mouse scroll-wheel totally failed!  The scroll-wheel continually, accidentally engaged the ""third button"" feature because it had an extremely light touch, which was super annoying!  The cord was not as flexible as my other older Logitech mice.I am in the process of returning this mouse and I feel that this mouse is just too cheaply made to handle 8 to 10 hour daily usage that I need. I will look for a better quality mouse now.If you are a very light ""user"" and want a smaller, corded mouse, this one would probably work just fine. But, if it fails, be sure to initiate a return so that Amazon can learn that these mice really need to be a better quality.

  This mouse is very comfortable to hold (it has a kind of silky finish on it that feels soft), and it works fine (on my Windows 7 Pro computer) - just plug it in and go. It's cheap, too. Overall, an excellent value for the price.Details: It's a three-button mouse (well two buttons and the scroll wheel can be pressed to drag pages), and it's a laser mouse (no mouse ball... Do they even *make* mouse balls anymore? Oh golly, I hope not...). In other words, it's your standard USB corded mouse.

  My battery operated mouse finally ate it, and that is not the cheese I am referring to. The one thing that disappoints an old fart who is accustomed to buying something once and making it last forever is the planned obsolescence that forces us to constantly buy new - when it comes to modern technology, I have about half a dozen mice I can no longer use. This one, is sleek, charming, quiet, easy to operate on a variety of tabletops, responsive, quick, and I am not suffering the carpal tunnel pain because it does not sit so high. It is well designed and very efficient and a godsend since I am a MS veteran user, and even though the mousepad works, I actually find the positioning and the poise I must maintain to quickly navigate using the mousepad makes my hands, wrists and arms hurt. I also make many mistakes with the mousepad. Yeah, I am old now. I get to accommodate my age, and this mouse is the answer. Love, love, love this mouse.

    tiny travel mouse of good quality
  
",4.0,Vladimir Kornea,"Reviewed in the United States February 6, 2013","









  
  
    
  This mouse is tiny, unsuitable for daily use, presumably should be marketed as a travel mouse rather than a basic computer mouse.Its movement feels tight and responsive and smooth; the tension and the tactile feedback of the buttons and the wheel are excellent.But it is so tiny that it makes practically no contact with my palm. Its motion is controlled primarily by the two side fingers but this alone is imprecise and thus the button fingers get involved particularly when doing quick precise motions or vertical motions, and this means many accidental clicks (try minesweeper). It's also easy to accidentally click the mouse when moving one's hand back to it. It requires more attention and effort to use than my old Intellimouse Explorer 3.0 which is a large mouse with a curved design whose purpose I hadn't completely understood until just now. This Amazon mouse was not designed to be easily picked up or to be held without active effort, but other than that, it's great.

  You pay for what you get, which is a decent, no-frills mouse. The button action is soft and it's not the world's most high resolution mouse, but it more than suffices for office work. It also doesn't have any annoying, unnecessary LED lights.However, I'm not a fan of the rubberized top, which can wear away and get sticky over time and is kind of difficult to keep clean since it absorbs oils from your hand. In fact, one of these AmazonBasics mice that I have seems to have permanent sticky residue from the rubberized coating wearing away, and I'll probably have to discard it despite it otherwise working fine. Next time I'll probably buy a different cheap mouse without the coating!

  It took no more time to receive the AmazonBasics 3-Button USB Wired Mouse that it would have to make a special trip the store, and the price was lower than any other (even considering my wife's employee discount at Walmart).  Opened the packaged; plugged it in; it works flawlessly.Note:  I rather strongly prefer a wired USB mouse over a wireless one.  My mouse is almost constantly in motion and I'll run down a battery every day, so the one wireless mouse that I tried was a real nuisance.Most important to me:  It solves the problem I wanted to solve.  After several years of reliable operation, my old Logitech 3-button wired mouse had started developing odd symptoms.  It would double-click when I pressed the left button about 3 out of 4 times, and the problem was getting worse.  Copy and paste had become nearly impossible.  Dragging files from one spot to another was more likely to fail than succeed.  I searched the web about the problem.  A few sites bad-mouthed different versions of Windows.  Many offered to sell me their software that would surely solve the problem.  But most simply added up to:  ""Your mouse is broke.  Get a new one.""This mouse is a little lighter than the old Logitech mouse and has a slightly different shape, so it took about 20 minutes of mouse-intensive operations (3D modeling, actually) to retrain my brain.  The cord is a little stiffer, so I had to adjust the routing for the wire at the mouse end to make sure it had enough play to stay in place on my slippery mouse pad.  (It doesn't really need a mouse pad; I just like to protect the mouse from any accumulated grunge on my desktop.)

  Needed something to replace my aging Microsoft IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0. The old mouse still works great, but the rubberized surface is starting to get a bit tacky. So I wanted another one of those - except they don't make that particular style anymore (there is sort of a replacement, but not hearing good things about it). So I wanted just a inexpensive basic mouse to use while I shopped for something more to my liking. This AmazonBasic had the features I wanted - three-button, wired, & inexpensive - so I got one of these. It works. It's a bit smaller than I like, but it seems to be doing the job. The cord is plenty long enough and since I'm just doing basic computer stuff and not video gaming, it more than adequate for my needs. I'm satisfied with my purchase.

  Usually Amazon Basics products are good and priced reasonably, the problem with this mouse is that it has hair trigger buttons and it clicks just by placing your finger on it, sometimes it double clicks when you want a single click. This may cause severe problems by changes in your directories you didn't want occurring in a blink of an eye and you not knowing what happen. The horizontal movement is accurate.

  It can get very frustrating when your old mouse stops working, and sometimes it's hard to tell whether the problem is in the mouse or the computer. My old USB mouse began double-clicking when I only single-clicked, and it was a real pain in the neck. You'd click Next and the computer read it twice so you'd advance two screens and have to back up, stuff like that. I dug up another USB mouse to test, but it had the same issue, so I suspected it was a problem with my settings or the operating system. I checked and rechecked everything to no avail, slowed my mouse clicking rate, etc. — then ran across a piece of advice saying that often if you test using another older mouse, it is prone to the same problem, which has to do with a degraded switch ""bouncing."" So I chucked both old mice and ordered this one.Excellent price, performs as expected right out of the box, nothing to download — I mean, all that stuff that we expect nowadays. I don't like mice with additional buttons and stuff, so it's perfect. I did mark it just a 4 for portability because it would be a little bit more hassle to wind up the cord every time I take my laptop out, so I use wired mice strictly at my desk, and use a wireless when I go out.

  Works well for the price. Seems like it should hold up at least as well as my previous mouse that came with the computer. It also glides more smoothly than my last mouse and I don't think it's just because it's new. I think it's because the glide pads on the bottom have a better layout / design. It also has a matte finish so is starting to show wear where my fingers go. This is why I gave it 4 stars figuring if they used a glossy finish this would not happen so quickly. There's really no improvement over any other regular shaped mouse either so it's not a 5 star item.Update 092816: The mouse still works ok but the soft touch finish has been peeling off almost from the beginning. Once it's off I'll have a regular old hard plastic mouse versus one that looks like it got a sun burn and has it's skin peeling off. I probably would have just bought a logitec or other higher priced one if I know this would happen. It does look kind of gross but since it works it's silly to replace it for only that.Update 123016: The peeling is getting worse and it stopped working for a bit. I had an extra mouse though so used it for a bit instead of this one. Finally after being fed up with the amazon one not working I slammed it down a couple times and it decided to start working again. I guess a short got reconnected or something goofy like that.

  Mouse quality is decent. The material is very smooth and conveniently shaped for the hands to grasp. However the layout of the buttons is a bit flawed in design. The side click buttons are a bit too close to the center mouse wheel button, so there will occasionally be errant clicks when left-clicking or scrolling /clicking the mouse wheel. It is something to consider as you will have to adjust to the mouse's layout. Otherwise the product is good quality and cheap. Arrived on time in just 2 days.

  I am deployed to Afghanistan and needed a KVM setup as the unit I work for gave my stuff to the upper chain of command. That being said, I was looking for inexpensive and functional. The reviews for this mouse sounded like it would fit the part just fine for my mouse. It is just a simple two button + wheel mouse. The wheel also functions as the third button. The shape is slightly different from any other mouse that I have used. The bottom flairs out to the top and the middle, just behind the buttons is little wider than normal. I have found that if you use three fingers to operate the mouse leaving your middle finger on the wheel that this shape is actually nice as it my little finger and thumb rest nicely on that mid section.All in all I think this is a very functional & capable little mouse. It is inexpensive and does what it needs to do. Is this a good replacement or alternative for that Cyborg Rat 9, not by any means. That is not this mouse's intended purpose.

But then again I take great care of my things, and don't usually have problems in general.But Amazon has a great return policy and this comes with an industry standard warranty. So rest assure if anything goes wrong, Amazon has your back! Amazon didn't become a 900 billion dollar company by burning their customers who made them so big.A mouse is a mouse... Buy generic as cheap as possible, especially if it's branded by a company who stands by their product and most importantly appreciates and backs their customers.Happy computing, cheers!

  I have two laptops and I usually get tired of using the touch pad on the keyboard. I have missed using a mouse and hearing the scrolling and clicking like the good old days! Great price, great quality, and very easy installation. Just plug in the USB and it start using! I am using it as I write this. If you are trying to decide between this one and the wireless, remember that with this one you wont have to worry about connecting to Bluetooth and worrying if the connection is poor for some reason. This one is very straightforward, yet old fashioned and convenient. The wire isn't too long so you can wrap it around when you're all done!

  Here in COVID times, I wanted a 2nd mouse to reduce the amount of stuff I have to move when I take my laptop from the office basement to the main floor of my house. (I detest track pads, so a mouse is very desirable for me. Also, in my basement I have a multicomputer set up with an A/B switch for the mouse & keyboard which I'd prefer to keep assembled.) Thus I got one of these mice. Right away, I discovered it was not the most comfortable for my hand. However, I figured I could make do since I would be using it much less than the mouse I keep in the basement. Unfortunately the right mouse button now works only intermittently, in spite of a relatively small amount of use.

  Having purchased two of these mice, I cannot recommend them. On both occasions, the devices died after only a few months of use. I understand that this product does not represent the top of the price range, and comes with a limited lifespan somewhat implied, but even in the price range these do not do well. Similarly priced mice that I've had experience with (mostly Logitech) have lasted years. I also find the Amazon mouse to be a bit smaller than I'd like, and it's buttons seem a little too light, giving it a tendency to twitch-click. Someone else might like those aspects  of the mouse, but the concerns of durability will apply to most users.

",3.0,John B. Richardson,"Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2018","









  
  
    
  Good basic mouse, but very low profile.Generally speaking there are two kinds of mouse users:  clawers and palmers.  Clawers grasp the body of the mouse with their fingers and the palm is usually kept off the mouse body or in very light contact.  Palmers rest the palm of their hand on the mouse body and move the mouse using their palm as opposed to their fingers.Clawers usually like a low body, light mouse- which this one is.  Palmers usually like a higher profile, heavier mouse.This mouse is suited more to clawers than palmers.  It's very light and low profile.  No bells or whistles, two buttons and a clickable scroll wheel.Works fine.  Just not what I'd like ergonomically.  On the other hand, it's for my work laptop and I'm not going to spend for a good mouse for that!!

  Price, price, price. This mouse beats every other mouse, dollar for dollar.I used to buy the run of the mill Logitech mouse, and would break 2-3 of them every year. They were easy and cheap to replace, so whatever. This mouse actually feels nicer. It's a slightly softer feeling plastic, and a little smaller than the Logitech. This fits in my hand a little better than the Logitech as a result.These are actually even less expensive than the Logitechs, too. I bought three of these for the price of two Logitech devices. So far, I haven't actually used the two backups. I purchased these in August 2014.EDIT February 2015: I just wanted to add that these things are very durable too. The way my desk is set up, the wire from this mouse sometimes ends up by my feet, and when I get up to walk away, I would kick the wire and send the mouse careening to the hardwood floor. I literally do this multiple times per day. The mouse still has not broken. I ended up giving away the 3rd mouse, because I'm content with having just two of these.EDIT October 2015: Still using my original mouse. Haven't even opened the packaging on the backup.EDIT May 2016: I got some adorable pet rats several months ago. The Amazon Basics mouse is one of their favorite foods! I've had to replace two of these this year when my ratties got a little carried away with them! I try not to let them near my desk anymore!

  Garbage. I usually love Amazon basic items and could probably find a useful item to purchase every day and probably love most of them. However, this mouse is not one of those items. The middle scroll/button about half the time would recognize a click when I would click the left mouse button. I'd be skimming a webpage then the click activated and my scrolling screeched to a crawl. My last mouse cost me 30 bucks and lasted many many years. Don't try to save a buck, just spend a few more and get something that's better quality.

",2.0,Wired365,"Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2018","









  
  
    
  There are very few positives to this mouse. One is the price, its extremely cheap for a mouse to just have around when you need it, I wouldn't use this as a daily driver as I'm not a huge fan of the shape. The second is that it does work as a mouse, kind of.This mouse, in my opinion, is very poorly designed. My major issue with it is that the laser on the bottom is pointed sideways and casts it light down and to the left. Now if you are a right handed mouse user and you are working on a surface with any kind of reflectivity now matter how small every time you pick the mouse up to adjust it's position the laser light will bounce and catch you in the corner of the eye. It drives me crazy. To make matters worse my mouse likes to double click sometimes when I only click once or click and hold without releasing. I can only guess that I got a bad left mouse button but who knows.I would not recommend this to anyone with a mildly reflective desk surface that is a right handed mouse user.

  Decent mouse with a functional design flaw. This mouse does its' job and for the price, it's actually a pretty good deal. The biggest issue I have with this mouse is that when I right click, the right click button gets stuck half the time. The reason it gets stuck is not because of the mouse itself but because of the design.Like most right-handed people, I hold the mouse with my thumb on the left side of the mouse and my middle finger on the right side. The problem is that my middle finger touches the side of right click button and when i do click it with my index finger it gets stuck.They could fix the design by doing one of these things:-Make the buttons shorter so the middle finger has enough room to hold the right side of the mouse without touching the right click button. Currently it's almost 2 inches vertically. They could probably shorten it to just a little over 1 inch.-Make the mouse bigger. I'm starting to think this mouse was meant for 10 year olds or anyone with small hands. My hands are medium sized and I think this is way too small.

  I started using Macs in 1982 when the System was still on a floppy, so I've had many - both at work and at home.  Since I was down to my last functioning USB mouse, I decided to get this one so I would have a spare.  Checked to make sure it worked - and it definitely does just fine with Mac OS Catalina.  But it is already wearing a sore spot on my finger.  The edges are sharp, not curved, and the seam where the right button meets the edge and the back part of the mouse is rough.  The inside of my ring finger literally catches on it.  So, this mouse is fine if you need one that is cheap and works, but ergonomically it really sucks.

  I like a wired mouse because I don't want to be hassled buying and stockpiling expensive batteries ( or possible losing my mouse ) - my husband's Mac mouse requires batteries about 10 times a year.  On the other hand, with a wired mouse, the cord takes us space and can tug at it causing it to skew in a direction you don't wish it to go in.  You decide which issues you want to deal with.This mouse is certainly cheap enough to give it a try.  The buttons are responsive and the size is perfect to fit within your hand with the buttons just beneath your fingers - maybe a little too responsive as I often right-clck when I don't intend to.  I expect that I will learn to avoid this over time.  The tracking wheel is not as responsive but works well enough.  One feature that I miss from my old $5 three-button-mouse that only lasted a couple of years is a retractable cord that limited the cord clutter and the tendency for the cord to pull at the mouse and cause it to skew from the intended direction (are you listening, Amazon?).  For $7 delivered to you door, this mouse is a very good value.I want to add that, after finding the trigger happy right click button a problem, I rolled a tiny piece of masking tape between the slot that separated the top and the bottom on the right and the problem was solved.  Now I have to press a bit harder to use that function.

  I brought this mouse (Late October 2014) originally because I brought a cheap mouse from ebay that only lasted me about a week before it started double clicking. I did some research and found out that when your mouse randomly double clicks it's a sign that you should change your mouse. So after surfing and gaming it finally started to double click yesterday. But it lasted a lot longer than one from ebay. Surprisingly enough my compaq mouse (which isn't usb nor wireless aka the mouse slot on older pc's) lasted for several years until it couldn't click no more. Now, I don't know what's happening to the quality of mouses nowadays, they are not what they used to be. It still works but it double clicks, which is annoying. I might buy another mouse (instead of this one) since i'm still on the hunt for a mouse that can last several years without breaking the bank. It works and it's smooth but buyer beware because results (how long it lasts) may vary.Update (9/23/15): You can make the mouse last longer by switching the left and right buttons.

  At first it seemed like a good basic mouse.  I needed one because my laptp's trackpad doesn't work well anymore.  But after a couple of days, the middle part when I need to use to move up and down started to squeak.  At first I tried to ignore it but it was getting really bad and loud.  It was so stressfu.  I thought I could just try to live with it, but not pssoible.  Will return. Sadly.

    Basic Low Cost Laser Mouse for cheapsters replacing their antiquated ball mouse :O
  
",4.0,Jedz,"Reviewed in the United States November 8, 2017","









  
  
    
  This is a basic laser mouse with 3 buttons. Absolutely nothing fancy here. It is simply a low cost replacement/upgrade for the few who are still using ball mouses. 1-star deducted for the short cable length as the prior ball mouse's cable was able to reach the computer USB port without needing a USB extender, this one did not, forcing me to purchase a USB connector. If your mouse is going to be located more then 4-5 feet away from your computer's USB port, find another mouse with a longer cable. The difference in price will be less than the cost of an extender.

  Functionally, the mouse works well and precise. But the other reviewers were right, the mouse is too small to be comfortable, and the buttons are too sensitive so that I can't rest my fingers on them and often click them inadvertently. I managed to wedge a tiny piece of foam underneath, that made it better. And hopefully I get used to the small size. Would not recommend.

  We come from a very technical house hold, and we are a house of gamers.  We were firmly in the razor camp until we had a few of those go dead before their time, for their cost.  We purchased a few of these as spares and fill ins, and a few of the computers still have them attached.  These really can not be beat for the money.  You plug it in, it works, no finicky software needed.  They have a very nice no slip texture to them, but so far they really seem to stay pretty clean as well, no gunk and sweat build up.  The cord length is nice, I can not see how anyone could beat the product for the price that its offered for here.  No its not a 5000dpi mouse, but really after years and years of gaming, ive never set mine that high anyway.  If you need an economical mouse, even for a part time fill in, this one is the mouse to get.  You will not be disappointed.

  We've been living with a couple of $12 drugstore mice for a while. That, in retrospect, sucked.Finally in frustration, I searched for the cheapest USB mouse on Amazon.com. Lo and behold, it's an Amazon Basics mouse. I've had great experiences with Amazon Basics in the past, so we ordered two of them.They did not disappoint. Optical tracking is so, so, so much better and smoother than the drugstore mice that it isn't even funny. They're far more ergonomic as well, with a nicer surface finish and more tactile feedback in the clicks. They look great as well—simple, black, elegant.For just a few bucks, this is a mouse that could be a primary, everyday, heavy-use mouse for 99.5% of the population and do the job perfectly.

  When my Logitech Mouse's scroll wheel bit the dust, I knew it was time to get a replacement; problem was, since I'm on a fixed income, and it was near the end of the month, there wasn't much money available for a good replacement.  So, I looked here on Amazon, and found a low cost replacement- which, as it turns out, was just as well, because the Amazon Basics mouse works just as well as the notably more expensive Logitech mouse did.The only flaw is, the mouse is a bit small, but that's sort of subjective, given that not everyone has the same sized hand.  Nonetheless, this mouse is a bit small for my hand.In any case, it's a pretty good, basic wired mouse.

  The clicking is positive but very quiet.

I like this best because it works great (using it with a Mac Mini, because I've gotten tired of some hiccups with Mac--including this new mini, with bluetooth. One downside on this Amazon Basic mouse. the edges where your fingers set on the top of the sides is not as well shaped as other mice, so it's a little less comfortable to me.

  I have owned several of these. They work very well BUT after about 2 years the rubberized non-slip coating (on top surfaces of the mouse, where your hand rests) starts to degrade into a sticky crumbly mess. At that point you have to use alcohol and your fingernails to peel and scrub off the coating (takes almost an hour) leaving the plain plastic underlying surface, and it's very hard to get all of that crud off. Or you can throw the mouse away and get a new one - which is OK considering the price. The rubberized coating is apparently there to make the mouse feel nice under your fingers, but it would have been better to leave it off to begin with.

On a whim and because of the great reviews I read on it, I decided to give it a try.I've only owned it for a month but I love it.  The size is perfect.  It's larger than most budget mice (I believe there's a customer photo showing a comparison) but not grotesquely.The click of the buttons is solid and it feels well built.The wheel is smooth with a gentle click as you scroll unlike my Microsoft mouse.  You could most likely hear me scroll through webpages down the hall of my apartment building.The 1000 dpi is perfect for me as well.  800 dpi has always seemed to slow therefore I've had to fiddle with the mouse settings to make it ""feel"" quicker.One tiny thing that thrilled me when I noticed it.  Most mice some with four slick rubber/plastic feet or nubs on the bottom to make the mousing smooth.  I ALWAYS end up sheering one or both of those things off.  With this mouse the rear nubs (where your palm would sit) are indeed one single nubby.  I feel I'll be less likely to sheer this off.  Nothings worse than a three-legged mouse!We shall see how long this little guy lasts.  My Microsoft Mouse lasted almost a year.

  It's a decent, disposable, low-cost USB mouse. As a SW engineer, I use mine 10-12 hrs a day, 5-6 days a week. These usually last 12-14 months before I have to replace one. The wires are what causes them to die ... I'm guessing they eventually break internally from stress, or become disconnected inside the mouse. The latest one died on me yesterday. I bought it in Jan 2018. Not worth my time to pull it apart and try to fix it. Can't complain though, for what little they cost anyhow . Wished they would last longer. I usually buy 2-3 at a time to make sure I always have a spare.  As long as you buy one knowing it's not going to be a long-term relationship, you will not be disappointed.

Where before I would have to use my entire mousepad and sometimes pick the mouse up and move it over to cross the entire page; with this one, I move it just a little and the cursor whips to exactly where I wanted it.  No picking up needed.  It's a comfortable shape and I really like that it has a matte type finish on it.

  It's too small of an office mouse but it's good enough for airplanes.In the first picture, you can see that the cord length is a nice amount for people that don't have a USB port directly next to them. It's not ridiculously long, but these days cases and keyboards have multiple USB ports so if you plan to use this for gaming, it's not going to be a problem if you have small hands, otherwise normal/big hands will have trouble with the grip. I wouldn't personally use this for FPS or high-DPI gaming because it's not as professional, high-DPI, or robust with features as normal gaming mouses. It's best for airplane business work, gaming is a tougher feat.As an office mouse the lack of annoying features and general simplicity is what stands out. When I do school work or other things that are non-gaming related I can't have large amounts of buttons placed all over the mouse. You plug it in, you left click, right click, middle mouse button click, or scroll. It's that simple.The mouse wheel is one of the first things I tested out and it gave a bit of resistance, which is exactly what I want with a non-gaming mouse. When it comes to office work, the sensitivity of the scroll wheel is important because on a lot of gaming mouses if you hold down the scroll wheel and drag the mouse down it can go from page 1 to page 500 in a millisecond.

I'm just thrilled that I don't have to buy batteries any more or worry about leaving my wireless mouse on by mistake.This mouse is slightly smaller in size than other brands. Also, it's shorter in center where my palm rests than my Microsoft wireless mouse, so I have to lower and close my hand a little bit more to rest my palm on it.

The buttons don't need to be depressed very far, allowing for quick clicks.  Overall, this is a really great buy for a mouse to use in day to day computing.  Good quality for a low price.

  I like a corded mouse when I use my laptop. I find that i have more control than when i use the trackball or finger-pad on the laptop so I always have a corded mouse available - at work, at home, in my briefcase.For some reason my regular mouse (Dell) started acting up - it would cause the pointer to skip and when I right-clicked on an image it would skip all around the screen. Annoying! So I needed a new corded mouse.I found this Amazon one and honestly bought it because of the price - super inexpensive. I wasn't expecting much but when it arrived I started using it and was very pleased at how precise and easy to use it was! I was probably using the old broken one for so long that I had forgotten how nice it was to have one that worked correctly! Anyway, very happy with the purchase and will get another should the case arise.

    Mouse Needs Update of Substantial Connection Between Cord and USB Plug

  I have bought approx 4 of these.  I respect Amazon Basic's devices.  But these mice are not well protected where the cord meets the USB.  That flimsy connection causes deterioration and failure after a few months.  I wish I could say buy but I say do not buy until design is more substantial.

  Most uncomfortable computer mouse I've ever used. It's cheap, so you expect it to be cheap, but you also expect it to be designed to fit the human hand. Apparently one of the corners cut was any consideration for the customer being able to hold the mouse without straining their hand because of how incredibly small it is and how low of a silhouette it has. This is just painful to use for any length of time. Not recommended. Buy something else.On top of that, the cord is incredibly short, so it's recommended only if you're using it for a laptop or your desktop tower is right next to you. The plastic feels incredibly cheap to touch. Those are flaws that are forgivable for the sake of a lower price. The thing being so small it immediately causes pain when you use it is not. Avoid, avoid, avoid.

  According to another review there's two kinds of mouse users - clawers and palmers. I'm a clawer - I use my thumb, ring finger, and pinkie to move the mouse around, rather than resting my palm on it and pushing with my whole forearm. After burning through a few Wal*Mart mice I decided to take advantage of Amazon Prime's free shipping and ordered several of these to keep on hand to replace failed mice - stuck 'em in a cabinet and promptly forgot about them. But now that I have to work at home during the coronavirus situation, and not wanting to screw up the travel mouse I keep in my laptop case, I remembered I had these, hauled one out of the cabinet and plugged it in. What can I say? I plug it in, the light comes on, I move my hand, the mouse cursor moves. Woo. Wild times? Probably NOT! But, it's functional, does the job, and doesn't look hideous or feel like I'm holding a dead rodent or something. IT'S A MOUSE! GET OVER IT!!! :-)

    Get the Logitech M100 instead
  
",2.0,Simon,"Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2015","









  
  
    
  There is one major reason why after using the Amazon Basics mouse that makes me still think that the Logitech M100 is still the best budget mouse out there and that is due to the size. This Amazon mouse is just too small and that's saying something as I have small hands myself. If the M100 is so good, why did I try this one? Simple. I love Amazon and for $6.99, it wasn't that big of an investment/risk.Pros:- It's cheap and from Amazon (Amazon fanboys will agree with me)- Love the matte black surface of the mouse- Doesn't feel like you paid less than $10 for it- Good DPICons:- Really small, making it more ideal for fingertip/claw grip mouse users (palm grip people stay away)- Technically should weigh less than the M100 but actually feels a tad bit heavier- Mouse is very slim, making it feel even smaller due to your inside palm not having a place to rest (another reason why palm grip users need to stay away)Neutral:- Mouse scrolling is very silent. I personally prefer the notchy, clicky/clacky scroll wheel like the M100.I personally think this mouse is a bargain if you order in bulk for school or lab uses. However, I would find something else for everyday usage unless you have a really, really tiny hand. If you're looking for a lightweight yet cheap everyday mouse, you must take a look at the Logitech M100. I swear by it and prefer it over the much more expensive mouses I've tried.

  After owning this item for the past several months, I must say, this mouse works as perfectly as it did since the day I bought it!  The scrolling is smooth, the wheel in the middle and buttons have never once became stuck, the length of the cord is perfect, it has 1,000 DPI so the pointer on the screen never lags, it's compatible with my Windows 7 64-bit OS (now Windows 10 64-bit), and, due to the material it is made out of, there is absolutely no sign of wear or dirt.  With older mice, the buttons would have a tendency of forming dirt and the daily use would become noticeable.I would say the only downfall is that it's a wee bit smaller than your standard mouse.  If you have huge hands or suffer from carpel tunnel, then you should probably look elsewhere.  Otherwise, I couldn't be more happier!Update (20 JAN 2017):  Well, as it turns out, after 1 year and 10 months of normal use, the left mouse button is no longer able to double-click after the first few attempts.Thinking this was a computer-related problem, I swapped it out with an older Logitech mouse that I had purchased in 2005 (!!!).  To my surprise, it still works like a charm.I wish Amazon would stand behind their products.  There's no reason why a 12 year old mouse should outperform a recent, more modern-day version from close to 2 years ago.

",2.0,M.,"Reviewed in the United States April 14, 2017","









  
  
    
  Original review:This mouse is cheap...in both senses of the word.There's nothing wrong with it, mind you. I tend to think simpler is better in terms of mice, so I wasn't out to get anything fancy, and this definitely fits the bill. It's slightly smaller than my last one, both in length and thickness, but it's not as little as those awful miniature ones. And it works exactly like it ought to.It is, however, super chintzy. It doesn't have nearly the heft or sturdiness of my last mouse; it feels like I could crush it just by squeezing too hard. If I hadn't somehow busted the scroll wheel in my last (HP brand corded) mouse, there's no question that I'd prefer to keep using the old one. If I'd known just how cheap this one felt before buying it, I might have paid a few extra bucks for another HP one.But I didn't, and as I said, there's nothing wrong with this mouse. It works fine, and I'll keep it and use it. If you don't mind having an extra light weight mouse, then definitely get this -- you can't beat the price. If you would prefer something a bit more substantial, though, keep looking.EDIT: OK, so I'm dropping my rating from 4 stars to 2. After only a day or so of use, the right mouse button has started to stick. As in, I press it down, and it doesn't come back up...and in the couple days since, it's already gone from an occasional irritation to nearly every time I click it. I can manually pull the button back up, but good grief. I haven't dropped the mouse, or spilled anything on it, or even used it with dirty hands, so there's absolutely no excuse for this. Cheap, indeed.

  I use the Amazon Basics 3-Button Mouse for regular computing needs, either with an Amazon Basics keyboard or with another keyboard. I've used the Amazon Basics Mouse for many years, I generally replace my mouse every 12-18 months, and the Amazon Basics Mouse does what I need a basic mouse to do on a budget.Why not 5 stars? Well, like any wired electronic appliance you're going to use on a regular basis, the cord likes to get tangled up with all the other cords of other things, and if the cord was just a foot longer it wouldn't need to be untangled as often (or that's how it feels), other than that it's just a basic budget mouse, nothing special except for the price, but that's the point.I do use it for gaming, but most of the games I play aren't as mouse-performance heavy as many games where people buy a specific 'gaming mouse' for. I occasionally notice a bit of latency in a game from when I click to when the click ""takes"", but it's not enough to really effect the kinds of games that I play.In terms of comfort, I hold it with my thumb and pink of my right hand on either side, holding the mouse, then my middle finger on the mouse wheel, my right pointer finger on the left click button, and my right ring finger on the right click button. It's comfortable enough, I use it quite a bit, but it's not a very comfortable mouse for other people that I've sometimes lent the computer, they have a different mouse posture and find it to be uncomfortable for periods longer than about 30-45 minutes.

  I used this mouse for some months, perhaps eight, then it failed. It was a spare, so it failed after the 12-month return period. The wire is thinner than most other mouses that I've had and right where it enters the body of the mouse developed a problem. If I pushed the wire directly into the body, the mouse would work for a while. However, it soon got flaky again.The Fix: There were no visible screws or other fasteners that hold it together, but I finally found the single screw on the bottom under the label. That allowed me to open the box. Inside is a well-designed layout, with a route for the wire designed to remove stress and even a ferrite toroid to impede RFI. However, that first 90-degree turn was where the problem was. I proved it possible to strip, join, solder, and insulate the wires to repair, but only someone with the patience of Job and the wisdom of Neville Chamberlain should attempt on this inexpensive, disposable mouse.

  Great price for a simple, basic mouse that works great.  I am one of the people who curve their hand up over the mouse rather than laying it flat on the mouse.  I find the mouse very comfortable, wheel turns smoothly, responds great.  My kids also use my computer, so the mouse gets a lot of not-so-gentle use.  It still works like it did on day one.  Very, very pleased;

  So happy to be rid of having to constantly replace batteries! Also, my previous two would frequently loose their signal ( the cursor would disappear). Had to turn them off and then on again to get the cursor back. I love this Mouse! If the computer is on the mouse is on! I have a large screen desktop and have plenty of USB ports. I am only sorry that it took me so long to turn this corner. The size is fine: not smaller than others I have used. (I have average size hands.)

",5.0,Abraham S.,"Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought one of these mice (mouses?) 5.5 years ago to go with my new laptop.  I work on my computer all day and have spent untold hours using and abusing it every day for 5.5 years.  I'm talking at least 6-8 hours a day - sometimes more - 5 to 7 days a week for 5.5 years.It still works.After about 4.5 years of this constant, endless, never-ceasing abuse, the mouse-wheel got finicky when it was humid.  At about 5 years of constant abuse the left click button started occasionally needing extra force.It still works though.For the price, I'm beyond pleased.  A normal user could probably get a decade (or more) of reliable use out of it.  I'm buying a new one to replace the old one because lately it'll occasionally release when I click and hold, even with a harder left click.  That's it's biggest problem after 5.5 years.What a trooper. :)

    Excellent Wired Mouse - Updated 2 Sep 19

  Update — my mouse finally failed after four years. For the price, this was an adequate life span. Since I was satisfied with the this mouse, I have order another.When my old mouse died, I went looking for another mouse. I wanted a USB mouse. This mouse met all of my requirements, so I searched the 1 star comments to see if there were any show-stoppers hidden there. There were the usual, it didn't work upon receipt or broke after a short use. After five weeks, there have not been any reliability issues. The only other comment was that it was small. I looked at the dimensions, and it did not look small and appeared to be the same size as my current mouse. I believe that these reviewers were use to the large ergonomic mice. As stated before, the mouse work immediately, and it size fits my hand well. If you are looking for an inexpensive, wired mouse, that isn't the size of a full-sized car, this mouse is for you.

    Really Nice, Inexpensive Wired Mouse
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2018","









  
  
    
  I do a fair amount of computer building, and there are many times I need a wired mouse for a short time during installation. This Amazon Basics mouse fits the bill beautifully. It is very reasonably priced, and works well, too. So good, in fact, that I pull it out from time to time to use it on my laptop when I am doing something that is easier with a mouse. Sure, I have more expensive mice that I use, but this one really fits the ""hole"" in that collection, and I can easily recommend it for builders and for regular users. Build quality seems very good. Nice touch: not only does it work well with nice clicking action, but it is physically light, so you can carry it around with ease, and using it doesn't wear you down like other mice can, due to their weight. Five stars for price, five stars for functionality.

  Not the most portable due to the cord. However, I enjoy that it is a corded USB mouse, no more changing batteries or looking for the separate uncorded USB like my previous ones. This is such a great value and what I need for my laptop to select, copy, and paste my online assignments. Copy information for works cited pages, and just great when shopping online and doing my lesson plans. This item was better than expected for the price. Thanks Amazon!

  I am really impressed with this mouse.  I am only reviewing within the parameters of point and click, not gaming.  I didn't expect much more than a traditional mouse. I like the texture of the surface, it's not smooth and slick, but smooth and velvety.  Your fingers don't glide off the buttons, they stay in place without being sticky.  I can imagine it would make for some fierce WoW action or spamming.  I'm  a homeschooling mom of 3 kids, when the other two need a mouse, this is the one that will be bought for them.  It tracks wonderfully too, no problems there.  It would be great for a desktop as the cord is long enough to be plugged into one side of a chromebook and brought around the other side with lots to spare.  We simply bind the extra length with a velcro tie.

  This was a spare so I just started using it. Noticed that browser tabs were occasionally disappearing and pages randomly being opened magically. Realized that it was the scroll wheel cooking off.

    Many accidental clicks
  
",4.0,Eddie Kang,"Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2018","









  
  
    
  I use the mouse right-handed with my index on the left button and middle finger on the right. I feel there is a mild amount of lateral movement of the left button that when I press, it is enough to cause friction onto the right button and cause an accidental click.I also have frequent accidental clicks of the right button when I am gliding around the mouse. I'm not sure if the resting weight of my middle finger is a bit too much or the resistance of the button is too little, but regardless, the result is less than satisfactory.With that said, I feel my hand has adjusted accordingly in the weeks since I started using the mouse as I've had less mis-clicks. Also, you can't beat this price.4/5

  Not happy! For $6.99 AmazonBasics mouse not working within 40 days of purchase, I had to speak with TWO representatives and ONE supervisor (phone call was more than 22 minutes) and all I get is unfriendly, insincere customer service! for a product WAS MANUFACTURED by Amazon and is under Amazon's warranty! An online form should be available for quick replacement for AmazonBasics products, instead of calling Amazon to speak with clueless unfriendly or hand-tied employees(one of them told me to contact the manufacturer lol) ! What a hassle! Good news: After the hassle, you need print label and ship it back to them (they insist on getting the defective $6.99 mouse back) (enjoy the 20 minutes wasted lunchtime drive to UPS store).

  Almost didn't buy this after reading the reviews, but for the cheap price I thought I'd try it.  It's not that much smaller than my old mouse so after a few hours of use I didn't even notice the smaller size.  Yeah, there is a louder clicking noise, but again after a few days I rarely notice it (besides there's usually background noise in my house).  Plugged it in and it's been working great ever since.  Could be I love it so much because I put up with my failing mouse way longer than I should.  Can't beat the price and so far I love it!

  We've purchased two of these so far, and will soon be purchasing another. My youngest son had a very hard time using the magic mouse on my imac to play Minecraft, so we purchased the AmazonBasics mouse for him to use instead. My older son had been using one on his computer for a year or so, and it worked great. Now, however, my husband keeps stealing the one connected to my imac to use on his laptop (I think we have too many computers), so my youngest son gets upset every time he goes to play Minecraft and he's left with only the magic mouse. So I think we're going to become a three AmazonBasics mouse family very soon. Which, at that price, is very hard to complain about.

  I work at a library and we've just gotten several new computers for staff use.  Along with the larger office model, we also have six laptops with the usual ""touch pad"".  I really hate these.  They're so ... well, touchy.  As a result - since it turned out I wasn't alone - my boss bought an AmaznBasics 3-button USB Wired Mouse.  I have small hands and usually have difficulty w/ a larger mouse.  This is a perfect size for me, and I love the textured surface.  I have a new laptop at home and have been struggling w/ the touch pad, so I bought one of these for myself.  I couldn't be more pleased.  I've used both cheaper and more expensive models in the past, but this is the most comfortable, responsive and quietest of them all.  If you are considering this purchase, you will not be disappointed.  This is a great little mouse, and the price is pretty sweet, too!

  Overall I'm satisfied with the quality for the cost but there are some slight problems with it. First off its a small mouse. Not as small as a notebook mouse, but smaller than the Logitech mouse I'm use to using. I don't think this is a really big deal.What is more of a big deal is 8 months after I started using it the mouse wheel acts strange. It often rolls backward on the screen after I use the wheel even when the physical wheel is not moving. Also when I use it to scroll a lot it can lock up. Clicking the wheel like a button once to set it into a different mode and once more to go back to normal mode seems to fix this but its annoying. I would blame Chrome for this but I never had a similar issue with other mice I've used., so I really think its the cheap amazon basics mouse.I think for my next mouse I'll pay a bit more for something physically larger and technologically more reliable. But I'm not going to stop using this cheap mouse. Its definitely worth what I paid for.  This would actually be really good for children considering the size and price.

  Well after it took almost a week and a half for Amazon to send me a mouse that that i paid for 1 day shipping for ( and 2 reorders), the mouse finally came. Im disappointed. As this mouse is very very small. Its only useful for little kids or someone with very small hands. Its not really ideal for adult computer use. Wasted all that time for nothing! Wish i could get a refund but i dont want to know the hassle thats going to take. Ill give it to my daughter or nieces for Christmas with their laptop or something. Only good qualities is that it feels durable. DPI not perfect. but decent. Outside of that,.......just order a different mouse.

  I bought the AmazonBasics keyboard and this mouse as well because I really loved the keyboard. I also had to replace the boyfriend's mouse because the old one was slow, I had to move the pointer in one direction over and over to finally get it to where I wanted it and usually had to click several times to get it to respond. This one, however, has no such problems. Super responsive, I barely have to move it to get it to where I want. Computer recognized it immediately when I plugged it in so no need to set anything up. Cord is super long but great quality so it stretches to the tower that's on a nearby bookcase (we don't have it next to the monitor) without pulling the mouse with it. The material is great quality, no fraying or exposed wires yet at the usb end and my boyfriend tends to abuse his technology. The roller rolls easily and smoothly and the size is great for both my hand and his (his hand is much bigger, he's a man after all). Plus, you really can't beat the price! I will be buying another when this mouse dies (however long that is, still holding strong after all this time!).

One neat thing is that because of the cord, if the mouse gets separated from the laptop, I can always find it easily.

  Easy to connect and easy to use.  I am hard on wired mice. I get tangled in them, get them tangled inside the workings of the recliner, kick/jerk them out of their USB port, etc, and the cord's pay the price.  So I had to have a new one. I tried two different mice (one wired and one wireless) before I got this little beauty.  The cheap wired mouse was hard to click.  Took real effort!  Whoever heard of a mouse that's hard to click, right?  Well, it exists, and is not for the 50+ crowd.  Trust me.  Then I got a more expensive wireless mouse, but I don't use a mouse pad and that one didn't work well on the arm of my (leather) sofa.  Plus, it kept sliding off the arm of my sofa and getting lost.  This one though, works like a charm.  It feels good in the hand, and the matte-finish doesn't collect fingerprints or dirt.  It doesn't slip and slide off the (leather) arm of the sofa on its own, and it works beautifully.

It is a nuisance especially on Apple products.  So this is a back up mouse for me.  It has laser tracker which mean it can be used over about any surface except glass (but I used it on my glass covered desk by putting a piece of paper under the glass).  The surface is covered in a very slightly grippy plastic.  It makes it easy to hold but it is still just slickness enough to keep clean.

  Good tracking but doesn't fit very well in the hand.  I think it would be better if the top had more grip but it is slick (not like glossy plastic, which you can grip - this is a smooth rubber which isn't very grippable).  I really liked my old Microsoft optical mouse but I can't buy them anymore.  This one would be good if it was a little bigger and not slick.  My hands are medium size.  I feel like I need to use my thumb to pinch it to keep it in my hand, and the top does not engage my palm, so I feel like I am exerting too much energy to use it.  Maybe that's how small mice are; I know I just don't like this one.  But it's inexpensive!

  It is what it is. A super basic and cheap mouse to get the job done. If you game at all you will find that the texturized coating on the buttons wears off relatively easily so be careful with that.Otherwise it does exactly what it needs to do. Be a mouse. No issues with the cord, no lag or anything like that. Then again, I'm not on some huge gaming rig playing games at 100+FPS. I'm on a laptop doing a bit of casual gaming and the rest of it is normal web browsing and typing for work. My game of choice since I have had this mouse is Diablo III a super click-happy game like that is not what this mouse is meant for.
