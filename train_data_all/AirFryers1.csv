    My New Head Chef - Does All My Cooking for Me
  
",5.0,KG,"Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2019","First off, I absolutely hate cooking. I don't like the mess. It takes too much time. My recipes never turn out like they show in the cookbooks...and my cooking is pretty awful. I got the Cosori Air Fryer a couple of weeks ago, and I've been happily cooking every day, multiple times a day since.

You just pull it out of the box, and it's ready to go. The detachable basket and pan are all that needed cleaning in soapy water before adding food. The buttons are self-explanatory. You've got a snowflake for frozen foods, fries for fries, bacon for bacon, and also Preheat and Keep Warm.

When I first turned it on, I wasn't sure what to expect. I wondered if it was going to get hot and scorch my counter (or me). I thought it would be noisy. It was none of those things. It does get a little warm on the outside but not hot like an oven. You do need to be careful when you're pulling the basket out or any food from inside the fryer because it's deceiving that it works so quickly and gets food that hot that fast. As for noise, you can hear the air moving, but I wouldn't call it noisy. My Alexa is near the air fryer, and the Alexa hears me just fine when I'm talking while the air fryer is running. Also, since my Alexa is near the air fryer, you can tell that the air fryer doesn't get too hot or spit things at you or I wouldn't have the Alexa there.

The air fryer looks great on my counter too. It's already become a conversation piece in my kitchen. I had family over this weekend, and they wanted to know what it was. I put on a kitchen demo of sorts, and everyone stood around and watched, then ate all of the food (not a crumb left on the plates!), and then they said they needed to get an air fryer too.

So far, I've tried recipes in the included recipe book as well as a recipe for chicken fried steak in an air fryer cookbook I purchased separately. What's great about the cookbook included in the Cosori air fryer is that each recipe has a picture with it, and the ingredients aren't intimidating to those of you like me who don't care for cooking. Most recipes call for ingredients you've actually heard of and probably have in your pantry -- a real plus for me because I also hate wandering around in a grocery store searching for a random ingredient I'll only use once.

The very first recipe I tried was sweet potato fries in the included Cosori cookbook. I like my fries a little crunchy, so I probably could have left them in the air fryer a few minutes longer than the recipe called for, but they were still delicious. Definitely the best sweet potato fries I've ever had.

For fun, I then threw in some frozen okra I had bought in the freezer section. I bought a water bottle and filled it with olive oil, so all I did was lightly squirt the olive oil on the okra while in the air fryer basket and then just pushed the snowflake button. The okra came out so crunchy, just the way I like it. And I couldn't believe it had gone from frozen to crispy crunchy in just a matter of minutes. Most of them were golden brown, but I could tell the ones that I had missed when I sprayed the okra with the olive oil. Those were white -- still crunchy and tasted fine, but a weird-looking white. I've since bought a pressurized oil sprayer can that's specifically for spraying olive oil, and it works much better at spraying everything evenly than my plastic water bottle.

Same night and onto my third recipe: chicken fried steak. Now, this recipe wasn't in the incuded Cosori cookbook. This particular cookbook didn't have a picture, so I wasn't at all sure how it would turn out. It's so good, I've cooked it twice in three nights.

That night's entire meal was cooked in the air fryer: sweet potato fries, frozen-turned-air fried okra, and chicken fried steak. It felt like an elaborate meal with hardly any time invested, and my kitchen wasn't a disaster after cooking all of that. I only had a few plates and a couple of bowls that I'd used instead of pots and pans and baking dishes all piled up on my counter with a greasy stove to clean.

The next day, I tried the mozzarella cheese sticks in the included Cosori cookbook. I totally botched this recipe, using baking soda instead of cornstarch. Did I mention how bad I am at cooking? Even so, the mozzarella sticks worked out okay (but not great, which was likely my own fault). They crisped up nicely and quickly. They just didn't look a thing like the picture in the recipe book. I would have also liked the cheese to be more melted on the inside. It seemed like the outside was really crispy and the inside wasn't really melted. This could all be because of my using the wrong ingredient, so I'll give it another shot because, even with the wrong ingredient, they weren't bad. They didn't taste like mozzarella cheese sticks, but they were still good.

For dinner, I cooked the kids grilled cheese sandwiches also using the included cookbook. These didn't turn out as expected. At least I used the right ingredients this time. But the cheese wasn't gooey like it would be if you cooked it on the stove. If I had doubled the amount of cheese the recipe called for it would probably be perfect. The bread was golden brown, though. It was a bit of a pain to have to melt butter on the stove, then brush it onto the bread, then grate cheese before putting it into the air fryer. I can get a grilled cheese sandwich in a pan quicker than that, but it was still fun to try. I'll try the recipe again with more cheese. I think it's a recipe I can tinker with to make perfect.

I then tried the pizza from the Cosori recipe book. I didn't use pizza dough. I prefer pita bread. I followed the instructions as if it was pizza dough, which means you preheat the air fryer, brush your crust with olive oil, and then put it in the air fryer at 320 for five minutes. Then you take it out to add toppings. On mine, I put pizza sauce, pepperoni, mozzarella, and parmesan. Pop it back into the air fryer for another five minutes at 320, and it's done. It was so good. I'll be making another for lunch. The only downside was having to cook one at a time because I couldn't fit two pieces of pita bread in the basket together.

My most-recent recipe to try is the coconut shrimp, which is also in the cookbook that comes with the air fryer. What would normally be a giant mess of the kitchen was only three bowls to dredge the coconut shrimp and then a plate to put them on. You preheat the air fryer while you're getting everything ready, and then pop the shrimp in for eight minutes. They were very tasty, but I'll add more coconut in my dredge next time than the recipe calls for. The recipe was good, but I couldn't really taste the coconut.

I keep picking out new recipes to try in the cookbook, which is a first for me with my loathe of cooking. I've included pictures of the country fried steak, pizza, grilled cheese, mozzarella sticks, and coconut shrimp that I've made so far.

Even owning the 5.8 quart, you have to get used to cooking in batches. I wanted to make four chicken fried steaks that first night, but there was only room for two. Not a big deal. You just have to cook in batches. Making three pita bread pizzas, I just had to make each one separately since I could only fit one round piece of pita in at a time. For the grilled cheese sandwiches, two actually fit into the air fryer at the same time.

Like I said before, the cookbook that comes with the air fryer is full of pictures. It also has more than 100 pages of recipes. For example, you'll find recipes for strawberry cream scones, stuffed french toast, BBQ bacon, ribeye, meatballs, fried chicken, crab cakes, wings, pigs in a blanket, french fries, onion rings, roasted corn, cheddar buttermilk biscuits, cinnamon rolls, pound cake, and orange cranberry muffins. I would be lost without the cookbook. It also tells you exactly which button to push on the air fryer too, so you're learning about how to use your air fryer while you're actually cooking instead of having to read an instruction manual cover to cover before you even have enough confidence to cook something.

I mentioned not having many dishes to clean after using the air fryer. What I love most about cleanup is how easy the air fryer itself is to clean. Everything just slides off of it. I'm barely scrubbing it, and it's clean. I know the description says it's dishwasher safe, but I just wash it in the sink because there's nothing ever dried on and stuck to it. I love how I can put a little soap on it, and it's clean and ready for my next recipe. The water beads on it, so it dries really fast.

The only negative about the air fryer is probably my own impatience with one of the controls. The temp/time is shared by one button. If you have a recipe that calls for you to adjust the temp and/or time, you have to toggle the button. It starts with temp, so if you need to change how long to keep something in, you hit the temp/time button again. Somehow, I keep managing to hit time when I mean temp and vice versa.

Also, the air fryer cuts off when you pull the basket out, just as it should so it's not running while there's nothing in the bottom. When you pop the basket back in, it defaults back to the original temp and time settings when you turn it on, not what you last had on there. It would be nice if it remembered what your setting was 5 minutes before. For example, the other night when I had to make the pizzas in batches, I had to run the air fryer 5 minutes for one crust, then five minutes for the next, and so on. Every time, I had to reset the time and temp when I pulled a crust out. That's when I began noticing how bad I was at toggling the temp/time button I mentioned above.

Both the time/temp button being shared and the air fryer not remembering your last time/temp are extremely minor downsides. But they're the only negatives I could think of because this air fryer has quickly become my favorite kitchen appliance.

I have never had any experience with an air fryer, so I have nothing to compare the Cosori air fryer against. But I did my research. read the reviews, watched videos, and crossed my fingers that I was buying the right one. I couldn't have made a better choice. I'm actually excited to cook for the first time ever. Tomorrow on the breakfast menu: french toast sticks!", 5.8 QTEarly Reviewer Rewards(What's this?)

    Makes puddles on your counter from the leaking steam... Support says that's perfectly normal!
  
",1.0,Bill,"Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2019","









  
  
    
  Air fryer works. One major complaint is the basket / drawer leaks steams as it cooks which leaves puddles on whatever surface you have the air fryer. If you press lightly on the basket / drawer the steam stops leaking out which means either the product wasn't designed well or manufacturing tolerances are poor. Even though it works, I wouldn't recommend as the mess it makes it just too annoying to keep cleaning up after every use.** Updated 11/11/19 **After Cosori support saying that leaking steam from the basket is normal, I am reducing my overall rating to 1 star as this product is clearly made cheaply / poorly designed. Definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND buying from this manufacture and go with a competitor's product that doesn't leak steam and make a mess on your countertop.

  After hearing rave reviews from family and friends about using Air Fryers I thought it would be a good solution for preparing meals for one that didn’t take long to prepare, made for easy cleanup, used less energy and would allow me to have a variety of delicious meals. Unfortunately my experience with the Cosori Air Fryer has been nothing but disappointing. I’ve used it to cook steak which took much longer to cook than the literature suggested and it didn’t brown up at all. I’ve tried cooking French fries using raw potatoes and after nearly 30 minutes at 400 degrees I had limp fries that I wasn’t interested in eating. I’ve tried frozen French fries that I even sprayed lightly with canola oil hoping to help crisp them up, and again ended up with limp fries after nearly 30 minutes. I don’t know if the fan isn’t working or what the problem is but I’m not at all happy with this product.

    SO EASY TO USE!
  
",5.0,nativehoosier,"Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2019","









  
  
    
  I chose this particular air fryer over hundreds offered on Amazon.  Features that were the most important to me were the number of presets (counting defrost)  (12), the warranty (1 yr), Cosori accessories, and ease of use.  It is easy to clean in the dishwasher, and the preset settings mean that I don't have to calculate time or temperature. But it's also easy to add time or subtract it if you need to. The night I received my air fryer, I made the most amazing steaks that were so tender and moist inside!  Since then, I have made Cornish hens, BBQ ribs, blueberry muffins, tater tots, and many other dishes. The fryer is not heavy and it is not loud when in use.  Do yourself a favor and buy this!

  My Wife and I purchased the Air Fryer and received it Sunday.  So far we have only used it twice,  but so far it is great!  We cooked Crab Cakes last night with some tater tots and biscuits this morning for breakfast.  Really easy to use and easy to clean.  So far we both love it.UpdateWe have had it a few weeks now and continue to enjoy it.  We did buy some accessories that work, but I wish that there were some designed specifically for the 5.8 QT Air fryer.  These were made for both which means they are really too small to take advantage of the 5.8 QT volume.  They only ""kind of"" work.We still love the fryer.  That is why I did not change the star rating.  But I really would like to see some specific accessories designed for the increased volume of this fryer.

  This air fryer is awesome! I need a large basket for walleye and this is the largest I could find (10x10), which was a selling point. However, there are so many benefits! The programmed options, the ease of cleaning, the safety button on the basket, the price, just to name a few. I've only had it a few days and I've already made a home for it on my counter and replaced my smaller, less versatile Phillip's air fryer with this dynamo. I'll keep the other one for things like fries or potatoes, while using this one for the main items.  I haven't looked at the recipe book but I'm going to do so soon. One more thing, I shop on Amazon very often and this is one of the few reviews I feel compelled to write.

  Purchase this Air-Fryer. I did all the research for you. I spent 3 days researching air fryers pouring over hundreds of reviews, specs and videos.Very convenient. I purchased for my 70+ year old mother's birthday on August 27, 2019. Although mom was a great cook, she no longer enjoys the hassle of cooking now. But this Cosori air fryer has reunited her joy for cooking. She enjoys trying the many recipes included with the device as well as going on Google to find new recipes.Chicken Thighs and hicken wings are big hit. I actually prefer the wings from the air fryer than any restaurant wings. Even shrimp came out great. I worried the texture of vegetables such as squash and zucchini would not do well but I was wrong. The vegetables were great as well.The preset cooking settings make cooking super simple. The shake alarm is really helpful because it's important to turn food to prevent burning and insure even cooking.I highly recommend this new model of the Cosori air fryer. It's basket is relatively larger than others in same price range so you can cook more at same time. Also it has a smart wifi feature which allows you to control the device with your phone.

I do  a lot of grilling in the summer but I don't like cooking meat indoors because of the smoke and grease that gets everywhere.  This air fryer does not smoke and grease does not escape.  Everything I have made so far has come out very well cooked and delicious.  It's also very fast.  I have no complaints so far and I'm very glad I got this air fryer.

Best money I've ever spent on a counter appliance.  It definitely has plenty of room for a family of 4. I made 4 good size stuffed chicken breast at one time.

  This air fryer is amazing and I bet this would be my best purchase on amazon in 2019! I've watched air fryer for a long time and hadn't decided until noticed this one. Most air fryers can only work manually to set up time and temperature, which is not suitable for me. I'm always trying to make my kitchen smarter and this wireless-connected air fryer would be the best choice for me! I can prepare meat or veggies in ahead and just put it in the air fryer. I only need to open the air fryer on my way home. Everything is super easy and the receipt book really helps to prepare.Notes for cleaning issues: put aluminum foil and get rid of washing it.

  We loved how the product worked the first two times we used it but it stopped working after we preheated it to cook with it our third time. After only having it a week we had friends over, tried to cook wings and the air fryer stopped working after a few minutes. It acted as if the timer went off and it completed the cooking process and would not restart. After troubleshooting it would turn on and immediately turn off. We even tried waiting a day and re try it but it did the same thing. Product is being returned and replaced so hopefully it will work next time around.***Update***We received our replacement quickly and absolutely love this airfryer! It does seem to cook a couple of minutes quicker than the recommended times for air fryers which is nice. It's been a few months and we haven't had any problems with it.

I have a 1930 house and anything that is going to ""take up space"" has to earn its spot, while doing all of this research I still didn't like the egg shape of the other air fryers....then pops up this beautiful Cosori!! After reading all the reviews and showing my husband we were sold!! I received it last Thursday and have used it everyday since. It cooks perfectly, noise level is low, and is it gorgeous on my countertop. I'm a person that doesn't like anything sitting out, but I love walking into my kitchen and seeing it. I am also not a person that leaves reviews and here I am leaving my first review. I would definitely buy this again and have already started tell all my friends and some strangers about this beauty. I wish I would have known about Cosori before I bought my Instant Pot. Thank you Cosori for a well made, and thinking out of the box (or egg) design.

    Broke down in less than 4 months, Amazon solution less than stellar
  
",1.0,bethbb,"Reviewed in the United States July 6, 2019","









  
  
    
  I set up the Cosori Air Fryer as instructed and placed it on the counter with plenty of ventilation for all sides. Initially the unit worked as described. After about a month, the unit started to shut down intermittently. I thought it was because it was getting hot. I was confused as to  why it would perform this way. I plugged it into different outlets to see if that would resolve the issue. This did not. Finally, it died. It was used less than a dozen times during a three month period.I called Amazon to initiate a return. The rep issued a return label less the cost of shipping, which reduced the refund by about $26. I asked why as the unit was clearly defective. The rep said that it was because it was after the 30-day return window. I said that the defect did not manifest until after a month, and that there was no way to know that it would be defective before then. I asked to speak with a manager, who basically repeated the same policy. The manager did offer to give me the contact information of the manufacturer. She made clear that they would not issue a refund, but would likely reissue another unit. I had lost confidence in the unit given how quickly it puttered out. The manager stated that the refund less the shipping was all that could be done.Left with two options, a) refund less shipping or b) risk another defective unit and another return scenario, I opted for the first option. I was, nevertheless, deeply disappointed and frustrated that Amazon came short on rectifying the situation. To be clear, I do not blame the rep or the manager. They were friendly and professional. They seemed limited to the policy.The policy is at issue. This is an electronic unit with electronic complexities. Customers of such units would be better served with longer return windows than 30 days, or whatever the scientific average is for electronic units to manifest defects.Amazon, if you are reading this, please consider variable return windows given unit complexities/categories. Perhaps, algorithms can figure out reasonable expectations.

  I received this air fryer a few months ago as my wife wanted one.  She has tried a lot of ones on here but she always found fault with either them being too small or not powerful enough. She noticed many of them had baskets that the non stick flaked off just after a few uses so she has informed me that this one has a great coating. I think it may be ceramic but anyway she says it is a breeze to clean.She thought it was making weird noises so she contacted Customer Support and within a few hours she had a response. They asked her to video tape the unit in operation and once reviewing the video they got right back to her and said it was normal so we know they stand behind their products.My wife uses it every day making bacon, sausage and home fries for breakfast and many scrumptious meals.We get the frozen battered haddock fillets so on Fridays we make our fish fry and it cooks in half the time of the oven.She made bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and bacon wrapped fillet mignon and they came out crispy on the outside and juicy inside.I have posted a picture of our last nights dinner. She put a dry rub on the wings and cooked with fries and they too came out crispy and juicy and the fries were nice and crunchy but fluffy inside.I am so glad she kept trying fryers til she got the one that is the best available.I really do recommend purchasing this air fryer.  They do have a smaller version but we find this size is good especially if we get company.Great air fryer!!

As all the oil and excess water drips to the bottom basket, you can cook your proteins, then sides without using multiple pans or watching over the time like you would with a stovetop. You can even defrost.I chose this model as there is an app with recipes for inspiration, and also a way to start cooking from your phone, and get notified on when to shake or flip halfway.It also looks modern in my kitchen and makes a nice futuristic humming sound to boot.

  I bought this for my husband's birthday, he follows the keto diet and I thought this would be great for him. We followed the setup instructions, he preheated the air fryer and put in a layer of chicken wings. Halfway through, he pulled the basket out, flipped the wings and put the basket back in. It started cooking again for about 30 seconds and completely shut off, it wouldn't turn back on at all. We tried another appliance in that outlet to make sure we didn't blow a fuse, the outlet is working fine. My husband plugged the air fryer back in a few minutes later, it turned on and immediately off. This is getting returned.

  Took forever and did lots of research online. Couldn’t find on without negative feedback to took a chance on this one. I LOVE IT!!! I use it for everything. I made a cake in it ( use a little cake pan-it rises like crazy), I made scrambled eggs- when you put in a pan of course, and all kinds of frying. Our favorite is when I make chicken or beef in that Montreal rub, first, and make a batch of frozen vegetables after and tilt the pan so the meat juices cover the vegetables- WOW SO GOOD!!Cooks food in no time. Use it daily. One of my favorite purchases on Amazon.******* Now a word of advice, something I wish I knew before hand, DON’T SHAKE THE BASKET WITH THE BASE ON!!!! 🙄 It has a nonstick surface, not a smash proof  surface. When you shake your food, the basket taps the inside base and now I have a scratch on the inside base. So, just DISCONNECT THE BASKET THEN SHAKE. Then your solid! I got the white 5.8 and its great for a family of three. Super easy clean up- I wash mine by hand. Really really enjoying my fryer! ❤️❤️❤️

I bought a different one before this one and it was a nightmare.... So I looked up some more info on Air Fryers and came across this Cosori model. Bought it and have loved it since I took it out of the box! Soooo Easy to Use and soooo Easy to clean too! I've cooked 40lbs. of Chicken Wings in it since I got it. Italian Sausages, Hamburgers, Fresh French Fries, Cornish Hens, Biscuits, Eggs, Stuffed Mushrooms, Pizza, tater tots, Fish, I can go on... I really use this machine a lot... In fact, I use this and my other Fryer when making meals for my family... Quick and easy to do. I haven't had any issues with it... it turns on easily, cooks quickly, and clean up is a breeze... My disabled husband who only has use of one hand can use it easily as well... He even cleans it without a problem... One of the Best Investments I ever made in a kitchen appliance!

  Please do not buy this product. I purchased it in June and absolutely loved it. Recommended it to friends and loved trying new things in it. Today I had it on preheat to warm up some pizza for my son and we heard a weird sound and then saw a spark from underneath it. Luckily, we were both in the kitchen and saw it happen. I quickly unplugged it and my son said that he saw a flame from underneath. I turned it over and sure enough there was a flame and a burn mark on my counter. I was able to put it out, but it was a very scary moment for the both of us. Amazon was amazing and gave me a full refund even though I was way past my return window. Please be cautious it you have this product. Don’t leave the room while using it, it could have caused a lot of damage if I wasn’t right there. I am now in search of a new air fryer because it was something I used frequently. I will be contacting the company also as soon as I get their information.

  Actually received the air fryer the day after it was ordered.Prior to cooking, I ran the fryer on a preheat cycle of 400 deg. F for 5 minutes to eliminate any possible manufacturing/electrical residue.  There was somewhat of an electrical smell with this process, but that has been normal with other kitchen electrics I own.  (Some manuals will even direct you to run the appliance a few minutes to let it ""cure in""  and to expect an electrical odor.)  The odor dissipates and isn't an ongoing issue after curing.Started off with cooking tests of 3 inexpensive items:  meat, potatoes and bread.  I didn't use fresh items for the testing, but chose frozen sausage patties, frozen ""cubed"" hash browns, and canned biscuits.  I made certain to preheat the fryer for every item at the cooking temperature being used - the results were impressive.For the sausage patties, the fryer was preheated at 390 deg. F for 5 minutes then cooked at 390 deg. F.  Cook time was  6 minutes and patties were flipped over at 3 minutes.  The finished patties were tender and moist, just slightly browned around the edges, but not at all burnt or hard.  Wonderful result.  (Quite a bit of time saved over skillet cooked patties which I usually cook low and slow to keep them tender and avoid hardness/burning.)The fryer was cooled and preheated again at 390 deg. F.  The frozen cubed potatoes were lightly spritzed with EVOO, and cooked at 390 deg. F for 7 minutes.  With 3 minutes remaining, the potatoes were tossed well, seasoned with salt and pepper and lightly spritzed again.  (The potatoes weren't seasoned initially because I wanted to clearly see how well the fryer was browning them.)  The end result was light brown crusty edges and tender centers.  Perfect.  Better than oven roasted.Saving the canned biscuits for last,  I really thought this would be the challenge and was prepared for a re-do.  (I haven't been very successful in the past with canned biscuits in the GoWise Turbo air fryer.)  I set the fryer to preheat at 360 deg. F for 4 minutes and used the time to lightly butter both sides of the 5 biscuits.The biscuits cooked almost 5 minutes on 360 deg. F.  At 3 minutes remaining, I pulled the basket out and checked them with the intent of flipping them over.  But I decided to wait and see what the end result if they weren't flipped.  I was very surprised to see the end result were biscuits that looked as if they had been cooked in a conventional oven.  I literally could see no difference.  They rose perfectly, browned without burning and even had a light brown crust on bottom.  So there would have been no need to flip them at all -  another time saver and great looking biscuits!  Let me tell you I was happy !Keep in mind these tests weren't even run with fresh foods...so I can imagine how great fresh chicken, wings, ribs, steak, fresh seasonal vegetables and homemade breads will be!  There may be occasional tweeks with with temps and time, but from what I have seen thus far, this fryer will produce very good results if proper temp, time and techniques are used.  (And barring any unforeseen errors and issues with the unit of course.)Almost forgot to mention the KEEP WARM feature is going to be a real help to me since hubby's work hours aren't stable!  (Then there's that gorgeous cookbook that came with the fryer I need to cook through!)  Registered right away to capture the extra year warranty.P.S. - I also have the Cosori Multicooker which is a stellar performer.  It has Bake, Boil, Roast, Steam, Slow Cook (3 levels - Low/Med/High) , Saute, Simmer, Brown, Yogurt, Rice functions and also Manual programmable temperature and time input.  (You can also sterilize items with the Boil function) - Fantastic appliance.

  I was nervous about this air fryer.  The brand name was unfamiliar to me, but I bought it on the strength of customer reviews, which never seem to steer me wrong.  I am SO impressed with this air fryer, and I will definitely recommend it to friends and family.  I've had it for about a month, and because of the ease of cooking and cleanup, I've used it at least once a day and more.  I am calorie and fat content conscious, so I use an oil spritzer to lightly coat my foods.  I spray the basket with cooking spray when that is a recipe detail.  I've seen so many people say that something in cooking spray makes the nonstick coating on their air fryer baskets just peel right off.  I have used cooking spray countless times in my Cosori, and the coating has held up fine.I've seen some reviewers complain about the noise and the beeping.  I am, like, say what?  I was worried about the noise, but I've got to say that the complainers may have sensitive ears.  I like to know when my Cosori is finishing a cycle.  Then I can be right there to throw in more food if I'm doing two batches or a full meal.  I don't find the beeping sound or the fan sound of the machine to be offensive AT ALL.This machine cooks like a dream, I love it, and now wonder how I lived without it.  I love the French fries made in the Cosori.  I spritz them with EVOO, salt them, and sprinkle them with Messana dried parmesan, which is incredibly flavorful and very low calorie.  Stir them in the bowl to coat them, pop them into the Cosori, and diners are moaning with delight in 15 minutes.  Delicious and guilt free!Buy this machine.  Easy to clean.  No mess in the kitchen.  Creates fabulous dishes.  Last night I was dining alone, and in six minutes I had the most delicious salmon I've ever tasted along with parmesan French fries.  My kitchen was as clean as when I started.  I can choose to wash the pan and basket by hand or throw them in my dishwasher.  It's  toss up which I choose to do.  I only know my time, which is valuable, has been cut way back in my kitchen without sacrificing meal quality.  In fact, we are eating better and healthier!  I haven't enjoyed having French fries in a very long time.  Now I can enjoy them every day if I wish.  You should soak a freshly cut up batch of potato slices for 20 minutes, so when I peel potatoes and cut them up, I do several days' worth and put any I don't use in a container filled with water.  That way they are ready to blot dry and fry whenever we want fries.  They stay nice in a raw state in water for days on end.  Don't hesitate like I did.  Buy this wonderful baby.

    Works very well.  Some mixed results on certain items that I need to figure out.
  
",5.0,Slushpuppy154,"Reviewed in the United States November 22, 2019","









  
  
    
  This item works well overall and I have had zero serious issues with it.  It seems well built and I think that most of the reviewerss that mention the basket attachment point melting on their first use screwed up and didn't put the basket latching mechanism together correctly before running the machine that way.  That is technically a product design flaw that requires a modicum of caution for inexperienced users.  If the basket is sitting loose in the tray, it's not in there correctly and you will screw your machine up.  I have used mine at the highest temp setting for quite some time (I tend to run it hot because I like my food extra done).  My basket attachment point has not had a single issue thus far and I expect it to hold up nicely as time wears on.  I know a little bit about plastics as a 3d Printing enthusiast and this stuff seems built to hold up well enough to me UNLESS you screw up putting the basket in the tray.In use, the machine works really well overall.  It fries things with very little oil needed, but if you want the same texture as actual deep fried foods, you sometimes have to add a little extra oil if something has to cook for a while.  PREHEATING IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY unless you like very badly fried food.  Some foods don't react like you think they would to the massive amount of air circulation and you get kind of a staleness or dryness.  Others like the Broccoli and Cheese Veggie Tots were amazing right out of the gate when properly cooked (Best I have ever made).  Bacon in this thing is just incredible and so easy to make.  It shrinks up like mad, but it's all perfectly cooked with very little effort.  Going to try my hand at Country Ham this weekend.  Spam needs a low cook temp (320 or lower) to not flood your house with smoke (the fat in Spam has a low smoke point).  This thing is amazing at continuing the cooking process for lightly fried potato chips and tortilla chips.  No need to pay more for expensove dark russet potato chips from a major brand.  This cooker makes the cheap chips sing.Cleans easy.  The Software Design is not the best and requires a tad more button pressing than it should to use, but it's a minor complaint.  You can't press the buttons rapidly as they won't take input very quickly.  I wish the temp could go about 50 degrees higher overall, but it works pretty well regardless and it's far less messy than an actual grease deep fryer and uses less oil.

  I love, love, love this air fryer! I literally use it everyday. I researched several before taking the leap and purchasing this one and I’m so glad I did. Large square basket that feeds atleast a family of 4. The preset buttons cook spot on. So far, I have tried the fried chicken from the recipe book and my family said it was delicious. Nice and crispy. I temped the chicken and it was where it should be. I have always been nervous about cooking chicken on the bone, but not anymore! Being able to preheat the fryer makes cooking even faster, which I love. I’m on an eat clean low carb diet so I cook EVERY meal in it. When I’m cooking my food I normally just keep it at the 350 degrees 15 minute temp/time because it cooks so fast. It has a shake reminder, which I find very handy. Roasted mushrooms, zoodles, jalapeños, I couldn’t even name all that I cook in there but it’s very convenient and everything tastes great! It even crisps up frozen eggplant slices I have vacuum sealed in the freezer. Chicken slices coated in almond or coconut four come out CRISP. When you register your fryer you get an extra 1 year warranty so a total of 2 years Cosori will stand behind their product. The recipe book has tons of recipes with pictures that I can’t wait to tweak and make them where I can eat them. Or I could just make them how the book says and feed the others in my family :) Very detailed instruction booklet and quick reference guide included. Oh, and all the buttons on the touch panel are easy touch so you don’t have to worry about holding down a button or trying to get it to set right when you’re in the middle of cooking. I can go on and on about how much I love this thing, but I would probably put people to sleep!! I HIGHLY recommend!

  We have owned the appliance for a little over week now and used it almost every day in some fashion.  It cleans up very well and haven't had anything really difficult to remove yet that a few minutes soaking didn't resolve.  Chicken fries, stromboli and french fries came out much better than just oven baking.  It preheats faster than the toaster oven and cooks in less time.One quirk we don't like that it doesn't remember last temperature / time used.  Also, when shaking, sometimes it forgets the current settings causing you to have to input them again.The larger model is very tall.  We had problems storing it in the island cabinets.  Had to make room under the kitchen sink for storage.Beware that the max warranty for this item is two years.  We thought that you received a two year warranty, and then by registering on their site we would receive another year.  That is not the case.  You get one year warranty at purchase and another year if you register on their site.  I confirmed this by contacting warranty support.In conclusion, we really like the air fryer!  We think it will be great on camping trips where you can cook food outside the RV and having that extra heat stay outside on a hot, summer day.Edit:  fast forward 6 monthsStill working great and we have used it on our RV trips!  The large size works well for a family of 4.

  Overall this product is a great addition to any kitchen and amazing at adding a unique flavor to your food. Unless you’re deep frying now, I wouldn’t say this is “healthier”. I don’t add oil to my food unless I’m cooking in here so this is still our not so healthy meal.Cleaning:Cleaning this is horrid!!! I despise it! It is dishwasher safe but if I hand wash the basket every scrubby I have gets caught on the air ventilation holes.Foods:It’s excellent for frozen freezer veggies, reheating food etc.being a bigger basket DOES NOT mean you can put piles of chicken in it. It won’t crisp. So it’s not necessarily faster if you’re making a ton of food.Overall I do like it and use it maybe twice a month. It’s also fun to offer guests delicious home fried food.

  I bought the 5.8 qt on 10/27 and to be honest, I dislike cooking.  I have never in my life cooked wings before and (because the recipe was simple) I did them twice in one week, and they were delicious! As you can tell by my pix, I cook like a beginner. I've always opted for the microwave for its speed and simplicity.  But the Cosori cooks faster than a regular oven.  It's like having an EasyBake Oven, which I never had as a child.  If you're sitting on the fence debating about getting one, get off your butt and do it. There are more expensive ones around and some a lot cheaper. I got the red one because it was under $100 the day I purchased it.  My eating habits are certainly becoming much more healthy.  There are 100 recipes in the book that comes with the air fryer and they call for items you probably have on hand.

   I really like this air fryer. I have only had it for two weeks and have used it three times. Every time I use it excessive smoke comes out of the supposedly seals of the pull out drawer (see video) and sets off my smoke alarm (usually around 8-9 minutes).  This will be my third air fryer and have never experienced this before.  Also, I have reviewed all of the other reviews and did not see a pattern that this is normal.  I am literally afraid to use it.  If I still had the box I would return it.  I am just going to throw it out.  The food did come out good though and I absolutely love the smart features.  I am really disappointed because I have read really good things about the COSORI and many of the youTube videos I have watched for air fryer recipes use it.  Guess I just got a lemon.UPDATE:  I was contacted by Cosori (they actually contacted me) and just like other reviewers, they addressed my issue and sent me a new air fryer.  Great Customer Service.  It is so refreshing to deal with a company who stands by their product.  As I type, I am making wings for the first time in my new air fryer, and guess what, NO SMOKE.  Smells amazing!

  Arrived on time. Tried it that night. Made excellent breaded pork chops (see picture). My only concern is that there is a rattling noise that gets progressively louder and then abruptly stops (sounds like a loose part of some sort). I did line the outer basket with aluminum foil but I don't think that caused the noise. Overall, I can see myself using this for many years to come. The chops came out juicy and crispy as if I had deep fried them, with the satisfaction of knowing that it's healthier to some extent.  For those that bought this, is the noise in my video normal or do I have a defective unit? I don't really mind the noise I'm just scared that it will break down in the future or heavens forbid catch fire. 5 stars if it weren't for the noise.Update 2/1/2019:Arovast reached out to me via personal message and asked me to send a video of the appliance directly to them for analysis. It turns out that the unit indeed had an issue. I was ordered a replacement unit free of charge within 24 hours! Shirley was excellent in handling the issue and bringing a swift resolution.

Bought a 400 dollar Breville Smart oven that malfunctioned on day one. i had it....but I wanted an air fryer because I didn't want to fire up the oven every time I wanted to oven fry 4 pieces of chicken. I caved and got the Cosori.PROS: Large capacity (5.8 qt) Small profile compared to others. Non stick seems more durable than others (my habor started chipping after a few uses and hand washing).  After having made fried chicken in other air fryers, THIS one reigns supreme. It achieves something that other air fryers couldn't do. Normally, 'crispy' fried chicken in an air fryer just describes the skin being rendered to a point where its like a shell on the chicken. Sure, its crunchy, but it lacks the texture of fried chicken. The cosori somehow manages to get those little 'bubbles' in the skin like real fried chicken. It has more of the texture of real fried chicken.CONS: How long will it last? My past experience with other brands doesn't give me confidence. Sure, Cosori gives you a 2 year warranty...but I would rather have something that lasts than something you need to trade in every now and then...keeping in mind that once the 2 years is up...no more trade ins.Only time will tell.If you want to slide the basket out to flip food, its probably best to pull it completely out, otherwise the electronic control panel gets a blast of hot steam, which can't be good. Maybe the panel is protected from this? I'm not going to chance it. If it's not protected from hot steam, its a design flaw.Update: While performance on this air fryer is great, the unit died after 13 months. Cosori sent me a new one... but said 'because its close to the end of warranty' they will send a new one, but this new one will not be covered. This product  is advertised as a TWO YEAR warranty. I appreciate them sending me a new fryer, but I think they need to read their own literature.You WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED with the performance of this air fryer...when it works.

    Teflon rubs off after 3 months, is it safe?

  Love the convenience and size. Love the flavor and crispness. Love the functional aspects as finish of the cooking unit.However, the teflon on the cooking basket is already rubbing off. We use teflon safe sponges by scotch and haven't had any similar issues with our cookware. Primarily Im concerned about the safety of the coating since its pretty ‘suspect’ if its already wearing off (is it getting into our food, I dont know but I have two children which isnt worth the risk). It has the feeling if one of those ‘dollar store’ pans...Secondly, for it to show so much wear after 3 months is “cheap” and surprising for a unit that is so well designed otherwise. If it is a part that needs regular replacement, fine- then sell the replacement baskets and perhaps dont use teflon.

  I'll admit that the only reason I bought this, is because several people told me that air fryers make great steaks.I love a good steak, and have never been satisfied with any that I've made indoors.Every recipe I've seen says to cook steak at 400, but I usually cook very thick, 1Lb Ribeyes, and that seems to dry it a bit too much on the outside, while leaving the middle undone, so I reduced the temperature to 380 and slightly increased the cook time, and it came out perfect!Of course, the thickness of your steak is going to make a difference, so experiment a little!I simply marinated in McCormick's Garlic, Herb & Wine marinade and had the best homemade ribeye I've ever eaten.I have only had the thing a week so far, but have made steak 3 times, taquitos, frozen corn dog mini's, and frozen pre-breaded okra.The okra didn't turn out so good, so I'll need to experiment a bit more with that, but everything else was great.I read that spritzing a little oil on the okra first will have it coming out just perfect.I love that the flavor is sealed, foods are perfectly cooked on the outside and crisp when they are supposed to be crisp (like the corn dogs and taquitos), but not dried out on the inside.It is my first air fryer, but I believe I made the right choice going with the Cosori.It is super easy to use and super easy to clean.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this brand again!

  After months of research I finally decided on this model. I went back and forth between the models with windows vs the basket style like this one. Many helpful reviewers stated how easy it was to clean this unit - I think that’s what finally sealed the deal for me. I just wanted an air fryer that was easy to use and clean - if these factors are also important to you, look no further!Now let’s talk about what a great cooking job it does. The first meal I prepared was jerk chicken thighs (boneless, skinless). I marinated the meat overnight with jerk seasoning and cooked them in the (pre-heated) air fryer at 400° for 15 minutes. I pulled the tray out after 15 to flip the meat and realized there was no need - they were perfectly cooked. Crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside.The fryer has a sleek, low-profile design and won’t take up too much room on your counter top (no more than a standard toaster oven). If you’re lucky enough to have lots of cabinet space, it will tuck away nicely.I am just getting started with this thing but am very happy with my purchase. Happy cooking!

    thermostat caused shut down on high temps above 350
  
",3.0,Richard,"Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought this and it worked great for about 2 weeks, then I began having issues. It would turn on and off during the cooking process repeatedly anytime I set the temperature above 360 degrees for very long. It eventually shut itself down completely and would not power up after I tried 400 degrees for cooking. I thought it was dead and was going to throw it out in anger. A few days later I tried it again, and it powered up fine. I tried to preheat to 400 degrees and it made it about 4 minutes or so before it began cycling on and off. I backed the temperature back down to 350 and it works fine for any length of time at that temperature. Maybe I can push it to 360 degrees, but I know 380-400 degrees causes problems. The thermostat seems to be shutting the unit down due to overheating of the inside of the unit. I have noticed this air fryer seems to cook a little hot for the displayed temperature. French fries start to burn at the end of cooking the allotted time when the readout says I'm at 360-380. Maybe the display and actual temperature are not calibrated correctly. Maybe this is only my unit, or maybe its more prevalent in other units, I don't know. In any event ,it's pretty functional and is a of good size. Just average in overall quality as all these air fryers are almost the exact same regardless of brand in this price range, all made in China. You get what you pay for.

  Buyer beware! It may seem like an amazing deal but these air fryers are shoddily made. I purchased this air fryer and it worked well for a day while using the app, but when I went to use it without the app, the three buttons did not work, the temperature setting buttons! The whole middle area of the touch sensor did not work. So I asked for a replacement and that one was even worse! 60% of the touch areas did not work, including the power button. I also noticed they sent me a refurbished one instead of a brand new one. That is not what I paid for. I can no longer trust Amazon's supply chain to order appliances. I feel like the whole chain is tainted by bad actors and they are too big and oblivious to take any credible actions to mitigate this. All they can do is offer a $5 credit for your troubles. I do not know about you but I value my time and it is worth more than $5. Think twice before ordering any appliances from Amazon.

  I have nothing but great complements on the design and results based upon first two uses.  On third time it failed completely - shut down and screen was blank.  After 30 minutes it beeped and restarted.  So I tried it again.  Same failure occurred again - shut down and reset after 20-30 minutes.  As I kept trying it the failure problem seemed to disappear most of the time.  I was so satisfied when it worked I just kept trying to figure out what was going wrong - some component internally is a problem in the first one.Contacted Cosori.  They were very helpful and would assist in replacing it.  Excellent customer support.Received a replacement the next day from Amazon.While I initially received one with a defect I am very satisfied with the second air fryer.  It is well designed, the right size for 2 - 4 people depending on what you are cooking.  I am developing my own recipes for food my wife and I like.  We'll take the air fryer traveling with us this summer in that we prefer our own food over restaurant food most of the time.  We have cooked biscuits, muffins, corn bread, chicken, turkey thighs, hamburgers, pork ribs, pizza (home made), kabobs, etc. as we see how much we can do with an air fryer.Very pleased with the design and replacement air fryer.

  After using this for the first time, I can honestly say there is no such thing as ""air frying"".This is nothing more than a counter top convection oven. Heating unit up top to brown, hot air circulated within the chamber to heat.I used my oven fried chicken recipe and tried it in this Air Fryer. The chicken came out the same, aside from the fact I had to make it in 2 batches, due to space, as oppossed to one batch.Maybe it's because I already make my food in my large convection oven. The results are the same. Crispy on the outside; moist and tender in the middle. Little to no oil.As for french fries. I won't even try them. Fries you find in the freezer isle of your local grocer are unhealthy to begin with. Read the ingredients. Some of them require a degree in chemistry to understand what's in them. Plus, they are already laced with oil and sodium. Making them in the air fryer does not change their ingredients, or, in my opinion, make them healthier for you as opposed to making them in my convection oven. I now opt for fresh russets, toss with oil, and roasted on parchment paper in my oven.So, I guess it is just a matter of opinion. As for me, there is no such thing as ""air frying"". Trying to cut sodiuim, fat, and carbs, I'll continue with my tried and true tested methods used in my convection oven. Low oil, low to no sodium, roasted on parchment paper. Sometimes going back to basics is so much healthier and easier than all these new, must have latest devices.

    Good air fryer, but read the phone app permissions
  
",4.0,Kyle,"Reviewed in the United States January 18, 2020","This is my first air fryer.
I was skeptical about air fryers but I have barely used my oven in the 2-3 weeks since I got this.
The controls are simple and intuitive.
I like the pre-sets which make it easy to simply put my food in and push a button.
I can use the pre-set temperature and time, or fine tune it to my liking.
I can also choose not to use a pre-set, and instead I can manually enter a temperature and time.
(Be advised that by manually entering a temperature and time you will not get a reminder to shake or turn your food)
I like that it is quiet during operation.
I like that the non-stick inner basket makes clean up very easy.

There are a few things I would like to see improved on this air fryer.

The handle which attaches the inner basket to the lower basket feels like it will not stand the test of time.
I think this would be better if the inner basket and its handle were one solid piece instead of a plastic handle fastened to the basket.
The clear plastic piece covering the button which releases the inner basket from the lower basket feels like it is about to fall off at any moment.

The biggest issue, in my opinion, is the app itself.
There are things this app has permission to do on your phone which make me refuse to install it, such as:
DIRECTLY CALL PHONE NUMBERS...excuse me? in what way is this needed to control an air fryer?
Read your contacts - no thanks, this will be followed by those on my contacts receiving spam calls.
Modify or delete contents of USB storage
Take pictures and videos
Uninstall shortcuts

There are other permissions which I find questionable, but those are the ones that I find most concerning.

That being said, I do like the air fryer itself.

If you are reading this and considering buying it, my advice is to buy this air fryer.

    Highly Recommend the 5.8 qt Cosori Air Fryer
  
",5.0,Dawn2140,"Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2019","









  
  
    
  At the end of December I finally decided to purchase an air fryer.  After looking at several I decided on the Cosori 5.8 qt.  Everything I have tried in the Cosori, frozen french fries, onion rings, breaded okra, beer battered fish, chicken nuggets, fresh salmon, tater tots, and pepper poppers, have turned out crispy and delicious.  I find it very easy to use.  It has several presets as well as manual controls. I like the shake reminder when using the frozen preset and that it turns off when you pull out to shake and back on when you return the basket. The square basket allows everything to fit inside nicely and clean up is a breeze.  The size of this fryer is too large to leave out on my kitchen counter but it is easy to lift in and out of my pantry when needed. I was impressed that they offered a two year warranty, tells me they stand behind what they are selling and I am hoping if I ever have a problem their ""Need Help? Talk To Us! statement on the very nice recipe booklet I received with customer service information will prove to be as helpful as the statement sounds.  I am not sure why it took me so long to take the air fryer plunge, but I am glad I chose the 5.8 qt. Cosori air fryer and hope it continues to prove to be an excellent decision and purchase on my part.

    Upgrading it to a 5, since it's exchange...

  My wife and I didn't really need anything for Christmas, so she had the idea of purchasing an air fryer.  We had purchased a pressure cooker a while back and we don't really use it, even though it's a nice one.  In part, I think we're kind of creeped out by using a high pressure device, and that's no doubt just an ""us"" problem.So I read about these things and bought this Cosori 5.8 qt model with Alexa / WiFi connectivity, not that I think I'll ever use that connectivity, but for $10 more after a coupon, why not?  And we are a full Alexa house, so you never know.  It allows you to upload recipe parameters.So far we absolutely love this Cosori.  We've purchased a french fry slicer and made outstanding french fries.  We've made burgers in it - both frozen and from ground beef.  We've done the grilled ham and cheese and tuna melts, though these will take some experimenting with as the top can blow off of the sandwich or the bread can end up too dry (maybe MORE butter?).  My wife has done frozen fish in it.  We also bought the extra accessories and have even made pizzas from pre-made dough and we're getting ready to try premade crusts that don't have to be thawed.  We've also done the breakfast sandwiches.  It makes excellent bacon.  This is probably some of the best bacon we've made.The recipe book does have some minor issues, the one that I remember first and foremost is that if you get a pound of ground beef to make sliders, and this is what the recipe calls for - 1 pound of ground beef - the recipe then tells you to fashion it into 4 evenly formed patties.  But that's a 1/4 burger.  That's not a slider.  It makes about 8 sliders using my burger press with the slider piece, and they're GREAT.  We've encountered a couple other minor things in the recipe book, but if somebody as bad in the kitchen as me can figure those out, anybody can.  If only there was an easy mechanism to recommend corrections.Originally, I rated this as a 4 star due to what was definitely a defective control panel that made changing the temperature and time a serious hassle.  Amazon exchanged the unit and while the replace did have a periodic vibration, that appears to have gone away, hopefully for good?  The control panel on the new unit appears just fine.In addition to the extra accessories, I even went so far as to buy the Ramekins in two sizes for both eggs and deserts, basting brushes for spreading the olive oil nicely on the burgers, etc.  I just ordered additional pizza pans so we can have them stacked up and ready to use.  And that leads to the next thing.  If you're like me, you'll find that you actually enjoy using this thing so much, you'll want to use it as often as possible.  The problem is that, for example, making pizzas for three?  Well, you can only do one at a time.  Same deal when making an 8-pack of ready to bake biscuits.  You can only do 4 at a shot.  We've jokingly tossed around the idea of purchasing a second unit, or maybe a bigger one?  We'll have to see.  I will tell you this - I'm horrible in the kitchen and this thing is actually making me look like I'm talented at preparing food.

",4.0,Marie,"Reviewed in the United States February 6, 2019","









  
  
    
  I heard so much about these things that I had to give it a try. The fact that this one has a Pre-Heat setting is what tipped the scales for me. That helps with the crisping of foods.We are a family of 5 and I got the 5.8qt. size fryer. It holds plenty, yet it has a low profile and fits under my kitchen cabinet.For those of you, like me, who were confused on what this appliance actually is; it’s really a counter-top convection oven. Not a “fryer”. It circulates hot air around your food. The result is nicely cooked veggies, seafood, etc. in a short amount of time. The veggies turn out great... similar to roasting but it takes a lot less time. Just toss your what you’re cooking lightly in olive oil and the machine does the rest.It’s also very easy to clean.  The only thing I would improve is the release button on the basket... it’s a little tricky at first to get the hang of... but after a few surprise drops, I’m now trained to make sure it’s resting a counter before releasing the basket. We’re having fun with it so far.This would be a good appliance for very small apartments, motor homes, or boats because it can actually function as your main oven.

We love the larger 5.8 quart size and is non-stick and cleans *super* easily which is great for someone like me who hates to wash dishes.A few tips to convince anyone on the fence about getting an air fryer:  - Costco pre-cooked bacon tastes AMAZING in this.  - Leftover pizza tastes even better than fresh pizza in 5 minutes, no preheat needed.  - Tons of Trader Joe's frozen foods cook perfectly and really easily in this like their cauliflower gnocchi, chicken tenders, corn, and turning fresh asparagus and butternut squash zigzags into alternative fries.  - Leftover veggies reheat well in this with a nice char which makes it better than the fresh dishOur so-called ""instant"" pot is never coming up from under the counter again while this Cosori air fryer is the only table-top appliance we don't store away between uses because we use it so often.

It's terrible and if I didn't throw the box away it would be returned.Update:After using this fryer for a few months it gets 1 star. It cooks fine, when I can use the buttons... However the basket has screws that need to be tightened regularly or the basket will not lock together and the base will fall off. This has happened twice while loaded with food, which ended up on the floor.Lastly the 3rd party app that they use to control the Wifi, which I only use because the buttons don't function properly, tracks your location. I find that completely unacceptable. When I spoke with the app company they say it so they can set the clock. (seriously..... )

There is a user manual which you should take the time to read and a recipe book about 110 pages of recipes. was starving but I went over it and over the manual.As my pictures show it was larger than I thought as I live in an apt. Make sure you have counter space to have 5"" from your wall as steam escapes from the rear.*** There is a plastic cover over the basket release button.  Please make sure it's in place so it won't be pushed by accident. It will release the inner basket which is holding the outer basket and also have a solid surface to place it on before you release. I put mine on the large burner on my stove as there wasn't enough room on counter. It was enough room to pull it out so I could flip the scallops.I didn't release it until I was ready to wash it. I had to give a slight tug to remove basket from fryer because it is new. It should slid out easier with more use. The manual is very informative and the display is easy to use with pictures of preset food items.I will purchase additional accessories such as ramakens, cake and pie pan as some recipes call for them. I do have some small glass containers I can use. You can use Pyrex or anything you can use in an oven. Also a sprayer for oil.My first use was for jumbo scallops. I didn't have a sprayer so I used paper towels to dab olive oil lightly and Old Bay seasoning. There wasn't a recipe or temp and cook time so I did a search online. I did preheat of 390 and cooked at 390 for 2 mins each side. Checked and did another minute. I should of used the preset fish instead of shrimp but I'm learning.They came out delicious. They don't get brown like searing them in butter but the Old Bay added some color to them. I have Alaskan Pollack fillets I am trying next and pork chops. So far I love it and look forward to using it daily.I will do an update.***Update*** Love cooking with this! issue is the cookbook fell apart and I had only browsed through it once and a metal prong seperated from the skewer rack so I went down a star.

    Faster than an Oven, Easy to Clean, Needs Less Time than Recommended
  
",5.0,CMD,"Reviewed in the United States May 3, 2019","









  
  
    
  This is my first air fryer.  It is basically a small convection oven that needs 3 - 5 minutes to pre-heat.  Cooking is about 20-40% faster than a normal oven.  Get the bigger size. We need to make a meal for 2 - 4 people and you want you food to lie flat for the best roasting. Temperature max is 400 degrees.Pros:- Preset - Buttons are easy to use.  French fried, carrot (root vegetables), meat, etc.- The cooking book and recipe manual are very helpful.- Clean-up is super easy - the metal is very non-stick as is the bottom pan that catches the drips- You can use a preset button to get an idea of recommended temperature and time but use the Time/Temp button to adjust it down- On the presets, it beeps half way through for you to ""shake"" the food which is helpful to see how cooked they are- I finally was able to make roasted brussel sprouts with a maple glaze that have not worked out in my normal oven- There was a plastic smell the first time I used it and a faint hint in the food, but now I do not notice it. The cooking area where your food is is metal.Cons:- Big and high so it does not fit in my pan cabinet- French fry preset was way too long.  Need about 12 minute instead, total.Tips:- Adjust the time to less than what is recommended or else they may be dry and overcooked- Spray the vegetables with olive oil and I use tongs to ""toss"" them around at the mid-point alarmI was worried about buying this brand since I had never heard of it before.  I have made complete meals, cooking the veggies separate from the cut chicken in the air fryer, and I am very happy with the purchase.  I have been using for about 3 weeks.

  It's almost twice the size of my other one.  If they made a bigger one I'd get it.  I own a smoker and would cook ribs in it for 6 hours.  I've cooked ribs in my oven.  But, 30 minutes in this air fryer makes the best ribs I've eaten.  I don't even use sauce.  Just seasoning.Bacon just 15 minutes for crispy just right.  Fries are great.  Steaks come out like they were on a grill.

  I adore this machine. My mom and I have been wanting an air fryer for years now and shopped around EVERYWHERE for the very best one. Of course, Amazon had the best deal but was it the right one? For us? My mom’s not good at computers yet I am, what can I find that will work for us both? She needs something that she can easily figure out to use on her own while I want something that isn’t archaic looking with knobs and a CVS receipt-like list of instructions. Well, this was the answer to our prayers!It’s modern, easy to use (functions operate like a regular oven), easy to clean and figure out. Also, everything you put in it comes out instantly more delicious!We bought the accessories and the recipe book, as well, and I’m planning on cooking up a storm for Mother’s Day 2019 using just this air fryer and the recipe book! I don’t even like to cook!Forget that foods are 85% healthier because of less oil, this is so much fun! From breakfast to dessert, I’ve never been so happy to eat!P.S. My one complaint is that it is noisy to me, nothing above annoying level but it does make a consistent sound when powered on. Dependent on your kitchen layout, it could be annoying. If I’m in the kitchen with it, it’s annoying; if I’m not, it’s fine. My mom doesn’t mind it because she says you need to know when it’s on, depends on the person, I guess.

  Works amazingly well! I've had another air fryer, but it's nothing compared to this one. Cooked my fries within 25 min, crispy, and tasty. My only complaint is the basket is difficult to dislodge from the pan itself, and I've almost dropped it as a result (why I gave 4 stars instead 5). They need to work on a better means of releasing the basket so we can wash it, and retrieve the food from it. Other than that, I'm very happy with my purchase. I've already registered for the warranty to get the extra year. Very satisfied customer.

  I'm sorry to say I'll have to change my review from 5 Stars to One Star.  I had learned to cook many different foods in my Cosori Air Fryer.  I have bragged to my cooking friends and relatives about how good the food was when cooked in the Cosori.  My daughter from TN visited us today and I was showing off demonstrating how to use the Cosori when the heating element in the Cosori quit.  The fan started blowing cold air.  My husband and I were cooking with this Air Fryer almost everyday.  I loved the foods I had learned to cook in my Cosori.  I am extremely disappointed that it only worked for four months.  I'll have to try another brand of Air Fryer.

  Review COSORI Smart WiFi Air Fryer 5.8QTPro:-Good size not to big and tall, inside is wide.-Fast Cooker!-Simple to use-Have Good Wifi rang-Smart Feature can notify me on the phone when the food is done! Also custom your meal setting.-Easy to clean!Con:-Inside might be wide, but  the basket is wasting some space when the pan under it is so much larger.-Poor height, this might be wide, but also short, can't or have hard time fitting a whole  large chicken. Small 3lb is good. I did got a 5lb fit, but need to push flat as possible for it to fit. It had about 1cm clearance from the heating element, which is not ideal and it came out dry. The 3lb was still juicy due to more clearance and space for the air to heat it.-So much plastic on the front cover, as it trap water inside after wash.-Because it traps water, after rinsing, when you cook again, there will be steam comes out under or inside the basket (some people have noted this as smoke, but is just steam).-Nasty smell, I don't know what it is, but after 10min of cooking there is a nasty smell, like plastic or non-stick coating. I really don't know what it is, but I would guess is the thick plastic from the front cover. It's still there after weeks of use! ( I also did washed before using it the first time!)-Pre-set options are awful! They always over cook and burn my food. (Unless you are cooking very large or fill whole basket full, don't use the pre-setting!)-The key/touch pad buttons as one of the worst I have use. It either reads your touch to much or don't at all, as other have stated. Mine so falr haven't fail yet.-No dehydrator option, even though it can do it. But since COSORI sells a dehydrator oven they left this option out, other Fryer in the market have this option handy. Final Thought:I only pick this cause it was on sale under $100, and it has smart wifi. The App is handy as it can control the unit if the touch pad does fail one day. Cooking food is great as long you don't use the pre-setting, like cooking frys and pre-cook chicken wings from the freezer does not need 25min, rather a 12min is done! and that's fast. My conventional counter oven would take 15-20min. Food comes out not as crunchy/crispy as some other Fryer I had used.I wish the height of the basket would be taller as another brand I had that was a 6qt was just enough to fit a whole small chicken even though it was only a little less wide as this.Finally the weird smell really kills this review. I just don't know why, I had used my friend's fryer another brand which doesn't have this issue, I really think they over used the cheap plastic cover that's causing it after it heats up, or I could be wrong. This Fryer is, really a ""heat dryer"" as it doesn't fry anything nor it will replace my counter Oven, because it just can't do large item or frozen bun, which best to steam. However, it does cook fast and can keep the juice in the meat, plus reducing the fat. Again it's great with meat and that's about it, everything else is just okay. It's also a bit pricey for something with so many cons, you can find way cheaper Air Fryer this size on sale if not for the smart wifi feature.  Even COSORI's other lower model which is the same size cheaper by 30%.Update 11/2020After months of use, the smell is still there, it has to do with the plastic, the smell is from the top of the unit, anytime I cook over 10min I can start to smell it. Won't find this toxic smell from my counter top oven. I have my windows open and fan on to escape the smell, if not I would of trashed this. Now I'm just waiting for this fryer to fail one day so I can get something else. Otherwise, it still cooks not to bad. They have so far a second firmware update,  don't know what they tried to improve on the unit, wish they would have a history log from app.

  I guess that it didn't ""die"", it just decided be lazy. My guess is a faulty temp sensor or some such malfunction, as it will run for 5 minutes or so, and then shut off until the whole thing cools off again. It literally behaves as it's unplugged.  If I set it to a low temp, like 200 or so, it will work for longer, but what good is that? Unfortunately, it's just out of the return window by a couple of weeks or so, and I had just discarded the original packaging thinking that it was good to go after using it every weekend for a month. I figured that I was out of luck.Cosori Customer service contacted me (see comments) and after sending an email as requested, they shipped me a new one right away. I'm typing this as delicious corn on the cob is frying in it. Yum! They shipped out the new unit quickly via FedEx and it got to me fast! I am very, very satisfied with Cosori.There's going to be a failure rate with everything, even if it's a very small percentage, and great customer service can make up for it. It did with me.

    Way better than my Cuisinart TOA-60 Convection Toaster Air Fryer !!!
  
",5.0,Tom in Oregon,"Reviewed in the United States November 26, 2019","









  
  
    
  When the air fry craze first hit I thought a multi-task unit was for me.  I used the Cuisinart for a year before I decided to buy a dedicated air fryer.  The Cuisinart gave me a great learning experience but it was an awful chore to clean.  Also the heating element consisted of 3 ceramic rods at the top which didn't air fry the whole basket evenly.  I settled on the Cosori after a week of You Tube videos and internet research.  In the 2 days of owning the Cosori I've only been able to fry 2 items:, ie:  chicken wings and this morning - breakfast sausages.  I can tell you that I do not miss the Cuisinart at all.  Reasons for my liking the Cosori are:  Very easy to clean.  The exposed heating element seems to burn off any grease splatter before it hots the fan grid work.  The square pan allows more food in a single layer than a round pan.  The large heating element eliminates any hot/cold spots in the fry basket.  Much smaller footprint than the Cuisinart.  There is a learning curve.  The 2 items I fried were a little too well done for my liking.  The Cosori cooks much faster than the Cuisinart so I will adjust my recipes accordingly.  I am glad that I had a year's air fry experience.  I know how to correct recipe instructions for my liking.  The experience is sufficient to allow me to review the Cosori without prejudice.  Between the Cosori and my Instant Pot I can use my range's oven for storage.

    4 Stars But Its Just Not For Me
  
",4.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  I don’t usually do reviews so I’ll keep it short.First off..this air fryer for the most part was great.  A few coworkers talked me into it so I decided to give it a shot.What I liked:I don’t think there’s anything prepared I did not like. Some of the best fresh fish I’ve ever had. This by far is the one thing that I can say may be worth the purchase alone.... Phenomenal! Potatoes, chicken, the crunch in asparagus and broccoli that I’ve never had before but could definitely get used to. Just a spritz of olive oil and seasoning. Just set and forget. Cook time is short and clean up is easy. Basket capacity is good enough to cook multiple items at a time.What I didn’t like:1.)Some may not consider this an issue but I can’t get over the smell. It’s overwhelming and can last for days.  It’s not a plastic smell that some complain about. That goes away in time. It’s a deep fryer smell that permeates through the house and lingers for days. An issue that others I’ve talked to don’t seem to have with their air fryers. Maybe better air filtration would benefit.2.) I found 2 of the screws in the bottom of the basket after a few uses. This actually didn’t bother me as much as #1.  Just a small phillips head and problem solved.3.)This contradicts one of the reasons I liked this model but...  It’s big. Make sure you have counter space to accommodate. Likely fine for most. Just takes up too much space for me personally.So in summary..I liked it , recommend it and most probably would agree.. but I have to return this one.

    Review updated after my defective unit was replaced for free.
  
",4.0,Joe Tairei,"Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  PROBLEMS FIXED!!!  PLEASE SEE END OF REVIEW FOR UPDATE.I want to love my Cosori air fryer.  I saw it used on a Youtube cooking channel, and so I figured, this must be a pretty mainstream product.  I got it seven months ago and it has become a mainstay in the kitchen, and all but replaced the toaster oven, the frying pan, and even the grill.The one problem I have is that the buttons, or whatever you call those little circles on the front panel, are very difficult to press, especially with damp fingers.  It just doesn't work. What's more, when I press them, they don't activate the function immediately; they seem to work only after my finger is lifted.  A kind of delayed reaction, in other words. I can't understand why they couldn't have used an old fashioned set of push buttons, or even a mechanical dial switch.  These technologies have been around for at least 100 years and are pretty well understood.I have tried and tried to figure out how to use the buttons but they are just persnickety and only work part of the time.  Extremely frustrating and that's why I knocked the rating down from 5 stars to 2.  I'm planning to finally contact them and ask whether I have a defective unit, and if they can somehow fix the problem, I'll be happy to alter this rating.Apart from that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?As a cooking appliance, if you can get past the awful user interface, it's a great cooker.  It can cook 6-8 chicken drumsticks in 24 minutes and they come out absolutely delicious, juicy and tender, not raw in the middle, not burned on the outside.It makes toast reasonably well (though we don't make a lot of toast in this house).  It is great for reheating things.  It is wonderful for vegetables; one of our favorites is broccoli florets sprinkled with hoisin sauce and garlic -- just don't over cook or you get these nasty black bitter bits that are quite unappetizing.There are hundreds of videos out there demonstrating how to make just about anything in these gizmos.  I was an air fryer skeptic until I watched a few, then decided to take the plunge and get one, and now I'm sold... albeit, I wish I'd gotten one that was easier to use.They do make an app that allows you to control the air fryer from your phone.  It's what I would call a work in progress. The name of the app is ""VeSync"".  You run the app and it detects the Cosori as one of the appliances it can control.  That's fine for them, I suppose, but from the user's perspective, it would be so much better to have an app called ""Cosori"".  I have so many apps and it's impossible to remember that vesync means cosori.  Come on, who decided this was a great idea?Anyway, more on the app:  it sort of works well.  I say ""sort of"", because it promises more than it delivers.  There's a ""cooking history"" section (but no search function).  You can tap on a history item and it will start the Cosori for you, remotely; you can also alter the temp and cooking time.  Right now I can see last night's chicken, but it doesn't list this morning's pop tart from 15 minutes ago. WHY??? Maybe it takes a while to retrieve the data... I have no idea.  Just another annoyance.  The app does send you notifications when the cooker is done, if you choose to use that feature.I do like that you can add your own recipes to the app.  The thing is, it's not rocket science to use this fryer; just set time and temperature and go.  The saved recipe thing is mainly to help you not overcook or undercook, and that's a matter of trial and error.As far as cleaning and maintenance, it's pretty simple.  You pull out the basket and wash in warm soapy water.  If you're doing dry stuff like toast or reheating a bowl of soup, there's little or no cleaning.  If you're doing meat or wet veggies, you may need to do some cleaning.  I use a soft scratch sponge, but a brush also works well. It helps to soak the whole basket in warm soapy water for 20 minutes, and my wife has run the inner basket through the dishwasher a couple of times; that makes me nervous that it could damage the teflon coating, but so far it seems okay.The inner/outer basket design has plusses and minuses; you can lift the inner basket out, but if you're doing it one-handed (as one tends to do in kitchens) you need a surface under the outer basket or it will fall to the floor.  Not ideal; it would be nice if the outer basket could be retained in the machine somehow, maybe with a hook, so you don't have to position the air fryer 12"" in from the edge of the counter.Liquid seems to accumulate sometimes in the space under the outer basket, maybe just condensation.  It's probably not a bad idea to wipe that up from time to time, just to prevent rusting or messing up the heat cycle.In my opinion, this appliance is still a work-in-progress. They have some issues to solve regarding the buttons and basket design.  Air fryers in general are still a new thing, but they've become very popular for good reason; they work very well for what they do.  With a few tweaks, this can be an excellent product worthy of 5 stars.UPDATE June 25 2020After I wrote to Cosori, they generously shipped me a new unit.  I'm happy to report that the buttons work much better.  As a test, I wet my finger and it still works.  I will say, the buttons still have a kind of delayed reaction -- they don't really engage until you lift your finger, which is odd, but I have gotten used to it.  Most importantly, the buttons all respond immediately now, and I don't need to repeatedly press the time/temp button to activate it.  Thanks to Cosori for properly handling this issue and I've boosted my rating accordingly.

  Older gent (60+) never cared for having a fryer in the house, never 'deep fried' or 'air fried,' except for attempting to make Mitford Cookbook's ""Louella's Fried Chicken"" in a skillet -if you know, you KNOW... [https://www.amazon.com/Karons-Mitford-Cookbook-Kitchen-Reader/dp/0670032395/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2HNF7KOIKY5CS&dchild=1&keywords=mitford+cookbook+and+kitchen+reader&qid=1590771033&s=books&sprefix=Mitford+Cook%2Cstripbooks%2C167&sr=1-1]And one equally smelly, messy but delicious attempt at making tempura, 'just because,' when the kids were little- thank you, Japanese cartoons of the late 90's! (Gotta catch 'em all.  But, after both those attempts, our common question was, ""where do you put all that old oil, if you don't live in the Upper Midwest, where you can freeze it and throw it the next day or two, when the garbageman comes?"")  Fast forward 15 years. The wife would never have seen the benefit of this device had we 'debated' about whether to buy it or not, except that a serious medical emergency (me) mandated some lifestyle changes on our parts (I'm ok, six months down the road, GsD).After looking at all sorts and sizes of 'air fryers' we (I) chose this model for: a) cost, b) size, c) looks, and d) functionality. Couldn't be happier. We have used it alone, (just the two of us) to make Mustard Chicken skewers (amazingly yum), 'fried' sweet potato fries, regular potato fries, and now that our kids  are home (from college/Covid) they have used it to make 'spicy carrot chips' and 'fried tofu' (daughter 'says' she's now a vegetarian, whatchagonnadoo?)- but I'll admit, those things DID taste good, and no fuss, no mess, NO OIL. Not once.This summer we plan to use it at least two to three times a week, to help free up space in a kitchen with only one stove/cooktop unit... and too many cooks! Clean-up takes all of a minute with soapy water, paper liners that absorb most of the oil; the unit itself heats up quickly, runs as it's supposed to do,  and is relatively quiet. It's effective, and looks fantastic on our counter next to our single-cup Coffee maker (Daughter is hogging that, every morning, too- LOL) and the cookbook that came with it, will give us enough recipes for months to come, as we work on our 'slow and gentle' learning curve.

So, is it the greatest thing since the microwave? -maybe.  But that big/little air fryer is now definitely a part of our cooking lives. Who'd a thunk?

    Perfect air fryer

  I bought this air fryer after seeing the tons of review in Amazon. I was very doubtful that it might be one of those marketing tricks.Tried chicken and spicy fried peanuts.Unbelievable results. Both Cooked to perfection.1lb chicken took only 9mins to cook with 1tsp of oil at 360deg.1lb Raw peanuts + 1 tsp of oil, fried to crisp in 20 mins 320deg. Opened and Stirred every 5mins though.I couldn’t wait to try all the recipes listed in the cook book that came with the unit.I wish manufacturer provided more fixtures like other brands.Super happy with this product.These are the other factors I was worried about before buying1. Noise: I would say half of microwave. Much quieter than my hood at 1 setting.2. Plastic smell: As soon as I received the unit, washed it with soap water. Ran empty cycle for 20 mins. Smelled chemical for first 2 mins.  After that there was no smell at all3. Smoke: There was no smoke at all while cooking chicken.I was super impressed and surprised with the performance.

  I like it that it is easy to use. First, I used it for fries. It says to preheat for better and faster cooking results. The thing that I did not like was the fact that every time I preheat or just started cooking, it will always smoke up inside my house. My purpose in buying this was for easy cooking and cleaning indoor. I took it outside and tried cooking bacon and chicken eith the pre-set setting on the menu display and it cooked well. The tray is easy to clean but the air fryer itself inside wasn't easy to clean.

    Major problems that are potentially dangerous!
  
",2.0,M. Reid,"Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2020","









  
  
    
  Sooo I’ve been using my Cosori Air Fryer about two months now. One day I was using it to cook up a few turkey burgers for the kids and out of nowhere, and in the middle of cooking, the basket released itself from the fryer, slid out onto the countertop and since I have granite countertops, it kept sliding right off that surface and crashed to the floor. Very random! I was thinking I’d done something wrong. This device has to be perfect right? I mean it wasn’t exactly cheap. I’d done my homework and got one of the top rated. Maybe I didn’t lock it into place all the way. So from that point, I’d made it my business to be sure to push it in all the way until I felt it lock. All was all good for about 3 weeks and then this afternoon, I was making lunch for me and hubby. I’d put in two Burgers and was preparing us a salad when 5 minutes into the cooking process, I heard the fan stop and I turned around quickly but I was too late, the basket popped out, slid onto the countertop and then crashed to the floor. But this time, hot splatter popped onto my foot and leg...OUCH! I wasn’t badly injured but I’m baffled!!! Literally baffled! This is obviously a flaw in the design that can be potentially dangerous. Imagine if my kid was in there??? Realistically, I love this fryer! I love the design, I love ease of use and ease of cleaning and I love the way the food tastes when it comes out. But that right there, that’s BAD! One other issue...there are about 5 small screws inside that loosen on their own so I find myself tightening them at least twice a week. And lastly, don’t ever and I mean EVER hit the button that releases the basket from the tray unless you are holding it over a countertop or something. I made that mistake and the entire tray dropped out and fell on my foot. It wasn’t hot but it hurt like hell!!!Update: I contacted Cosori directly after my blackened mahi ended up all over my kitchen floor. They need to be aware of this problem. At first I was quite offended that one of the reps told me, “We will look into this issue immediately. Meanwhile, take a moment to read your Cosori Air Fryer manual!” What???!!! So you mean to tell me there is a portion of the manual that mentions this malfunction??? Because I already read the manual and it was never mentioned! Anywho....they handled the situation for me and offered to replace my current air fryer and asked me to ship them the old one so that they could investigate this. So I’m feeling that this may not be a common problem as I’ve only found a few videos of people complaining about this same malfunction (which apparently becomes progressively worse). So as of today, a new fryer has been sent and is on the way. Hoping I don’t have these problems again.

    Handle falls off the basket after four months of use
  
",3.0,Larry,"Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2019","









  
  
    
  My wife and I love this 5.8 qt air fryer. I was never much of a cook until we bought this fryer. Now I cook wings, sausages, and lots of other things in it. In fact, I cooked so much that I have now worn out the basket handle after four months of use. Two out of three screws that hold it together came out, and the handle just flops around. I managed to find one of the screws in the sink drain just after it fell out and before the disposal ruined it. However, the second one is nowhere to be found. Fortunately, the handle will kinda work with just two screws holding it together, but the whole thing feels less secure than it did with three screws. I have ordered a couple of spare baskets so I can keep using the fryer, but I am not happy with paying $25 a pop for a manufacturing issue. The screws should have been mounted so they would not back out under normal use and washing.

I have to unplug to turn it off almost every single time. I want to return it and buy one with a knob. So frustrating!!Edited to add: Cosori customer service is top notch! They are replacing my air fryer with a dial version (the one I wanted) and are refunding me the difference between the two models. They told me to keep the old one to use as spare parts if needed.

  I am blown away with the food results. I love it's ease of use. It looks great. Holds a decent amount of food. Very fast. 99% of it I love.HOWEVER, I bought this as A Christmas gift. It's early February at the time of writing this. While handwashing the basket a week ago, i started scrubbing (with a cloth rag) what i thought was baked on food. Upon closer inspection, i realized that the nonstick coating was gelling up and easily peeling off with the lightest pressure. I'm pretty pissed. I'm actually nervous about frying food in it now due to the known risks of PTFE. Perhaps the stainless version would've been a better choice.

  I had a connectivity (WiFi) issue after I moved to my new apartment.As I could not connect the Air Fryer to the same WiFi, I contacted their support to try helping me figure it out.Tia, from the support team, kept in touch for around three weeks trying to help me with this, putting a lot of effort and dedication to solve my problem. They tried everything until they decided to send me a brand new Air Fryer to make sure it was a hardware problem.When the new Air Fryer arrived, Tia notified me that their team kept investigating and they wanted me to try a different thing, which then worked! So, the problem was with my new Internet Service Provider connection, not with the Air Fryer itself.I cannot express how impressed I was with Tia's and the support team's dedication to solve a customer problem. They also sent me a prize for being patient as a customer for that long.They've got all my patience because I could see how passionate they were to have their customer's problems solved. Also, as I worked on a remote support team in the past, I know how difficult it is to troubleshoot and solve problems remotely, with no access to the customer's environment.Congratulations on the great product and great, amazing post sale support.

  Sorry, I'm not on the 5 star review bandwagon here.  It cooks well, but it's literally a burner coil with a fan that circulates air.  You're not going to find one hot fan that adds more flavor than another.  I wish I had done more research and bought something else instead.First off, it's LOUD!  We have a smaller house with an open concept kitchen/dining/living area.  When this is going it's totally disruptive to watching TV, kids doing homework, listening to music, etc...WiFi...why did I pay extra for this?  I never use it.  I can't think of a practical reason for it.  I get random notifications when I'm at work that my wife is cooking stuff in the air fryer.The buttons are hard to use.  They don't always register that I touch them more often than not.  The presets are useless.  They give you a general idea of temp and cook time, but you cannot blindly trust them.It's HUGE!  Despite it's huge size you'll find yourself limited in cooking space.  For 4 adults I have to cook fries or tots in 2 batches.Construction seems cheap.  The screws that hold the handle on are inside the basket.  One of them fell into the cooking basket and ended up in my mouth, the other two were extremely loose.If you're looking for one, look for something a little more basic.  A simple time/temp knob is all that's needed.  Look for something a little more quiet if you're cooking near your living area.  Save your money on fancy feature, you won't find yourself using them.

   I have used this air fryer a lot over the past half a year. At first, I wondered if Air Fryers were worth the hype, and I can attest to the fact that they are. I loved this thing for the first couple months, recommended it to friends who went and bought it too. Now, as much as I want to be loyal and keep the brand, find myself worried about longevity.I don't know if I would consider this air fryer to be expensive, because with as much as we use it, it is worth every penny and is about the price of a mid-range microwave. But it was a purchase I didn't have a lot of excess money for and I was bummed it hasn't lasted six months. It doesn't appear cheaply made so I wonder if I have a lemon or something.So let me jump into the issues I have after many, many uses. The worst is that the air fryer drawer pops open sometimes while cooking... almost shoots out a foot or more, clear out of the fryer itself. It had issues remaining shut previously, with steam coming out the bottom sides. I remedied that by firmly pushing it back in again and it typically ""sealed"" up. Now it just pops completely out of the unit onto the counter.Up until that point, the only thing I disliked is the touch screen interface it uses for programming time, temperature etc. It is finicky and doesn't always register a finger-press... sometimes pressing more than a few times to get it to register. Sometimes it will not register prints at all.So, I'm unsure if I got the lemon of the bunch, and I really want to love this air fryer. I still use it... just with caution and while I am around.

  I don't typically write reviews but I love this thing. So first the disclaimer... this review is for the parents because well that's me.What I love:The wifi connection with the app- when I saw this feature my first thought was who would need this much gadgetry come on. But then there's the fact you can preheat it before u get home so it's ready or I can start it and walk away and get alerts that hey I have something cooking. You don't think it's a big thing but once you use it your like man I wish every appliance reminded me I was doing something.The basket-some reviews complained about the plastic piece and feeling flimsy or that the basket came apart too easy. That clear plastic piece covers a button. You have to slide that piece all the way up which can only be done when you have the basket out. Then you have to push the button all the way down and that releases the basket which you still have to pull out. Again that's my experience... I know things happen but that's how I worked for me. Plus the thing is huge. I easily feed my family of 3 or 4 when friends are over.The food-there is a learning curve with already prepared food like chicken nuggets or French fries from a bag. Yes I cook that stuff because I have kids and am comparable to their favorite restaurants now with this thing! I have learned to cut the cooking time in half and that's pretty accurate. The app has a ton of recipes too that are super easy for parents and not too gourmet. I do cook things that aren't in a bag and they come out amazing.I read reviews for this item and about 20 other ones. This one looked good on paper but then some of the reviews gave me concerns so I waited a month to purchase it. I'm sure there are flukes and things go wrong but for my experience it was as good as it is on paper. From a single mom point of view who has very little free time... This thing rocks!

  This is my first air fryer so I am totally amazed with the technology.  Instant, perfect results.  I was contemplating a new toaster oven when I got this, but one week later I unplugged the toaster oven to be replaced with my Cosori air fryer! It makes breakfast bagel sandwiches to rival Panera ... toast the bagel, fry the egg, and grill up sausage in the Cosori ... and cleanup is wiping out two baskets.  Hash browns, fries and onion rings brown to perfection ... way crispier than deep fry.  Corned beef hash cooks up great.  Turkey burgers from frozen to grilled in 12 minutes, and the bread toasts up in the same pan.  Fried chicken is wonderful with panko bread crumbs.  Hot dogs are perfectly grilled and buns are toasted to perfection.  I chose the Cosori based on customer reviews on Amazon but I checked out other brands in stores and none meet Cosori quality.  If you are new to air frying like me, an instant read thermometer is a must and something to lift dishes and pans out of the basket is good.  I use a lifter that came with a Insta Pot accessory set.  I found most of my cookware works fine .. that is, if it fits in the basket.  This air fryer has improved the way I toast, grill, bake and fry.  It's a popular cooking trend, you can Google any recioe you want online .... ""How do you make a baked apple in an air fryer?""

A bit disappointed for the inconvenience I have to go through in returning it. I went on and ordered a replacement, I guess things happen. Just a bit of disappointing if it is new? the face seemed it had hairlines swirls, not sure if it was a return. All looked new. Will update once I get a working unit.********UPDATE********Ok, I received my replacement order Monday, Thank you Amazon! This is a night and day product compared to what I received before.

First, the external box was an ""Amazon"" badged box and smaller over all. 2nd, the box inside was a ""Cosori"" labeled box compared to what I had before (Leit or something like that). Third, the box inside the Cosori box was the actual box of the product (with all the pics of it). Lastly the big difference was the fact that the basket had tape holding the basket as many ""new"" products are done. All looked great, plus no Swirls on the face. A new product indeed. I have a feeling the first was a return. Not cool.Now for the product review.. Yesterday, I went crazy and cooked Battered frozen strips for kids and they were Crispy using the frozen option. Wow!  Also, cooked fresh cut fries came out awesome. I think I cut them to thin, but the bigger ones were crispy and no oil (except for olive oil per instructions). Lastly last night, a NY and it was perfectly cooked, a nice Med Rare, it was great. Today, was another test. My daughter and I, mostly her cooked the Jalapeño popper from recipe book. They were great, only think I would of added to recipe was cream cheese, but followed directions for first time. Lastly, I cooked two giant chicken breast. I cooked then at 360 per online instructions, but I think the chicken preset would of done it just fine. Flipped them twice. Perfectly cooked at about 25-30 min.at 360. The president et is for 390 for 25.Wish I took pics, but let me tell you, this Air fryer is awesome. Don't doubt yourself in purchasing. You will be happy with results. I research and went with this brand, plus you sign up for warranty they give you an extra year for free. Cant beat that deal!

  I just finished making the most amazing batch of buffalo-style wings in our new Cosori air fryer.  Honestly, about the best I've ever had.  It is easy to use, easy to clean, and has earned a permanent spot on our kitchen counter.  It re-heats food like it was made fresh (think pizza etc.), doesn't require an oven preheat, no oil.Now, the customer support part.  We ordered this online and used it first for some fried chicken.  it was delicious, but it behaved a little strangely - would suddenly cut out for a few seconds, and then come back on.  I thought that's weird, but maybe that's what it's supposed to do?  Anyway, it got worse and eventually stopped working after the 4th or 5th use.  By this time it was too late to return to Amazon so I contacted customer support via their website chat.Within about 10 minutes we had a new one on the way, no charge, no return required, and 4 days later we received the properly functioning we have now.  I wanted to wait until we got the new one to check out before I reviewed.THAT's how customer service is supposed to work when things go wrong.  You back up your product when something's not right.  So kudos to Cosori for a really great kitchen appliance, and triple kudos for their customer support.I would not hesitate to buy another anything from Cosori.

  Definitely don’t buy a smart air fryer if you don’t need it; this is an unnecessary purchase but if you’re willing to splurge 80 bucks for something that’ll help you cook in the kitchen this is ideal.I’m not the best chef in the world, in fact, I think the worst part of cooking is how long it takes and having to sit in a hot kitchen for hours. This air fryer is so quick and easy and it notifies your phone so you don’t have to sit in the kitchen or wait on it not to burn. You can go about your day and it will let you know when your food is ready. And you’ll really have to play around with the settings. The presets are really good guideline but you’ll have to take it upon yourself to really cook certain dishes properly.Now the main setback I have is actually cleaning it. I don’t have a dishwasher so I have to hand wash it myself and if I cook with oil or anything that stains even when I use parchment paper and foil all of that gunk sticks to the slits in the side of the basket. I would let it soak in Ajax and dish soap and come back scrub it out and it would still be dried grease stuck in between the cracks. This thing is almost impossible to clean entirely after the first use without a dishwasher.Another con would be cooking fries in this is not ideal; Frankly like all air fryers all fries come out super dry and dehydrated. Since many air fryers do this I’m not faulting this brand specifically, however I couldn’t help but mention it.

  So, ive had two of these both had touch display issues. The 1st the touch screen didnt respond unless you like wipe your hand across the display then random buttons would activate, however when u touch those buttons (lite, firm & hulk smashing) didnt respond. Power button wouldnt respond at all. However it worked via app n with Alexa. 2nd one responded to touch for most of the display, power worked but the manual temp n time touch buttons would work intermittently. Sometimes lite pressure worked, one time holding your finger for like 15sec activated it but not the follow-up attempts, hulk smash finger press worked but none of those worked consistently.  Returned both went with ninja. This was top rated n bunch of good reviews n cheaper then the ninja. After some googling found this is a known and common issue, so much so that i called the manufacture n after describing what was happened just offered to replace it, no try this or that just okay we will send u a new one but it would take upto 10business days. Returned thru amazon quick and easy. The features it has if touch display works would b a awesome machine. However if your touch display does work then setup to the app (once downloaded) was easy, setup with alexa (once skill for fryer app enabled via alexa app) was easy n part of setup process. It responded to the app n alexa no issues. I loved the features plus having the wireless abilities thats why i opted for a 2nd to see if just a bum machine which happens but 2 for 2 pretty much same issue moved on. Gave 2 stars just due to fact it semi-worked but not everyone has alexa or wants to use an app (mom hates using both). So id say buy it see if you get a working machine if not move on!

    Great appliance  if you have the space and understand this isn’t a true fryer
  
",4.0,thoughtful consumer,"Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2019","









  
  
    
  I’ve had this Air Fryer for about a week, and so far it hasn’t disappointed. I like the square basket-I think it fits food better. I was able to easily fit 6 chicken tenders with room for at least 2-3 more. Cleaning the basket (and the base that the basket rests in) has been very easy, but I do use a soft-bristle kitchen brush on a long handle to get into all the openings in the basket. The air fryer is big and does take up counter space, but it’s not heavy to move around. I keep it on my rolling kitchen cart and move it to my counter to use it. I do rest it on a large, wooden cutting board when using just in case the bottom gets warm. The instructions are easy to understand, and using the control panel is fairly intuitive. I haven’t used the pre-settings. I prefer to set my own temperature and time. The vent in the back releases hot air when in use. I was able to put my hand about two inches from the vent without difficulty. Still, I give about 5” of space on all sides just to be safe. I didn’t find it too loud. I mean, it circulates hot air with a fan so there’s going to be some noise, but It didn’t annoy me.So far I’ve made French fries with russet potatoes, a chocolate cake (see photo) and chicken tenders (homemade, not frozen. See photo). All three items turned out delicious. The cake was divine-especially the second day (I have no idea why). The chicken tenders were crunchy on the outside and not the least bit dry on the inside. The fries would have been over-cooked had I left them in for the full amount of time the recipe called for. They were crisp on the outside. The cake recipe stated 30 minutes at 330 degrees. My attempt took 55 minutes at 330 degrees. I wasn’t surprised by this. I thought 30 minutes seemed too short. My advice is, check your food often at first to get a feel for the fryer. This is really no different than getting used to a new oven or other cooking appliance. You need to play around with times and temperatures a bit. Also, get a good air fryer cookbook or some highly-rated recipes online.Pros:-Easy to use, intuitive-easy clean up-keeps kitchen cool in summer-don’t have to heat up your oven for a small amount of food-1 to 2 minutes to preheat or no preheating for some recipes-Large basket, and square shape seems to fit food very well-basket has a safety feature so you won’t accidentally release it from the base it sits in-much healthier than deep fried foods, but you can still get that crispy crunchinessCons:-It’s large. You will lose counter space unless you can store it somewhere and take it out when needed.-if you are cooking for a large group, you’re going to be cooking in batches. The basket size works fine for our family of three with two light eaters, but even one more person at the table would have me cooking in batches.-If your looking for something to give you the same, exact taste as genuine fried food, this isn’t for you. It’s not an actual fryer. The name is deceiving. It’s really a countertop convection oven. The recipes use minimal oil (1 Tbsp for the fries I made and several sprays of olive oil on the chicken tenders with an olive oil spritzer).I would recommend this model so far without hesitation, but it’s only been one week and three recipes. If anything changes, I’ll update my review. I hope this helps you make a decision.

This Air Fryer cooks everything like a dream-beef tenderloin comes out perfect from medium on the ends to medium rare throughout the middle. Pork, Beef, Chicken, Lamb, Fish, Roasted Vegetables, hard boiled eggs, frozen foods-you name it. In fact I am thinking about purchasing a 2nd Air fryer so I can do my meat and veggies at the same time.  I highly recommend this model.We received our Air Fryer a few days ago and we are really happy with it.  We've made a blooming onion (80% fewer calories than old recipe), chicken wings, chicken tenders and tonight we will make a roast chicken, with roasted corn and sweet potato fries.  This Air Fryer is very easy to use, and very easy to clean.  I purchased after doing much research on many different models-finally decided on this one based on Amazon reviews, and again-we are very happy so far.  Motivation to purchase derived from being on Weight Watchers and wanting to experience that ""deep fried"" goodness without all the fat--and boy this is the way to do it.  I highly recommend this unit.

  We bought the Cosori airfryer seven months ago as a replacement for a cheap but sturdy one we used for 3 years (heavy users), and now we're getting a new one because it makes us nervous. Despite that, I'm still giving this fryer three stars, because it executes its core function really well despite its quirks.The good/great:Fantastic air-frying capabilities - the crispy outside to juicy inside ratio is always perfect or near to it and cooks pretty evenly even when we're too lazy to flip items. Makes beautiful fries.Great cooking area - the shape makes for a good surface to put lots of itemsVery easy to clean - cleans well in the dishwasher as well as by hand. Easy to wipe up mess.Pleasing design - I like it's square, shiny red finishEasy to operateThe bad/why we're replacing it 7 months in:It blows out of fuses. This has happened several times, and the main reason we're getting rid of it - it's blown out fuses on its own and when other appliances are on the same circuit; our wiring is pretty sturdy, so it's disturbing.It's falling apart. From the beginning the basket and the basket tray sorta rattled a bit, and what they've been doing over time is undoing the screws. We tightened it but one went missing (maybe in the dishwasher?) and there's two holding on for dear life; we're constantly having to tighten it. It seems to simply be a side effect of how its built.The tray sometimes rattles itself out of place and stops cooking - the tray sometimes rattles itself out and will stop the cooking process; probably a bit of operator error, howeverI would have definitely given this machine 5 stars when I first got it, but it unfortunately hasn't held up very well.

  So, I've had this for almost four months. Overall I'm very pleased with the air fryer. I use it almost daily. I've made chicken, corn, eggplant, fries (of course), spaghetti squash, meat balls and more and everything comes out amazing, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. There are however a few design flaws that need to be addressed by the company. One is major. The screws in both baskets become loose after almost every use and I constantly have to tighten them. I discovered this when I found one of the screws in my food! The other issue, is that the material of the inner basket (with the holes), is different than the material of the drip basket. The drip basket is a non-stick material that is very easy to clean. The basket with the holes (roasting basket thing) does not appear to be. The first few times of use, it was easy to clean and with each subsequent  use, it becomes more and more difficult. I use a variety of cooking sprays when using the fryer and eventually the basket ends up with a sticky, oily residue that is impossible to remove unless you use an abrasive scouring tool, which would obviously ruin the basket, so I haven't done that and try to ignore the fact that I'm cooking in a pan that is less than clean. Just FYI, I clean both baskets after each use. I hope you find this helpful.

  This is a pretty good air fryer. I knocked a star off because I think its a bit expensive for a brand I've never heard of. Otherwise, I've cooked pork, fish, brussel sprouts, fries, all sorts of things in it and it works well. Size-wise, I can easily fit two mackerels in it - three very crowded. Food turns out well. I was afraid it would be another kitchen gadget I would buy, use a few times, and end up cluttering the countertop, but I have used it at least once a week, for the past few months. Cooking fish (especially mackerel) can be stinky, but I just put this gadget right over the stovetop, turn on the stovetop ventilation, and it is the easiest, cleanest, least-stinky way of cooking fish.

  A reasonable air fryer, it is very easy to use and produces reasonable air fried food. It can be somewhat tough to clean, but I imagine this is a problem with just about any air fryer. The non-stick coating is wearing off in a few places because of how the machine is designed and the basket is supported, but this isn't a deal-breaker.I wish I could disable the beeps, but I understand this isn't a ubiquitous feature yet, so it's OK.The biggest problem is the durability. I used this machine moderately for 1 year -- maybe once per week. I was always gentle with it, never abused it. Really fair use. But after just over 1 year of use the handle cracked off, rendering the fryer useless. $120/yr is a lot to pay for an air fryer. I urge you to find another option.

  UPDATE:  I initially rated this 5-starts.  I am sorry that I need to update the review.  The air fryer is not consistently recognizing when the basket is inserted.  While doing a 40 minute cook, it turned off after 7 minutes thinking the basket was not present.  I have had problems with this before but this time jiggling the basket would not resolve the problem.  I had to resort to using  a kitchen knife to get the fryer to recognize that the basket was installed (see photo).I have also had issues with the touch panel not recognizing when a button is pushed but that wasn't a problem as I could use my iPhone and the WIFI connection to set the temp, time, etc.Original Review:I highly recommend the WiFi version of the Cosori 5.8 quart air fryer.  We have had ours for the less than a month and use it almost daily while we try out new recipes.The iPhone app connects with the Cosori Smart WIFi air fryer.  You can select a recipe illustrated in the app or you can manually set the time and temperature and start cooking.  The app updates you on the progress of the cooking -- how many minutes are left, when to shake, when cooking is done.If the air fryer did not have the WiFi feature, I would have returned the air fryer because the buttons for manually changing cooking time and temperature on the fryer are difficult to use.  The time and temperature buttons on  don't always register when you push them.  This is NOT a problem if you have a smart phone and purchase the WiFi enabled air fryer.I have recommended this air fryer to several family members.

",2.0,E. B.,"Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is my second unit so these issues aren't with my air fryer only.  I sent my first one back thinking I must have had a defective unit.First-  The screws in the basket WILL fall out frequently.  They will fall into your food.  You will need to check and tighten them frequently or you risk choking on the screws.  I'm not sure how they can even continue to sell this like with this problem.  The screws on the outer portion (the basket holder) will come out too but not as frequently.Second-The timer resets everytime you 'shake'.  Those who have air fryers know you are to pull out the tray and shake it around while cooking to maximize air flow and crispiness.  Air fryers will continue right where you left off when you put the basket back in-that's one of air fryers biggest conveniences.  The problem with this one is it resets back to a full minute each time you do that.  For example, say you are cooking something for 15 minutes and you 'shake' 5 times.  If you pull the basket out and there's 12:02 left when you put it back in it starts back at 12:59 seconds.  After 5 times you might be adding around 4-5 minutes extra cooking time.Third-The least of the problems but still a problem.  The buttons are really weird on the front and you have to almost press through the panel to get them to work.  It was worse on my first one.Other than the big problems the air fryer is awesome.  I love the shape of the basket and the way the basket is designed to maximize air flow.

  My halogen convection air fryer finally died and after a little research I decided to purchase the Cosori 5.8 WiFi Air Fryer.Set up was a breeze and the AF worked really well. Clean-up is fast and easy. I used the WiFi connection via my phone and the Vesync App to control the AF. But when I tried to use the actual touch pad on the AF to control the cooking the Time/Temp button did not function properly. Sometimes it would work and more often than not it didn't work at all. That meant I could not adjust the cooking time or cooking temperature manually. Amazon did a quick exchange and sent me a new AF promptly. Cudos and thanks to Amazon. No down time. When I received the new unit first thing I did was check the touch pad for function and it worked fine. Fast forward to the 2nd time I used the AF and the Time/Temp button was malfunctioning again. The problem is not as bad as before but there is still a problem. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. There is a Cosori Air fryer group on FB and more than a few people have indicated that they have had the same problem with the touch pad on their WiFi models. I did not see any posts indicating problems with the non-WiFi models. So, not sure what do now: on my 2nd AF and undecided whether to keep it and use the Vesync app or exchange it for the non-WiFi model. My hope is that Cosori will find and correct the issue with a firmware update. If you are thinking about getting a Cosori AF I would definitely recommend the non-WiFi model. Also, I recommend the 5.8 size and you may want to shop for some accessories like wire racks to place inside the AF basket for multi-level cooking. All things considered I think it is still a good AF. If you want help, inspiration or cooking ideas check out the Cosori Air Fryer group on FB.Update: Received 2nd Cosori Smart Air Fryer and Temp/Time button still does not function properly. Have to use WiFi App to control cooking.

  The machine looks good and looks easy to clean.HOWEVER, the the machine makes very strong burning plastic smell in the first several runs we experienced. The smell makes the entire family headache and did not go away after tried 3 times.. the temp we run is not high.. we run 350F and 380F but all times the smell is very strong and penetrates the food.Certain reviews said that the smell will ""go away"" after several use but it should not be there at the very beginning because this is something processing things we put in our mouth at where we live.Not recommend.

  I've been wanting an air fryer for awhile. Mostly to make crispy pork belly in half the time without heating my entire kitchen up from the oven. My brother got the Cosori a few months before me, so I figured I'd get the same so that we could try things out and make sure our temps were consistent since air fryers vary. I love this air fryer. The buttons are easy to use. I like the pre-sets. I like the shake reminders. I like the overall size as well as the size of the basket. I've made cornish hens, a whole chicken, spareribs, french fries, kabobs and yes... I've made the crispy pork belly! Customer service is great and they've got a group on Facebook with more recipes and lots of sharing from other Cosori owners.

    Great Air Fryer + Appropriate Recipes = Good Food
  
",5.0,Owba,"Reviewed in the United States February 27, 2021","









  
  
    
  We purchased the Cosori Air Fryer (the one with the App, though we don't use the App very often so far) for Christmas, mostly because we had Amazon gift cards that we haven't used in several years. We have had no problems with the air fryer so far. The touchscreen is pretty easy to figure out (the User Guide helps as well, of course) and responds from especially light touches. Cleaning is surprisingly easy: we wait until it's cool (roughly 10 minutes) then put in the sink, fill with hot water and a squirt of Dawn, wait until we've finished eating, then wipe with a soft rag or sponge and rinse. Done.Now, about recipes. You can find a stunning amount of recipes on the web, even recipes specific to the Cosori; HOWEVER, our experience is that we have to test recipes until we get results we like. This is where we think air fryers really shine. You can always adjust the temperature and/or cook for a couple of minutes longer, so we check it every 5 minutes or so. For example, we tried English Muffin Pizzas and had to cook them twice as long as the recipe called for. Same for Parmesan Red Potatoes. Chicken Tenders took 2 minutes less than the recipe called for. So it's best to assume you will have to tinker with time/temperature rather than count on the recipe being perfect first time every time.We found Fabulessly Frugal (on YouTube) to be a pretty reliable source for Air Fryer info, especially since the host has a Cosori 5.8oz and she is very good about giving clear instructions ... and because we like her sense of humor. Worth a quick search.

  Update #2 July 2020:  I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY REFUND AS PROMISED BY COSORI.  At this point I would give zero stars if that were possible.Thank you to the Customer Support Team at Cosori for their help in diagnosing my touchpad issues.  Apparently I got a defective one, and they are issuing a refund so I can purchase another.  (I am beyond Amazon's 30 day return window.)This air fryer has a nice, large basket, so I rarely need to cook things in batches. I love the presets and wifi connection, which makes cooking easier.  I can monitor the cooking process on my smartphone.  However, I find that the ""buttons"" do not always respond to touch, especially when I want to increase or decrease the time/temp.  The touch pad just doesn't work!  Don't know if I am doing something wrong or if the devices is not working properly.

  We had heard great things and read some good reviews and I decided to try an air fryer. After looking around it seemed that Cosori has a decent reputation for support and that their non-stick has a good rep for not de-laminating. Enter a good sale and I purchased one.I think we have had it a little over a month and it has been used anywhere from once to four times  a day. We cook a range of stuff from garlic bread to fried chicken,  vegetables, fish sticks, hot dogs, fish, beef, french fries etc. in it.I gave up eating fried chicken a few years ago. My digestive tract isn't as friendly to greasy foods as it once was. I grew up in the south and fried chicken was a staple at my grandmothers house and my mom made it a lot also. When I left home I made it though not as often as I get irritated cleaning the spattered grease up. Finally with the digestive change it left my menu but I really missed it. Now it is back on the menu. I cook chicken a couple times a week now at least and it is great.for better than my mom's or grandmothers breaded fried chicken I take oil of choice and rub a light layer onto a couple large chicken breasts, sprinkle with salt and pepper (or other seasoning of choice) and then sift a heavy layer of flour and pat it in. (I can no longer eat wheat so use rice or oat flour and it is absolutely wonderful.) Place the chicken in the air fryer and just use the stock setting for chicken. It is crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. If you cut the chicken up into smaller portions you probably want to reduce the cooking time from 25 min to maybe 15 to 20.. you'll have to get a feel for it.French fries took a few tries get right.. fresh vs frozen are two different ways of cooking. Fresh use the recommended setting depending on how thick.. if thinner then reduce time a little maybe. frozen you need to reduce time by about a 1/3.Fish sticks such as gortons frozen I use the chicken setting but reduce it to about 20 minutes.. they are lightly crunchy on the outside and moist and tender inside. other brands with thinner fish sticks need reduced cooking time so that they dont dry out.sausage dogs I use the chicken setting with about 18 minutes to get a bit of blackening and cracking of the skin going. For just cooked but not till the skin breaks probably 13 min maybe.anyways it is up there with our rice cooker and electric pressure cooker for devices we use a lot.

  This air fryer has a very large basket. I easily fit in 15 chicken wings, single layer. They are, by far, the best wings I've ever had! It does a great job with frozen french fries, too. With the frozen french fries, there is a fair amount of condensation that comes out the bottom of the air fryer. Not a big deal, but still added wiping up. Fortunately, the air fryer is super easy to clean. Nothing sticks to it! Spray and a little suds and you are done. The only complaint I have is that it still produces a ""plastic"" odor while being used. I am hoping that goes away over time. I am still getting used to using the air fryer and putting it into my weekly routine. I recommend this air fryer to all the skeptics out there.

  I got this fryer against my wife's wishes (she wanted to wait for a sales event), so I really really wanted to like this machine (else I'm in for a continual litany of ""I told you so"").  The fryer was working fine for the first few days; it was easy to use with plenty of button options, the recipe book was helpful, it was a quiet machine, big enough to cook up pork chops, fries, vegetables, etc.  Unfortunately, on the 4th day, while trying to make fries again, it died.  Power was not getting to the machine.  I swapped it around to different outlets in and out of the kitchen, hoping that it was actually my home electrical system (that's how much I wanted this machine to work).  Alas, it was not my electrical system, it was the fryer.  I tried it again the next day, the same issue, it worked for a few minutes, then died.  So, I had to wrap it back up into the box and return it.  Worst yet, I'm now listening to ""I told you so"" from my wife - and we are not allowed to get another fryer until she sees the sale she wants.

  Alright.... First the positive.... The food tastes amazing. When it works properly you'll love it. It has a large basket compared to other so you can cook a decent volume of food too. Now for the reality check.... The screen buttons work about 15% of the time... Almost useless. It forces you to use the app... Which works great until it doesn't work anymore... I bought this and I'm ready to replace it 6 months later. Look for something that is higher quality and easy to use... The malfunctioning screen and app are enough to make you pull your hair out.

    Malfunctioned after only 1 year of use
  
",1.0,Beth,"Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  As my first air fryer, I was very excited when I started learning the “ins” and “outs” of this thing. I am a stay at home mom of three that babysits so it’s important to have food fast when littles are hungry. This was definitely the answer! BUT...After a year of use I realized how extremely difficult it was becoming to clean. I would scrub and scrub after each use and it would still hold this terrible greasy feeling. Everyone assured me it was normal and our food still tasted great, so I considered it only a minor set back.Then one day while cooking lunch, I had put fries in the basket. I set the fries setting and had already shook the basket. (The setting gives you a warning to “shake” halfway through your desired time/temperature.)A few moments passed when I noticed the screen started malfunctioning. The back of the machine started smoking and I immediately unplugged the item from the wall as quickly as possible. After letting it cool down I opened the basket to inspect. Fries were still slightly cold inside, but it looked like a French fry had fallen out of the basket and was stuck between the inside of the machine and the basket. I’m assuming it was laying on just the right spot to fry the machine (and the fry! Because it was black!) Had I not been nearby, we may have just had a house fire! I counted my blessings and the machine went in the garbage! I upgraded to a Ninja Foodi and am so thankful their basket system is not made the same! While I miss my handle.. I use tongs to “flip” and I feel it’s much safer.

  I’ve run this thing for hours now trying to get the awful plastic smell out. After using it in my kitchen for 20 minutes and getting that nasty smell all through my house I spent the day today running it outside on my porch and then cleaning it with hot soapy water. Rinse and repeat. Hours. Food still taste of plastic. And now so does my porch. I can’t see that I’ll ever be able to use it so I consider it a waste of $130. And don’t believe the manufacturer responses in here that says there’s no way the plastic smell is getting into the food. It does, and has continued to do so all day, after hours and hours.I admit that I’m a bit sensitive to smells, but from the reviews on here I’m not the only one. Before you order, if you think you might be one of those people, don’t ignore the warning reviews on here like I did. Save yourself some money and don’t bother.

  I purchased this unit after internet research on reviews of the best units. This one is rated by many sites as the best of the best. Now that I've had mine for a few weeks, and have used it daily, I am very pleased with my purchase. Most of today's kitchen appliances have presets that are actually quite hard to figure out. But not on this unit. The preset choices are extremely easy to use. The temp/time menu is so simple that even this old man can do it without getting confused. The basket is square, which gives it a bigger capacity for more food than a round one. It has a higher power rating than many others, so it cooks fast and thoroughly. To clean it, all I do is put the basket in the dishwasher. That's it. Nothing else. I have a cabin where I spend half my days. So after I bought my first one for the house and used it for a week, I knew I needed one at the cabin too. So I bought a second, identical one. That way I can cook in it pretty much every single day. This is the best kitchen gadget I've purchased in years.

  Love this air fryer. We had the Power xl air fryer in the 3 qt model and the 5 qt model. We used the Power Xl on a daily basis but began to have trouble with the switch located at the bottom where you put the basket in early on. You had to put the basket in and sort of jiggle it to get it to toggle the switch on to allow the air fryer to operate. Eventually, that stopped working and the power xl would no longer turn on. So, it was time to replace it.  The Cosori Air Fryer Max XL does not have this problem. There is no switch at the bottom. The basket slides in easily without having to maneuver it to catch the switch.  I believe it does a better job air frying than the Power Xl.  The preset cooking times and temperatures are great. It is easy to change time and temperatures and it has a pause feature.  The basket handle is sturdy and locks into place easily.  It is non stick and easy to clean.  I like the design of the square basket, it can easily fit a 5 lb chicken. It is easy to use and does a better job than the power Xl.  Wish I would have bought  this one to begin with.  If you are looking for an air fryer this is the one.

  I had the Airfryer XL for years and I told everyone I came in contact with that it was the best thing since microwaves and ovens, and that I would take it to my grave because I loved it so much, lol. Having said that, I have ceramic tile floors and I dropped it 20 or more times (anyone who has that type of floor knows it is rare for anything to survive such a fall, but the XL hanged on). Over time the XL became so banged up that I decided once I move I would re-purchase it. However, after moving, Amazon was having a sale and my pocketbook was tugging at me to make a change. ""I could always return it if I hated it and buy the XL again,"" I said to myself. Well.......... I LOVE THE COSORI MORE!!!!!!! It has a square basket which fits items much better than the oval one, it's quieter, it's still a spaceship in size but it is very nice looking with the matte textured black plastic, it's truly awesome and is my addiction for life. I use it to warm up food, toast bread, make pizzas, cookies, fries, onion rings, etc., you name it. You can do almost anything with this gorgeous machine and it is super FAST (which saves you on electricity and cooking heat in your house). If you are questioning some brands, I strongly encourage you to just buy the Cosori because you will be happier sooner than later. Lastly, please be sure to take out ALL the cardboard after unpacking and before cooking anything. I washed the basket but I was so excited to try it I had blind eyes to the cardboard which was still ""underneath"" the basket area. Very careless of me. All is well, and I use my Cosori every day.

  First use was to cook french fries.  Instructions followed precisely.  Some fries were overdone while others were under done.  Second use was to cook grated potatoes for use as a bed for pulled pork.  Followed an air fryer recipe.  Noted that the potatoes were becoming very brown and crisp on the outside but not cooking on the center.  Tried to stir them and continued.  Checked again before time was up – they were over done (very brown and dry).  Placed on warm cycle while pork and corn were heated (4 minutes).  Potatoes continued to cook and were just shy of being charcoal.  Third try was broccoli.  It also turned out overdone and somewhat charred.  Last attempt was an egg test.  Cooked egg in a silicon muffin cup.  Egg was overdone and uncooked, possibly according to the burner pattern.  This is unacceptable.  Returned the unit.

  Great air fryer.  One thing I disliked was the super loud menu beeps.  I scoured the internet and emailed the company to no avail.  However I did take matters into my own hands and fixed the loud beep.  This was very easy to do, however, be warned and do not do this if you feel at all uncomfortable with the steps.There is no built in way to lower or disable the beeps from pressing menu buttons.  Here's what I did.  You can pop the top off which is held on with plastic clips all around. Oh btw do this at your own risk, I'm only reporting what I did which most certainly was dangerous risky voided warranty etc. And for goodness sake people, unplug it and leave it be to cool down and stuff. Anywho, pop the top and locate the round black speaker on the circuit board. You can take a pair of needle nose pliers and pull off the black cover to the speaker. You can identify the speaker by seeing the board notated as BUZR next to it. The black cover piece to speaker has a hole in center of it. After pulling it off (gentle force) there is a circular flat disc, seen in pic, appears to be possibly magnetic. Simply pick it off and replace the black speaker cover. Boom no sound. Here's the downside, there is no sound at all for anything anymore.

  I wanted a new, larger air fryer as my OG Philips was getting old (albeit still running great!) - so I decided against my better judgment to try a cheaper brand based on the great reviews....but ended up regretting it immensely. Initial impression was that it looked great out of the box, but when using it I noticed the build of the machine was of much lower quality than my old Philips.Just some cons to note (tried it for 1 month):-The basket was really hard to pull in and out of the air fryer as well as difficult to detach from the bottom basket-Like other reviews mentioned, the touchpad is wonky and unresponsive. I had to touch buttons multiple times repeatedly for it to respond and it was really annoying-Biggest con for me... THE SMELL. Immediately when opening the basket, I noticed a very strong, unpleasant chemical/plastic smell. Based on instructions, it said to run the air fryer empty on high for 10-15min. However, the smell would not go away and seeped into my food, making it inedible (not to mention making my kitchen smell terrible). I tried washing multiple times, running with lemon/vinegar water, running on empty for MULTIPLE times, etc. This chemical smells reinforces my feeling that the materials they use are cheap and low quality.-Final straw... I finally got the smell to be bearable, but when I tried heating up some food, the machine started only blowing COLD air and wouldn't work...tldr; Smelled gross & stopped working after a month with less than 10 uses so I returned it and am going to buy a new Phillips XXL instead :)

I have to admit, I am a sucker for new appliances.  I jumped on sous-vide, which I actually think is the most delicious way to cook cuts of meat especially when entertaining or cooking large cuts but it takes time and some preparation and some mess (mainly in that you still have to use the stove or grill to sear the meat).  Still love it but use less often than at first (it doesn't take much room so no bother).  I then jumped on the insta-pot.  Tried to use it a lot but now it has ended up mostly just being a smaller slow cooker than the one I have.  The pressure cook feature (and other features) can be convenient but not worth having a bulky extra appliance for if you already have a slow cooker.  Now comes to the air fryer.  I had big concerns because of it's size - larger than the previous two things I mentioned.  I saved all the packing material with expectation that I would ship it back.  Much to my surprise, not only does it cook the fries/nuggets (and chicken wings I might add) much better than the oven, it cooks hamburger, chicken, steak, seafood, vegetables, garlic bread . . . almost everything you could cook on the stove/oven quickly and with a really good result (once you get a handle on the temp/time requirements).  On top of that, the cooking is all contained so it doesn't make a mess of your stove, oven, countertops, or pans and it 's cooking tray is very easy to clean - imagine no grease to clean up from the stove area after frying..  I often make 2-3 different things sequentially which makes me at times wish I had two.  That way I could cook the main and side dishes (ie. nuggets/fries) at the same time (although you probably can do it with just one but I have done that yet due to capacity).  My stove/oven usage has dropped by at least 50-70%.  Because of that, I leave this unit out all the time.  It is bulky for a small kitchen (like mine) but fortunately I have a small table just off the kitchen in the breakfast area where this fits without being in the way.  Yes, in the breakfast area because this makes no mess outside of the cooker and it looks attractive enough not to be an eye sore.  Now lets talk size.  I bought the 5.8qt and am so glad I did.  One of the only two wishes I had for this unit is that it held more, although I find this to be mostly adequate for a family of four and I don't think I would want it to take up any more space.  It can cook 3 - 4 large chicken breasts or 4 hamburgers at one time and I am sure it would cook bacon very well but you may not get more than 6- 8 slices in there.  I don't think this brand is any better or worse in this regard compared to other brands of the same volume spec.  I believe there are some models that have a rack so you can increase food capacity.  I'm not sure how well this works but from simple observation of how air fying works I think it would.  Also note, the smaller volume (ie. 3qt) versions are not that much smaller on the outside but noticeably smaller in cooking capacity.Now for the fryer review.  Having not had another, I am very pleased with this model and would recommend.  As I have noted, I like the way it cooks and looks.  Food is very crispy on the outside and finished nicely on the inside and it cooks the entire contents very evenly.  It seems to be well built and the cooking pan/parts are very easy to clean.  The controls are logical and the buttons are touch sensitive.  My second minor wish is that the buttons would be more consistent in their sensitivity but I realize they were designed this way for easy cleaning - so probably a worthwhile trade-off.  In short I highly recommend this brand.  I've only been using it a month and so far no problems.  If I have any problems in quality or durability moving forward I will update this review.  Most of all, I highly recommend having an air fryer.  This is an appliance I can see myself using every day and for a long time.

    Good air fryer but there is a WARNING!!
  
",4.0,Waldy,"Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  The air fryer works great. I use it everyday and I know there’s plenty more that I can cook/bake in it. I fully recommend the product, however buyers need to be aware of the following:1) it is not the easiest to clean. The slots on the sides to allow air flow will routinely build up grease and it is not easy to get off.2) and this is a WARNING: there are a few screws that attach the handle to the basket. THESE SCREWS BECOME LOOSE AND WILL FALL OUT!! This is a common issue for other people that have purchased this air fryer. This could potentially cause the handle to fall off while carrying extremely hot food. Be sure to check and tighten them frequently!

  I got this air fryer, COSORI Air Fryer,Max XL 5.8 Quart, and used it to fry chicken drumsticks and root vegetables. I had to fry the drumsticks in 3 batches because of the quantity. There were 15 drumsticks, so I thought that this would be  a great way to quickly fry and save time without having to deep fry. As the unit cooked there was a smell of plastic but the top of the unit is plastic. I figured that the smell was coming from the top plastic - heat rises! However, the frying basket is metal and coated with a nonstick application. I did not think or believe that the smell was coming from the basket as well. Well, all the food cooked in this air fryer tasted like plastic! I had to throw it all away. Even my 16 year old grandson who will eat pretty much anything, wouldn’t eat it after tasting it. So, 3 batches of chicken drumsticks and 1 batch of root veggies was wasted. That’s 4 uses of the COSORI Air Fryer Max XL! Save your money and time and invest in a deep fryer or oven fry to save on fat consumption. I live in Arizona, so running the oven is rough in 100+ temperatures.

  The touch controls on the fryer are a JOKE!! They hardly recognize touch so it’s very frustrating trying to change the cook time or temperature. Usually takes pressing 3 or 4 times hunting for the “sweet spot” that works for the button.It took me 2 hours to get the device connected to my WiFi network because the application sucks!The non-stick is starting to rub off where the basket and bottom tray touch. There is no filter or anything on the back so the wall behind the air fryer has grease and small food bits all over it. Luckily the wall has tile so I can scrub it off with harsh cleaning chemicals. If it were a painted wall it would never come off.On a positive note, the fryer cooks nicely.

  Where have you been all my life? I guess I came late to the game because, this is my first air fryer. I’ve been suffering through the messy grease spattered stove all these years when I didn’t need to. I’m so happy I ordered this COSORI Air Fryer!This is so easy to use. You push the power button then everything illuminates. After preheating, you have buttons for whatever you are cooking. Beef, chicken, fish, veggies and more. Even a bacon button. BACON! No more oooo, ouch, making bacon or that awful clean up! I hate cleaning under the range hood!Clean up with this air fryer is a breeze. I know it says you can put it in the dishwasher but, after it cools down, I just wash it the sink with a little soap and hot water. The basket pops out easily and nothing sticks to any of the parts.  I love the texture on the outside of the air fryer. It wipes down easily and shows no fingerprints. I chose the red color. It looks great on my counter and it’s footprint is really no more than my 4 slice toaster.I’m so happy with this purchase I’ve used it every night for the last 2 weeks! My husband is very happy with the results. I’ve tried several of the recipes that came with the air fryer. I gotta say the bacon cheese turkey burgers were amazing!!!! Oh, and the fried chicken! Best thing is is I don’t think I’ve used more than a half a cup of oil in over two weeks of use and probably not even that much. Healthy fried food? Who knew?

    Simple to use, gets food cooked faster than oven
  
",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2021","









  
  
    
  Had this for about a week and have been using it daily. So far it works well. I made simple food like fries, various vegetables, and some marinated chicken (not together, all were separate meals).My fries certainly cooked through but were a bit limp the first time around and I expect this was because I used too much oil when I coated them in spices. The second time I didn't use oil at all and even patted the potatoes dry before cooking, and they came out very crispy. Next time I'll try for something in the middle. All of the fried veggies were tasty but nothing that I can't get from baking them on a sheet pan in the oven. They took less time in the air fryer so that is a benefit. The chicken would have benefited from less time in the fryer but that is my own trial and error since meat cuts can vary in size. Still came out tasty and moist since they've been marinating for a few hours.Cleanup is simple; just have to wait for the whole thing to cool down, then I've been giving it a gentle wipe down but haven't made anything messy enough to warrant a full scrub yet.Overall I'm happy with the purchase. It hasn't done anything unexpected yet (I saw some reviews about it leaking steam but have not had that happen. My coffee machine makes more visible steam than this thing does). Its been a good addition to my kitchen so far.

  My Cosori Wi-Fi air fryer has immediately become an indispensable kitchen appliance.  We prepare meals a minimum of 3 times a week.  With a tiny amount of olive oil we are able to prepare an entrée or side with an average of 8 minutes.  Then we rinse and place the basket in our dishwasher for quick clean-up.  We purchased the air fryer over 3 months ago, have used it at least 40-60 times and the basket's Teflon coating remains intact with no evidence of wear or defect.  We use silicon utensils to remove food so not the scratch the basket's interior surface.  This particular Cosori air fryer has a large capacity 5.8 quarts and the outstanding Wi-Fi smartphone and Alexia interface with Cosori's smartphone software application.  This application contains a large number of recipes and permits the user the capability of inputting their own air fryer recipes.  My smartphone and Alexia bring outstanding smart technology to manage my cooking times and technique with perfection.  Without hesitation I say my family are EXTREMELY satisfied with our Cosori Wi-Fi 5.8 quart air fryer!  Imagine during the last 3 months, 40-60 uses, we have used less than a half cup of olive oil for cooking!  That's VERY heart healthy!  An outstanding choice for a top rated air fryer.  Yes choose Cosori!!!  We are a satisfied Cosori consumer!!!

  My first meal was two frozen veggie burger patties, and about two cups of frozen broccoli and frozen brussels sprouts.I'd rate the fryer ""promising but not mind blowing"". Keep in mind the meal choice, at best, is a 6 out of 10 no matter how you cook it.The fryer made the outside of the frozen veggies sorta charred and crisp, but moist in the center (frozen sprouts are always mushy in the middle so they sucked as usual). I didn't use any oil, but lightly coating them I think would improve the results.Veggie patties are essentially hockey pucks regardless of cooking method. Fryer did nothing to improve them nor make them worse.The fryer connects to Alexa, but I can't think of a scenario where I'd have to remotely tell it to cook or stop cooking.With better ingredients, I think it could be pretty decent, though I think figuring out cooking times will be key. Gonna go grocery shopping and maybe try some of the recipes it comes with.Recipes are accessible via the app, then after you prep the food, you control the fryer through the app to cook the recipe to the recommended settings. Kinda cool.Lastly I got the 5.8Q size which I think is the largest from Cosori in the ""cooking bucket"" format. Personally think is fine for cooking for one person, maybe 2 depending on what you're making.

",4.0,Rafael,"Reviewed in the United States September 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was originally going to purchase another brand since it was 10qtz in size which was much more ideal for me, however it has been out of stock for a while so I decided to get this one instead and honestly.... im not disappointed. This air fryer actually hold its own in terms of size, and functionality, for reference you can fit a whole small chicken or 5 large chicken legs with no issues, and the pre sets are on point with the cooking time. Food cooks pretty fast, within 20 minutes you can get a few things done, Such as roasted potatoes and some fried/roasted chicken. Totally time efficient.Cons, the only issue I have with this air fryer is that the heat tends to flow more on a specific side, so food that tends to settle on the ""weak spot"" usually end up unevenly cooked, not horribly uncooked however, ive had an easy time fixing that by just shaking the basket and setting up 5 extra minutes to cook. I do like that the air fryer will tell you on the screen at some point to ""shake the basket"", it will almost always tell you this, so that you can redistribute the food evenly. Especially important if you're cooking things like French fries/loose foods. Another con would be the material for the basket.... it seems to be teflon or some sort of cheap non stick material which are usually not that great for our health so id caution everyone to NEVER scrub the basket and simply just use a soft sponge to avoid the material from scraping off over time.All in all, the air fryer is doing an amazing job. I havemt used my stove in over a week because I've been roasting all my food on this. However, if you're looking for something to bake a large cake, casserole etc. Then this is not it, its simply too small for larger dishes or a big family. A 8 to 10Q air fryer or convection oven might be more ideal. The air fryer also looks nice on the kitchen and doesn't take too much space. The noise isn't too bad either. It won't replace your stove altogether, but it makes an amazing addition for smaller 'side dishes' that would otherwise take forever to make on a normal oven or stoveBelow for reference are some photos of a medium and mini loaf pans you can fit in the basket:Both Mini pan dimensions: 5²³/32 in. X3 ⁵/16 in. X 1⁷/8 in.Medium: 8 in. X 3 ⁷/8 in. x 2 ¹⁵/32 in.I will update you all in regards to the durability and functionality over time and see if anything changes.

  I have had 4 air fryers at this point, different sizes and different brands and so far this one has been my favorite. I love how big it is and the square shape. However, what inspired me to buy it was the fact you can press a release button and the basket comes out. This makes it easy to dump the food right onto a plate or dish, my old ninja (which worked great) just had an attachment that fit snug in the bottom so I couldn’t dump the food out with out getting the crumbs, juices, and oil that had accumulated at the bottom on top of all the food. This is easy to use also. There are pre-set settings or you can change the temperature and cook time manually (just have to press a button once or twice) I have made frozen snack type food in it and food i battered or breaded myself. Both come out amazing. I bought an oil spritzer off Amazon and fill it with olive oil or coconut oil and spritz the food every 5 minutes then shake the basket and continue cooking. That really makes a difference in the final product when it comes to homemade breaded dishes. If you are thinking of buying an air fryer I highly recommend this one. This is even great to reheat leftovers. (Pizza may even be BETTER the next day if you are warm it up in the air fryer). I haven’t had any issues but I have only had it for like two weeks. With in those two weeks I have used it almost everyday. My kids love it and my 9 year old uses it by herself constantly. (Chicken nuggets, fish sticks, frozen popcorn shrimp, pizza pockets, cheese sticks all that junk) So yes I’d definitely recommend this air fryer!

I basically got it to cook wings for football games, but now am cooking most of everything I eat. I have read other reviews that talk about the plastic smell, and even the taste of plastic; however, I can say that once I smelled the plastic I felt defeated. I didn't want to return this possible dream come true, I had dreams of not buying stock in BWW. But low and behold, while retrieving the lot number, I noticed that parts of the styrofoam had broken off, and gotten caught up in a crease; after I removed, everything was great.

I'm glad I have the wifi model because that still works perfectly. I press on front panel buttons and sometimes have to do it hard. I often cannot adjust time or temperature. I'm afraid it fail completely soon. We wash the basket in dishwasher and found the screws holding the basket to he handle worked out. I lost two and was able to find substitutes and ended up buying another basket since I sometimes will cook different things for the same meal.There is a bit of learning curve but the included recipe book and the app are very helpful.

You can comfortably fit 3 average chicken breasts (is that a unit of measurement????) lol.  I like the safety feature it has where if you remove the tray while it’s mid-cook, it will stop the cook automatically.  Once you re-insert it will resume.  It’s relatively easy to clean, I personally don’t use the dishwasher because I am afraid of it rusting.  The only con so far is that it’s quite loud.

  So this airfryer is good quality in my opinion. It makes great french fries from scratch and makes crispy tater tots no oil needed. Also I made hamburger patties on the steak setting and pork chops. The pork chops came out pretty crispy but I did notice that putting just one allows the meat to crisp up more than having two peices. I would say this works better for individual meals than for large quatities when it comes to meat. I feel that this fryer gets a bad rep because the cooking times in the cookbook are wrong but the temperature at which they should cook at are right. A lot of the times when I let the food fry for the time said in the cookbook it would burn. My recommendation would be to cook the food for less time than precribed and then if it needs more time simply add more time. That is how I started to get better results whith the airfryer because it acctually does a good job. Its just the cookbook thats off. The machine is pretty easy to use and manual explains everthing clearly.  Clean up is easy just make sure to use hot water, the manual said cold water could damage the fryer.

  It is very nice and works well.  We use it all of the time.  But just a heads up to save you a problem.  We have had ours for about 5 months and on the inside of the basket and carrier both, there are 3 or 4 Philipps screws.  Tonight my wife was washing it and one fell out and  went down the garbage disposal. She was able to get it back.  Upon checking I found that all were loose.  So save yourself  possible headache and check them and tighten them up.

  I bought this Air Fryer two weeks ago, the item arrived fast. It was very well packed no damage. When I opened the box the Air Fryer looked brand new, however, the display was all scratched like someone has grabbed their keys and scratched all over the display. I called COSORI customer serviced, the gentlemen was so polite and professional, they offered a replacement right away. They grabbed my information and Amazon order number, I GIVE AN A+ FOR THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICES.The replacement arrived 4 days later, brand new no scratch, I am still learning how to use it, but we already love it. I cooked fries, chicken and steak. This air fryer is very hot so you have to be very careful with timing. I love how it beeps when you have to flip or shake.As for the taste, I don't know if it is because it is new, but my food tasted a little bit like the Cosori, I don't know how to explain in, but I'm guessing it is because the product is new, because the same thing happened with my pressure cooker.My husband and I definitely recommend this air fryer.

  After 6 months, this product is falling apart. The basket inside the drip pan moves and vibrates during cooking. It has chaffed away significant sections of the Teflon coating on the drip pan. This immediately rusted. Also the crimp at the top of the fryer basket has rust all of the way around under the lip. When you do the 5 minute preheat, very often the pan ""Pops"" out of the heating area. It moves very far. If you have the fryer on the edge of a counter, the basket will fall to the floor. The plastic on the handle broke on mine after a few of these falls. The flavor of the food is incredible. But I will look for another brand than Cosori.

  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Cosori Air Fryer!!!  Fried foods are my favorites, but I hate cleaning up the mess.  Even though I am on the keto eating plan, I still don't like cleaning up the mess of frying food, especially bacon.  I knew a year ago I wanted an air fryer, and it took me awhile to pick out which one was right for me.  I researched, and I read reviews.  Finally I decided upon the Cosori.  The main reason I picked this one were the reviews, not only for the air fryer, but for the positive Cosori customer service reviews.I waited to write this review because I wanted to see how I liked it.  I've had it for two months now, and I purchased it at the regular price.  I also have not had any reason to contact their customer service.  I have used it everyday now, sometimes 2-3 times a day.It is sooo easy to clean.  After cooking, any grease I pour into an old coffee container, and then wipe it with paper towel before I use soap and a sponge (the soft side, not the scouring side.)  The baskets can go into the dishwasher, but so far I have washed it by hand each time because I use it so often, and I don't run the dishwasher every day.I have cooked bacon, steaks, sausage patties, frozen chicken wings, frozen chicken breasts, hamburgers, hotdogs, vegetables, etc.  I plan on experimenting with desserts eventually ... just haven't done it yet.  The first week of using the air fryer, I overcooked a few items, especially frozen vegetables like broccoli, trying to figure out the time of cooking.  No big deal.  I ate it anyway.  It has preset times, which I use every so often, but I wanted to understand the fryer so I experimented more.  I only cook for three people, sometimes four, so the size is just right.  If there is something in particular that I want to cook in it, I read air fryer recipes and ideas from others, then I adapt it to my likes and eating needs.  I am so very happy with my purchase!!!!  I hope this review helps make your decisions easier.

  I bought the fryer in November 2018.  I registered it for an extra year (2 years) of warrantee.  I recently contact the company explaining the drawer no long locked (clicked) in place as would not operate unless I jammed it closed with something heavy in front of the drawer.  I sent a picture of the top of the drawer showing the piece that ""clicks"" when you try to push the drawer in place.  I also sent a copy of the extended warrantee I had registered.What I got back from their customer support was instructions to send them a video of the drawer being inserted (and presumably popping back out), a copy of the purchase order and a (re) statement of the problem.  I suspect all that is designed to make me just go away.  It has, except for this review.What the company got from me is a (former) customer who will not replace this fryer with another one from CORSORI.If you think you will like this fryer, roll the dice and hope you never need it warrantee service.  Other than the lousy customer service and the drawer latch design, it's not a bad fryer.

   I bought this unit from Amazon Warehouse and it was listed as  Used - very good. The unit was brand new and the packaging was damaged. I used it for a few months and it quit working.  It was supposed to have a one year warranty so I contacted the manufacturer and explained that the basket latching system had failed.  I could  wiggle it and pull up and it would turn on the unit until you let loose. (see video)  They suggested that I clean the unit (even though I told them that I had already tried that) and they would not honor the warranty because it was listed a s used because  I bought it from Amazon Warehouse. The bottom line is that I will not purchase ANYTHING from Cosori. I believe that this product is defective in its design of its latching mechanism.  Cosori used a loop hole to justify not honoring their warranty.  The unit was never used before I received it.  It failed within the warranty period and they will not replace or repair the unit. BUYER BEWARE!(update)I reviewed the Amazon Warehouse policy and I was not eligible for the  company warranty as they had stated.I contacted  support noting that the unit was unused when  I received it and that I was disappointed that they wouldn't honor the warranty. In between time, I tore into the defective unit and found a micro switch that signaled the presence of the cooking tray had failed.  I ordered a replacement for $5 and it is on its way. Meanwhile Cosori contacted me  and made a ONE TIME EXCEPTION  and was shipping me a replacement unit.The bottom line is that I changed  this review to 3 stars because they considered the situation.

  Controls are well laid out.  Pre-heat makes getting set easy.  Generous basket size.  Amazingly non-stick, even in the base unit with bacon or longer fried foods.  I've used foil to cover the base under the bracket to ease cleanup, but you really don't have to since it washes out SO EASILY.  The snowflake icon button for frozen foods is just right and I have developed a habit of delicious frozen brussel sprouts air fried on a regular basis.  Who would have thought?  Perfect for households of two or three, or even four.  Easy and fast chicken breasts or thighs or tenders, shrimp, asparagus, jicama fries, etc.  Haven't tried steak since I prefer sous vide slower cooking for those followed by a quick pan sear, but burgers were good.  Most pics show french fried potatoes, which are good, but don't overload the basket like those many photos show---that won't work well.  Oh, and I love the ""shake"" reminder which comes on autamically on a few of the icon button foods.  When you take the tray out to shake the oven pauses and restarts at the same place on the timer to continue the cook.  Highly recommend the Cosori Air fryer.

  The quick review:  I love this AF. I’m glad I trusted the 10,000 people who gave this Corsori 5.8 QT AF high reviews. I can’t imagine anyone regretting purchasing this item.Detailed review:  This is my first AF and I read a lot of reviews and watched quite a few videos giving AF reviews. I have a family of 5 and my youngest is a 6’ tall teenage boy so I basically cook for 5 adults so AF cooking capacity was a factor.  Other factors I considered where ease of cleaning, ease of use, how much I thought I’d actually use an AF, and cost.I only have had this AF for 5 days as of 7/24/20.  I will update this post in a few weeks. I have used this AF every day since using it.**UPDATE 8/5/2020**:  I have used this air fryer every single day since I purchased it.  I am amazed at how easy it makes cooking chicken breasts, chicken tenders, and pork chops.  I especially like how the meat is fully cooked (I test using a meat thermometer) but still so tender and juicy.  On my list of foods to try are a whole chicken and steaks.  My teens use it to toast their sandwiches for lunch.  It's awesome at reheating leftovers (especially pizza!!!).  Oh, yes, it makes awesome fries and onion rings.  I am so happy I finally purchased an air fryer, and this Corsori is still easy to clean (even after I made pork chops with a lot of sauce the other night), easy to use, and has made cooking so much easier.  I continue to highly recommend the Corsori 5.8 QT Air Fryer.What I have made so far:*French fries (frozen) - yes, excellent!!  Easily handled entire bag and the fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, just how I like them.*Fried zucchini:  the traditional flour, egg wash, breading. Instead of frying in a skillet of oil I simply misted the slices with olive oil. They were wonderful. Next time, I will try to make a keto version of these.*chicken breakfast sausage links - also very good*frozen salmon patties that I purchase at Costco - very good!  What I like about this is that the salmon patties are usually my lunch. I practice 16:8 intermittent fasting. I don’t have the patience to do a lot of cooking for my first meal of the day and I want protein. This AF quickly cooks my salmon patty, it is delicious, and clean-up is a breeze!*Italian hot sausage sandwiches - oh my! ❤️  I purchased the accessories for this AF. I used the cake pan in the AF to cook the onions and peppers.  Then, I removed the veggies and cooked the sausages. My entire family and I loved how the AF cooked the sausages - crisp on the outside but juicy on the inside. Once the sausages were cooked, I made the sandwiches (sliced the sausage roll, put a sausage link in the roll, topped the sausage with the already cooked veggies. I put the sandwiches in the AF at 380° for 2 minutes.  Oh my!  I wish I had better words to describe just how good these sandwiches were!  Disclaimer:  I could have squeezed 3 sandwiches in at once but everything I’ve read says airflow is important, so I only did 2 at a time.** update 8/5/20:  I have also made boneless chicken breasts, bone-in chicken pieces (breasts, wings, drumsticks), and pork chops.  Everything has turned out great!Size:  the square basket (vs a round basket) seems to make the cooking capacity of the 5.8 QT Corsori greater than similarly sized AF’s.  I considered an oven style AF but I didn’t want to lose that much counter space. I am quite happy with the size of this AF.Ease of cleaning:  Every time I use this AF and then clean it, I am AMAZED at how easy it is to clean!  👍👍Ease of use:  As I stated earlier, this is my first air fryer. I find it very easy to use. It’s fairly self-explanatory with the preset buttons.How much I thought I’d use an AF:  This point was very important to me.  I have been the proud owner for 5 years, at least, of a bread machine that I’ve only used less than 10 times. Please don’t judge me, I hear about it all the time from my family. I have used this AF everyday since I received it, some days twice. I see this AF becoming an essential tool in my kitchen.Cost:  I am a big believer in “you get what you pay for”.  That said, I have 2 kids in college and another one that will be headed to college in a few years, so I can’t unwisely throw money around. I don’t have any experience with any other air fryers, so I can’t comment on whether I think more expensive brands are worth the extra expense or not. What I can say is that I think I definitely got my money’s worth with the Corsori 5.8 QT air fryer.Final words:  if you are lost in the sea of various air fryer brands, in my opinion you will be very happy if you decide to purchase the Corsori 5.8 QT air fryer.I purchased the AF with my own money and I am not reimbursed in any way for this review. I seldom write reviews but I am so impressed with this AF and I want to help anyone who is as befuddled as I was when I was trying to chose which AF to purchase.Other recommendations:  I did purchase the accessories that are available from Corsori for this AF. I am glad I did, they make the AF even more versatile. I recommend having tongs that are safe for scratch resistant surfaces. Lastly, I did put an insulated counter protector under my AF. It doesn’t seem to get that hot under my AF but I have new counters, so I am using a protector just in case.

  While I love this product up until this week, things have changed based on my ability to contact the company.  I have had my air fryer for 5-6 months.  The food is always amazing, however i was cooking pork chops earlier this week and about 6 minutes in while I was making some sides, the drawer shot out of the air fryer and onto the floor.  The drawer broke and doesn't sit sealed in the air fryer any more.I figured i would contact the manufacture and just order a new drawer and bin to go inside the fryer.  However, they do not have an email to contact only a phone number.  While my work schedule in production I can't call during their business hours.  This has caused me to go from cooking with it every night to nothing and I don't know how to fix it.  I don't want to buy another complete unit, when only the drawer needs to be replaced on this one.

  I was very skeptical about purchasing one of these (air fryers) but after a visit to my niece's house, seeing how quick and easy it was to cook frozen chicken strips in less time than it takes my oven to pre-heat, I decided to give it a go.  After it arrived and I initially washed it/found a place for it in the kitchen, I went to the store and purchased a variety of frozen foods to put it through its paces. I made french fries first and they turned out great, very crispy just as I like them.  Next was jalapeno poppers, chicken strips, and frozen battered fish.  I just finished making some breaded mushrooms and turkey burgers in it this evening and everything has turned out either as expected or has surpassed my expectations.It's easy enough for just about anyone to use and clean up is a breeze.  I'm only giving it four stars at this time because I have yet to try out some of the other cooking features but will be happy to up it to five stars if I continue to be as please with it as I have been so far.  I also really like the look of it; it's not a shiny black, it is more of a matte black which makes it match better with my other appliances.  I also like that it's more square than round, fits better on my counter.  It is rather large so if you don't have the counter space you might wish to order a smaller version.  So far it's been one of the best things I've purchased for my kitchen in a long time.

  Our air fryer has served a great purpose and constantly provides us with a delicious meal. I was eager to give this product a 5 star review but here’s why I won’t. The French fry button should work for majority of all frozen French fry options, however, this has given us burnt fries on more occasions than I care to admit. I typically use the frozen food button for french fries instead of the fry button due to this issue.Aside from that flaw, everything else has been a perfect meal! Cooked flawlessly and doesn’t leave a huge grease mess or pot of fry oil to clean up after later.

   My life is changed forever omg. Buy it. Its not even debatable.  I will never cook the same. Personally I dont like cooking all that much cause the mess you have to clean up and bc of how much time it takes but this baby eliminates both problems. 10 minutes you have PERFECT fries, salmon, I cant even express my gratitude for who ever created such magic. The cook book is BOMB, cant wait to become Martha Stewart. Cant wait to throw brussel sprouts in this baby. I’m literally buying my mom one and celebrating “christmas in july” bc shes an actual cook and this is gonna changer her life. If I could choose one machine out of all I the ones I have in the kitchen this is 1st without a DOUBT.Now. Regarding plastic smell - sure ~now~ I am noticing a slight smell that comes with the frying (I thought it was what I was cooking) but its so minor and irrelevant. The machine is magic and honestly I’m sure they all have more or less of a funk. Considering the reviews this one didnt have nearly as many as others. The number of reviews cant lie. Do yourself the favor - this is one of those items that goes on the “best life investments” next to pre TSA. so buy it. And as drake once said - YOU CAN THANK ME NOW.

I love it and have made a variety of foods in it and everything has turned out great. And it is so easy to clean, simple to operate, doesn't get hot on the outside, and for the internal size, does not have a huge footprint. Fantastic product. If I had to select the kitchen appliances that I consider the most useful it would be the Cosori air fryer, a grill pan with interchangeable surfaces, a k-cup coffee machine and maybe a microwave.

  This air fryer is relatively easy to clean and heats fries, fried chicken, and bread fairly evenly. (on par with convection ovens, and better than toaster/small ovens) However, the annoying thing about this air fryer is the loud beeps that there is no way to turn off. When I originally purchased this product, I was hoping to use it in the morning, but the loud beeps make it impossible since it will wake everyone in the house up. If the loud beeps are not a concern for you, I can recommend this product. However, for me the beeps are a deal breaker.

  My husband wanted an air fryer. He kept seeing the one TV infomercial but I when I read the Amazon reviews on it. I didn’t like the ‘toxic death smell’ comments.  So after many days of research and reading reviews, I finally settled on the Corosi. First, I liked the supposed size of it.  And I also like the reviews of the preheating and shake features that make a difference from other fryers.  When it came in I was surprised at the size.And after a couple of months of owning it and using it - I AM SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS.  Size is perfect for family compared to others.  I like the squared deep basket. It is big to keep out on my counter but no biggie to pull out of pantry when needed.  The nonstick basket is easy to clean and I even purchase paper cooking liners for it that help with things sticking.  Why you should buy: 1-Preheat. If you preheat like an oven you giving food a jump on being crispy. 2-shake feature.  No it does not shake for you. But half way through cooking it beeps to alert you to move, flip, toss, shake, shimmy - whatever your food.YOU WILL NEED A LITTLE OIL FOR MAXIMUM CRISPNESS. I bought an oil sprayer that allows to spritz the food with enough to cook/crisp food.  We have used a lot for frozen items instead of using oven.  Tip: for exception of potatoes like fries - keep things in one layer. If you throw in on top items, the bottom items may not crisp up enough or you will doing a lot of turning. Takes one more run maybe but it’s worth having crispy spring rolls or taquitos when they are cooked in one layer.Did cook burgers once. Feel like it really shrunk them but they came out ok.  Did hot dog and those came out great.  My husband has done frozen chicken wings and he loved how they came out.I did buy the additional kit that has a pizza pan and other items so will need to try those considering in lock down due to COVID-19 right now.UPDATE: I have read other reviews of basket handle breaking/cracking.  With all things you cannot manhandle it.  It should not be dropped.  All it takes is a gentle push of the button and slide out.  If you treat it well and take care of it, it will work fine.

  The “touch screen” has never worked properly so there is only the pre-set 350 degree for 15 minutes that works.

I could never actually get it to sync even though it is WiFi compatible... I should have returned it but we were moving just after we got it and it didn’t get unboxed until after the returnable timeframe... pretty frustrating for the amount of money spent on it...  :/ I gave it two stars because it really does make great toast and frozen fries, you just have to set an alarm to stop it .

  This thing is LEGIT.I’ll preface why with a little background info... My wife got an InstaPot a while back and it slowly became the bane of her existence. She went through Six-dozen eggs just trying to get consistent hard-boiled eggs, ruined two roasts and a litany of other dishes in a little over two weeks. She experienced firsthand the fleeting victory of accomplishing what she set out to do only three times. THREE. Needless to say, once she’d finished going through the multiple stages of grief, rage, depression and finally acceptance, I came home from work and saw the thing in pieces scattered across my driveway. She vowed “NEVER. AGAIN.” and that was that.Until this...Months had passed and she’s started noticing her friends using air fryers. She liked what she saw but the PTSD from the InstaPot was holding on strong. She was leery at first, then decided to pull the trigger... which may or may not have been helped along when I saw the pics of fries and chicken wings... fast-forward two weeks and I came home to ridiculously mouthwatering smells and tears. Only, this time, they were tears of JOY. I looked over and our kids were savagely attacking heaping mounds of fries, nuggets, wings, corn dogs, everything. She even fried half out veggie drawer. The table looked like a cartoon version of thanksgiving, only it was a Tuesday and only a week into the Covid quarantines. My 7-year-old told me to hurry up, sit and eat before she came to her senses and took it all away. To this day, our family has known no greater homemade feast.Five stars. Would recommend.

  I found that the easy buttons work for some things and others I use the suggestions online, like Pinterest or other sites and blogs about food and recipes. The steak setting worked perfectly for three 6 oz venison steaks. The veggie and root veggie settings probably should be tweaked and set your own.The ease of the basket removal is a great feature and it makes it super easy to clean. I have not put it in the dishwasher, yet, because I clean it right away and it doesn't need any deep cleaning.Bread under the basket for bacon is a MUST, after two out of four batches to cook one 1lb package of bacon (spread the pieces out to cook thru) it started smoking pretty good, the water method is not really a good one!Read blogs and especially Pinterest for ideas, it's a great tool.You must turn things if you want crispy/browned on both sides.You must oil things (mist) to get a crispy texture.

The outside of the fryer was hot as well. I will try to get a hold of the tech support for the fryer since it’s been over a month for the amazon return.

  As per the other reviews, our oven has become redundant. Had this beauty for over 8 month now and thought I'd share our experiences.We had one which cooked everything to perfection but rather than trying to time different ingredients we bought another eg, steak in one fries in the other.Then we bought one for a family member.Here's what we cook to absolute perfection:- Bacon, perfectly crispy. Just press the bacon button. It's that easy.- Chicken thighs, gotta admit it I now eat the chicken skin. Never used to but it's crispy and delicious. Just press the chicken button. Walk away, come back. Enjoy.- Steak (you'll never use a pan again) maintains all the juices with a perfect all-round sear. Just figure out your own cooking times for how you like it cooked.- Fries, roast potatoes, potato wedges. Fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside- Roasted vegetables, cooked with a little char- Breaded fish and chicken. Even the thickest pieces of say chicken are done in 5-8 minutes. Crispy, juicy and delicious. No fat. Amazing.We pretty much use these little wizard gadgets for every home cooked meal.It will take a while to figure out your perfect cooking times for steak, breaded chicken and so on. After that unplug your oven as you won't be using it.Anything you can cook in an oven, a pan or broiler will cook and taste so much better in the air fryer in more than half the time and with just a coating of spray oil.Our biggest gamble and success was had cooking Beef Wellington and it was the best we've ever made. The pastry was cooked evenly and to crispy perfection while the fillet was beautifully medium rare. That's a lot of expensive ingredients and preparation time to gamble. Gordon Ramsey's recipe, 6 minutes at 400 and 6 at 320. Job done. Gourmet.Give it a quick rinse and it's ready to conjure up the next delicious meal with the press of a button. Feels like cheating sometimes especially with steak coming out so well. Press a button walk away come back 5 minutes later and you've got restaurant quality steak.Just be sure to always pre-heat!Not sure about other cheaper airfryers. I know preheating is essential to the crispness which I'm not sure the others have.

  Have used it a dozen times and can see it's usefulness now. I think getting a good recipe down for the flour dusting used to dredging meats and seafood breading might take a while. I mock fried some butterflied shrimp I'd prepped with egg, flour and Panko. It came out pretty well but was clear heavily breaded stuff needs to be raised from the bottom of the basket. Solution is to purchase the optional kit of accessories. Which I did. Plus the extra basket.Definitely seeing the efficiency of this thing.Hate learning new icons but once you know the relative temps you're good.Even after you choose and icon setting you can fine tune the time and temp on the fly.Nice clear alarms. Depending on icon mode you select it will beeeep half way to let you flip items in the basket. And beep again when done.Even after you choose an icon setting you can fine tune the time and or temp on the fly as necessary.

  This product deserves more than 5 stars.. it’s that good. I have been going back and forth with the idea of purchasing an air fryer for about a year now but couldn’t justify spending over 100$ for one. This one came up on a Prime Day deal for around $70.. after reading all the reviews I decided to buy it and give it a try. The reviews did not lie! This thing is great! My 4 year old loves chicken nuggets and this thing cooked frozen chicken nuggets in 10 minutes and they came out so crispy.. I am so happy that I no longer have to worry about my 4 year old asking me 100 times If his chicken nuggets are done cooking. It also came with a recipe book that has so many other recipes and recommendations.. I was actually really surprised at how many different things you can cook in here (steaks, meatballs, chicken parm, muffins, French toast) I can’t wait to try them all. The presets are really convenient and the manual cooking is also really simple and it preheats in about 5 minutes which is awesome. Although this one is big and does take up a bit of counter space, it was a great purchase especially at the discounted prime day price. I’m very happy with this product so far and I’ve already recommended it to my friends. I will definitely be purchasing the accessory set to complete this in the near future. This is definitely the best thing I’ve ever purchased off of Amazon!

  I have gone crazy and been air frying everything. I cooked hamburgers, shrimp, anything frozen, pizza, steak (Which turn out awesome and only take 16 minutes.) bacon, sausage and any vegetable I can stick in there. The key is always pre-heat, spray with oil and seasoning. The picture I included was all cooked in the fryer. Hamburger steak, asparagus, corn on the cob and sauteed mushrooms. Well OK, the gravy was done on the stove. I can set the cooking temp or setting on my phone and hit start and there it goes. And the clean up is a breeze. Nothing stick, not grease, melted cheese nothing. I have talked my neighbors into buying this model and they must be crazy because they haven't taken it out of the box yet. Oh ye of little faith, Forgive them Lord they know not what they are missing. Their loss, but I understand people fear change. This throws everything we have been taught about cooking out the window. The food is done quicker and it actually taste better.My only complaint is that maybe just on mine but the buttons are not very responsive. But with always having my phone around this has not been a deal breaker. In fact is much easier to custom set it on my phone.I love this and the wife and I have joked that we need more to cook more things at once. But until then it's nothing the warm setting on the oven hasn't solved while I cook more items.Get one, get two you won't be sorry.

",3.0,David B,"Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2019","









  
  
    
  The Air Fryer works well and is taking some time to get used to new cooking times. The rule of thumb of reducing temperature by 25 degrees and cooking time by 20 percent does not appear to hold true for this item. I have also found that with only a basket and no additional racks, the space for cooking is limited. I did buy other racks to put into the Air Fryer but the heat is distributed unevenly with the additional rack and again cooking times and temperatures need to be adjusted. Also can only add one additional rack. When I bought I thought a larger size unit would allow for more items to be cooked at once. Not the case.

  I ordered this Sept. 3, 2019 and received it today, Sept. 5th, 2019. I was excited to use it and had the food ready. I preheated it and after 2 mins, it said E1. I called the company and they said its defective!!!  Since I just had major surgery, I can not repack it. I called the company and they emailed me information which I sent the information they wanted. I will edit my review when I get a new unit. I tried 3 times to use the unit and E1 kept coming up which is open circuit temperature monitor issue. I am now waiting for a new replacement. Such a disappointment since I saw a lot of good reviews for this.Update: 10/16/19 I received a new unit but wanted to wait a few weeks to see how it works. No problems so far, and it works well. I like how it cooks food. I was told that smoke that comes out from the bottom is normal when cooking certain foods like chicken or wings.  Easy to clean baskets in dishwasher.

  Excellent customer service, basket issue was covered under warranty.Update: After about a month one of the screws fell out into my food. It stayed tight after screwing it back I'm but glad I saw it first!  Then after about 2 months it had trouble knowing the basket was closed. If I press down on the handle it turns on but then the basket is tilted out of the dryer, as soon as I let go it turns off.Original 5 star: Does so much more than appetizers. Perfectly cooks chicken, pork, potatoes, anything that you could bake or deep fry. Fried chicken in the airfryer is way  better than kfc. Reduces prep and cook time with no oil splatter, and an easy to clean basket (dishwasher safe). Works well with Alexa and the app is handy if you leave the room. Very much recommend

  ...and it's pretty incredible. 5 minutes or less to pre-heat versus my oven that takes 30 minutes? Talk about pizza rolls WHEN NEEDED. I have a large range of foods I've tried that are better in the oven, some are better in the microwave, and now some foods are better in the air fryer. Leftovers are a freaking breeze. Just go to the freezer aisle, pick out some random quick meals (like egg rolls, corn dogs, something easy a 13 year old boy would eat) and I promise the air fryer will not let you down. Stick to the oven for meats - the air fryer does seem to dry out more than I'd like.Probably my only complaint about this is the basket itself - the main basket has the handle so even though I'm comfortable sticking the metal extras in the dishwasher, the main basket gets pretty gross. It's hard to clean in my opinion because of all the ridges - sponges will be ripped apart. I would definitely recommend purchasing separate dishwasher-safe accessories if you're super lazy like me and hate handwashing.

  As others have reported, mine arrived with a non-functioning control panel.  Everything works fine through the app. This seems to be a recurring issue based on recent reviews.  My guess is they've had a bad batch of hardware as this is an otherwise highly rated product.  Awaiting a response from Cosori Support as I type.UPDATE: Support were very responsive and acknowledged the issue.  They are sending me a replacement from a new batch once they are available.  They also seem genuinely interested in tracing all the bad items and asked for a photo of the etched batch number on the bottom of the unit.Upgrading to 3 stars for now.  Once I get the replacement and verify it works I'll review my rating again.UPDATE: My replacement arrived very quickly and I'm happy to report this unit is fully functional.

  Love this thing.  Cooking is actually fun again -- no more sticking my hands in a hot oven or getting burned by splattering grease on the stovetop.  The steaks come out juicy and tender on the inside, as they should, yet they are still cooked properly.  And don't even get me started on the fantastic french fries.  I even cooked a whole chicken breast in there yesterday.  While it just fit in the basket diagonally, I did have to perform a little surgery on the sternum as the basket was not quite deep enough, but it was worth the effort.  I have had this air fryer for only a week and a half, but am using it daily to experiment with.  As for those complaints about these baskets falling apart easily, I am checking each time I use it to make sure both parts are latched together properly before lifting them, and being careful to not touch the release button (which has a built-in safety cover) until I have set the unit down.  It seems to be very well built and cleans easily.  Cosori even provides a customer-support phone number, which is rare these days, and they are also offering an extra year warranty for free, if the form they provide is sent in within two weeks of purchase, which I did.  All the directions are clear and easily understandable, and the recipe book is quite handy for learning of the possibilities.  Plus, the machine offers suggested temperatures and cook times on its dashboard, all of which can easily be overridden by any preferred changes.  All in all, I am completely satisfied... no, change that to ""elated,"" by this product.  If anything changes, I will update this review.

  Although I researched and this came up as one of the better air fryers, I’m disappointed with my purchase. Biggest qualm is that anything you cook ends up tasting like the smell of the fryer. What I mean by that is, the plastics and material it’s constructed from can be smelt and tasted the first time you use.

  This is my second air fryer, my first one I inherited from my parents who love to buy all the gadgets but almost never actually use them.I absolutely love it, but one thing drives me insane. The controls. Instead of having individual buttons which adjust temperature and time, you have to select the temperature and then use the same + or - to adjust it up or down, then you select time and use the same buttons. It would be much easier to have them separate. Also the power button could just as easily serve as the button to turn it on. I can't tell you how many times I have adjusted the time and temperature only to turn it off on accident. It takes a lot of brain power not to. It might be because it is my second and my first had better controls.That said, this one is a superior cooker, it is superior at cleaning. It is absolutely beautiful to look at. I love the square basket. The handle and attachment mechanism is much better designed.But I must say, if Cosori updated the controls, I'd buy a new one and pass this onto someone else.

  I'm not a great cook, but the air fryer is pretty fool proof. There are a few things that catch me off guard when I use it though:1. The temperature only goes up in intervals of 10, so if directions tell you to cook at 375 you have to either go 370 or 380 and adjust cooking times. Not a huge deal, but still a little off-putting if you aren't cooking savvy.2. Cleaning the product is kind of weird. I'm very careful about keeping things clean, and this airflow fryer tests me each time. There are these little air hole/vents on the part you pull out. Whenever I soak the basket to make sure I can get everything off while damaging the basket coating as little as possible. When I go to clean the basket and drawer, little food particulates end up stuck inside. It takes a lot of poking and prodding to get everything out. There are screws holding everything in place, so in theory you could take it apart to clean, but who wants to take something apart each clean?Aside from that the air fryer itself works wonders. I've made a couple of chicken dishes that turned out wonderful, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Pre-made things are good too, like store bought sweet potato fries from Trader Joe's. I received this as a gift, but I would have little hesitation buying it for myself again.

It uses a heating element and a fan to cook food fast which produces moist hot air and sometimes steam depending on what you're cooking. The steam has to go somewhere. I haven't had much dripping or pooling under this unit but when compared to my grease fryer this is easy to clean. If you find an air fryer that doesn't release moist hot air 'steam', it's either not plugged in or is secretly a star trek food replicator. ;).  PS: Please post link if u find a replicator.

  I love my air fryer. It cooks most things in about 40-50% less time than a conventional oven. It basically is a mini convection oven but it is extremely  efficient and leaves your food crispy but not over cooked. I’ve made multiple potato recipes that come out great (a mid size potato takes maybe 25 minutes to bake through) and chicken comes out great, cooked fully but not dried out at all. I also love cooking vegetables in this thing! A tiny spray of oil and a shake half way through and that’s it! The fryer is large so you can fit a fair amount of food at a time in it. It has a release button that is covered by a plastic slide so you don’t accidentally release it while it’s hot lol which I thought was a nice touch. It does not make your kitchen hot like an oven, it’s fairly quiet and fits on a countertop. I find myself rarely using my regular oven unless it’s a larger item I can’t fit in my air fryer. Plus you can find literally thousands of recipes online!IMPORTANT!!Make sure to read instructions fully and run the air fryer on preheat before using! You might notice a smell that will potentially transfer to your food. I ran mine twice and the smell went away. I’ve read reviews where people say their food tasted like burnt plastic and that’s because they did not do this step!

Of course I had to show my sister on facetime. she was the one who told me there was something wrong  and that the buttons should be more responsive. I called customer service, they were brilliant, very accommodating, and shipped me a new one within two days! Great product, great customer service.

  I like the design. It looks so beautiful on my countertop. The basket is big enough for a medium size chicken so there is plenty of space. A recipe book also comes with the package which saves me lots of time. There are 5 cooking modes and a preheat setting and I can control the machine through the app, which enables me to plan for meals.

  Amazing top tier air frier, price is worth it as I bought a cheaper brand on here that was a nightmare to clean. I eventually tossed the old one and got this.Cooks everything from freezer food to bread/baked goods. Now gets more use than my oven. Cheese, grease nothing sticks to this air fryer. I handwash and have no issues easily getting anything stuck to the basket off with a normal plastic brush scrubber in a couple mins. I don't think it's dishwasher safe but don't know for sure as I have never needed to do that..No more baking soda vinegar scrub downs for hrs that barely get my fryer clean. Tons of settings and a wifi mode (not that I use that very much). Boyfriend and a couple family members have bought them. Highly recommend corsiar brand, they have been what I was looking for for years!

    Amazing unit.....COSORI vs. Nuwave which is better?

  Ok Air Fryer Ladies and Gent, I am actually doing this review over as I have not had this product for about 2 months. This review will over this unit and the Nuwave Air fryer just in case you were thinking of getting it. I had that one for about a year and a half.First the Nuwave, It cooks very well. You get accurate cooking times and does a nice job of getting items crisp. HOWEVER, there are a few MAJOR CONS. The first and in my opinion a deal breaker for me. The Basket. The basket not only breaks all the time meaning when you go to close the door it will not it has issues closing. There are times I must let the unit cool then it will finally close. Not the greatest when you have to open it to shake the items but then can't close it for an hour. The company would not help at all they said buy a new basket….lol. The 2nd is cleaning it. Let us just assume the door had no issues. Cleaning it is a nightmare. Any sponge will either get stuck in the grooves or just not clean well. You can put in the dish Washer but who wants to do that after each time? Result DO NOT BUY THISCOSORI  - 5.8Cooks a little longer than the Nuwave but by a few min. Honestly, once you get used to the timings it’s a breeze. Cleaning. OMG so easy I use this 2 or 3 times a week its that easy to clean. Less than 5 min to clean. My honest opinion, best Air Fryer ever. I will say this. Chicken Wings on the Nuwave comes out a tad better but it’s just not worth the hassle. Trust me.

  I was pretty skeptical about buying an air fryer.  When they first came out I laughed and thought they would be a novelty for a year and then folks would move on.  It's been a few years and I decided to pull the trigger.  Lots of research and I landed on the Cosori.  This thing is big and holds a lot.  Everything I have made so far has been great.  Broccoli, salmon, burgers, chicken - you name it.  I really love cooking Salmon in this thing.  Turns out perfect every single time. And I avoid heating up the house using the oven.  It's less shiny plastic looking if you want to leave it out on the counter.  Pretty easy to clean as well.  This thing is a game changer, kicking myself for not buying it sooner.

  Literally has changed the way I/we eat. I eat steaks at home now ($5 ribeyes from the grocery store) that tastes great! Way different than the bland taste from the oven. hard to explain why, but there is a big difference. Plus, we do the frozen Kroger burgers and they're great as well. No after-taste, and just basic burger tastes as it should. But putting the bun on top for the last 30 seconds or so makes the difference as well, kind of crispy, warm bun with mayo, lettuce, etc and it's a THOUSAND times cleaner and easier to make than the skillet, where grease goes everywhere, plus the waste of time it takes on stove. As they all say, the fries are DIFFERENT than when in oven, way better, the wya they taste at the restaurant, but better.This from a live-long drive thru and take out person. We've literally eaten more, and way better, and cheaper, at home in past month than ever. It's easy to give up 10-15 minutes to make a meal, vs the stove or oven where it takes prep, hour or whatever, then cleanup, not happening with me. Never use my oven, mainly because after all that work it never tasted good. Eveyrthing they say is true, it tastes different, and is really quick. frozen burgers and crinkle fries together at once, in 10 minutes - you're eating! and crinkle fries tastes the way crinkle fries in deep fryer tastes, but no grease. I don't even use the spray or anything, they still taste great to me!

  I didn't think I was going to be a big fan of air fryer until this product changed my opinion!  I thought air fryers are just for fried chicken, but actually, this item can be used to cook all kinds of food.  No matter it's steak, fish, wings, or even veggies.  Just put it in and let it be - it will become ready in minutes.  The cooked food tastes pretty similar to actual grilled food, but the clean up is much easier than a grill, and also air frying is much healthier than grilling.

    Arrived broken (TWICE)
  
",1.0,Raquel Padilla,"Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  Cleaned, plugged in, prepared to use. Turned on to see that 8 buttons are broken including the preheat and temp/time buttons. Only a few of the preset buttons are working. I've seen other reviews about how their first fryers arrived defective until they contacted customer support and got sent a new one. It should arrive working the first time. I will update after I contact them.UPDATE:It arrived in original packaging and taped up, similar to the first. Buttons work fine, however, the bottom of the air fryer does not completely push in or close, letting steam out the front. I've included pictures showing steam being released. If I push the handle in and hold it, the gap closes and steam is released from the back like it should. I believe it is a problem with the latch. The review will remain 1 star until I get one with no defects.UPDATE 2:I decided to keep it for a few days to test and see if the gap at bottom of the air fryer that was releasing steam would affect the product. To my dismay, in the middle of cooking chicken strips, the air fryer basket dislodged and shot across my counter, almost scattering my food around the kitchen. I looked in horror as the hot basket lay on my newly refurbished counter before quickly grabbing it and placing it on a heat resistant surface, wondering how, had I not been there watching intently, the damage could have been catastrophic. I am furious and I believe that receiving a faulty product twice, with the second one almost causing damage to my property and food, is not acceptable. Do not buy this product.

  This Cosori was purchased as a gift.  I own one exactly like it.  I have had it for about a year and haven't used my oven for a long time.  I have been able to enjoy fried chicken without the mess of cooking it or the guilt of eating it.  It is excellent for frozen potatoes as it is fast and makes them crispy like they were deep fried but not grease.  Fish is tasty and moist.  I really haven't found anything that doesn't cook easier and taste better in any other way. Crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside.  I highly recommend this fryer as it is efficient and easy to use.  Cleaning is a breeze.  When I dish up I fill it with hot soapy water and by the time I've finished eating it requires a swish and it is clean.  So happy I purchased it.

    Nice air fryer - little knob that would lock the removable drawer seem to wear off in time though
  
",4.0,Paul,"Reviewed in the United States November 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  Ease of use - well, I had to train myself to not press the power button again, which is very easy to do thinking that it is how you would start the machine. No, you need to press the button once to turn the machine on, and then press 'play' button above. At first, my hand will automatically turn the machine off instead of starting the air fryer cycle :)Functionality-wise, it is very good. Have no complaint so far.One thing I have noticed wit the drawer latch - drawer is secured by a little knob at the bottom which will find its place when you push it in. Over time, this will wear off and the drawer will not fit - and the air fryer will not turn on without it closed all the way. Called COSORI and they sent me a replacement - which did not yet develop same issue.Looking at the design though, that plastic knob looks like it will eventually wear off and will cause same issue.

I have used the dishwasher but was not satisfied with how clean it got.

  I habe been using the Cosori for a couple of weeks now and it was worth ever penny.  Great size, which was a must for me.  So far I have made fries (frozen), many chicken thighs and many, many chicken wings.  the Chicken thighs are so good, I find myself now craving them.  I spray them with a little oil, season with italian seasoning, salt and pepper, cook at 400 for about 15-20 mins and they come out delicious.  Skin gets as crispy as frying and juicy meat.  15-20 mins is decent speed for cooking bone-in thighs thoroughly.  Today I reheated wings I made yesterday and they were as crispy and juicy as fresh.  This is my first air-fryer, so i have a sample size of 1....but it is really hard for me to imagine other air fryers performing much better than this.  Clean up is a breeze, like most things, if you get to it when it's still hot.  Use pre-heat feature before cleaning if you want to put it off until after dinner.

  Overall I love this air fryer, I use it almost every single day.  It's so easy and fast to use compared to the oven, and it really makes food crisp.  I would've given it 5 stars, except for 2 things - the way the tray pulls out is a little clunky, you have to yank it out, it's not as smooth as it could be.  And if you tip it down the oil drips out the bottom of the drawer onto the counter which seems like is a fail somehow.  I had a smaller one before and I loved it but it wasn't big enough to make food more than 1 person so I upgraded to this one, but that one did not have these issues.  I would still not trade it in for another one because the overall cooking is great and looks very nice on the counter.  I use it to ""re-heat/re-fry"" fried chicken and it comes out better than when you first pick it up from the store, not to mention healthier because the oil drips out of it and it's less greasy.  I also love cooking artichokes in it, ready in 15 minutes, and I've never known how easy it can be.  Air-frying raw chicken breasts (not frozen) takes about 20-25 minutes and I've fit 2 huge size breasts in it to cook together, no oil needed, skin is crisp and meat is super juicy.  Fresh fries with just spray oil and salt, ready in 20 mins.  Brussel sprouts 15 mins.  Crisp turkey bacon and hash browns for breakfast 12 mins.  This white one also comes with extra tray and metal skewers so you can make your own meat or veggie skewers.  Everyone I've cooked for here is pleasantly surprised how well the food comes out and wants their own, so highly recommended.  The drawer is dishwasher safe so very easy to clean.One reminder is that it does put out a lot of heat, so you have to pull it away from your backsplash and other appliances when it's cooking.

  if you can't tolerate the smell of burnt plastic/metal all over your house then don't buy it. The smell well make you want to gag. I check everything and took the thing apart the best I could to find the cause of the burnt smell but I didn't find anything. I concluded maybe it is the coil itself. Anyway I leave it out in the patio and I cook outside too. The good part is the food does not absorb the burnt plastic/metal smell. the latch on the pan basket need a better design. Sometime it feel like I am going to break it wen trying to putting it back to the fryer.Update. 7/20.  Okay the metal/plastic smell been gone for months now.

  I'm very happy with this air fryer. I dragged my heels on buying one because I'm always buying kitchen gadgets and then never using them. I researched different styles and sizes watching YouTube videos and came up with this. I'm glad I got the 5.8QT. It's just my husband and I and the smaller size would have been to small for us as I'm cooking meals in it. I love how I can make a full meal in it. The pic I've included in this review I used a precooked chicken sausage sliced up, green beans, red peppers and red onions. Put in a bowl and I sprayed with olive oil spray. Then added salt, pepper and garlic powder and mixed it all together and dumped into the air fryer basket. Set at 390 for 12 minutes and shake every 3 minutes or so. I put in all on some fettuccine but rice works too. I also do this with shrimp or chicken strips and vary my seasonings. The only thing I've noticed is this is very powerful so I have to watch my cooking times and temps since I'm still learning. When done I put some soap and hot water to soak anything stuck for a few minutes. I put the basket part in the top rack of my dishwasher. So easy to clean!

  I've been wanting an air fryer for some time but have never found one that had good reviews AND a good price.  I took a chance with this when it came up for a sale price on the Amazon Treasure Truck, and I'm glad I did!This doesn't take up a lot of space on the counter.  It's square so you can fit more food into the pan too.  The digital controls on the front basically make this thing idiot proof, but a fair warning, the times on these settings will overcook your food.  I usually start with their setting and back down on the time and temp settings until I get it just the way I like it.  You can prepare an entire dinner right inside the basket.  It comes with a cookbook to get you started too.Clean up is easy.  Just put it in the sink and fill it with warm dish soap water and let it sit while you have dinner.  Then just wipe it out and it's done!This is great for the busy life that we all lead these days.  It makes eating a healthy, home-cooked meal quicker than running out and getting fast food.I am definitely a fan of this unit!!

  Update: December 2020 - Cosari reached out to me because of this review and after an email exchange they refunded me what I paid for the unit as an Amazon gift card because it was under warranty. Actually they offered me the choice of a refund or to put me on the list to send me a replacement as soon as they had new stock. Excellent customer service. I then bought the exact same model again (found another one on Amazon) and my new one does not have the issues with the freezing buttons I wrote about in my previous review. So in short I am very happy and am enjoying using the air fryer both through the control panel and the app (and Alexa).------------ Original review ---------------This one was a replacement for one that was a little bit bigger and would not fit where I wanted to stored it and it cooks just as (very) well. I do enjoy playing with the wifi/app control but would be the first to admit that it is a bit of a toy.What is not good and the only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 5 is that the buttons are not easy to push and register input. There often seems to be a short lag where it seems like the device is frozen taking the button input. This is pretty annoying as I often have to push a button multiple times to get it to register, even more so when you are changing time/temp so need multiple pushes to register, so I generally prefer to use the phone app to kick it off and adjust it. It is possible that mine is just a hardware dud where the senors for the buttons are misaligned with the buttons display, but that does not explain the input freeze behavior I am experiencing. My girlfriend hates using it and wanted me to return it.

  Bought this on prime day not knowing what an air fryer was but just knowing everyone and their mother has one and swears by them. After reading review after review saying “just buy it” I was convinced I NEEDED one in my life. My husband and I have literally cooked in it every single day since purchasing. The first thing I cooked was chopped up potatoes and my mind was blown when they were perfect in 10 minutes. Ever since, we’ve cooked everything from steaks to chicken to veggies to mini pizzas to breakfast sandwiches. It truly is a life changing thing to come home for lunch and just dump some stuff in the basket and have it ready in 10~15 minutes and still have time to enjoy a lunch break for once.I also really like the pre-set options. I noticed other hair dryers just have temp dials and idk how people who aren’t familiar with air fryers would figure that out so it’s nice to be able to just push a button and let ‘er go. The drawer is a little tough to get out at first until you get used to it. And the product photo is a little misleading and makes the screen look more high tech than it is. I posted photos of he actual screen as well as a size comparison photo to my standard stand mixer. We also really are happy with the recipe book it came with. So I have to join the others with saying “just buy it”.

  This is my 2nd air fryer. Loved the concept but hated that my old PowerXL was small...hard to clean...and had a round basket. After knowing what i DID want i found this! Excellent product. Have used non-stop since i received it after T'giving 2020. Easy to clean. Lots of menu selections almost too many. Trial and error. SQUARE BASKET tho? GENIUS! Made (4) 1/2 pound burgers at the same time and were better than grilled and not messy like pan fried! Highly recommend

When I inspected the basket - it was a screw that held the handle to it and it looks like whatever the screw screwed into failed as well because there's nothing there anymore - I was not able to locate the ""nut"" that held it in place.

  I had never had an air fryer and with all the reviews on Facebook I thought I would try this one. It has definitely been a learning curve as far as time to cook certain items. But having said that it is very convenient does not take up much space on my counter and the food in general is quite tasty after being cooked in this. I am retired and there are just two of us here so the size is perfect. I would say that if you have a larger family that this might not be the one you're looking for. I don't know if they make one bigger but they do stand by their product and even if you have a large family you could use it for things like french fries side dishes hamburgers that sort of thing.

  I recently got the air fryer and was excited to try it out. I’ve made chicken wings in it twice. My concern was that the chicken has a very distinct taste, that I’m sure came from the fryer. I washed it before using it and removed all the plastics, but I was totally creeped out by it. I recently tried it again and left some for my wife without mentioning the taste issue to her to see what she said and she had made a similar comment without being prompted, soooooooo I’m probably going to return if for a different brand.On the positive side, it was super easy to use and clean.

  I love my 5.8 qt Cosori Air Fryer.  I use it for almost all my meals and was saddened when the top screw fell out of the removable basket.  So I contacted Cosori, they immediately responded asking for some additional information and sent me a replacement basket.  Unfortunately, the basket didn't fit properly, so I emailed them again and immediately Adriana sent me an email telling me that they are sending me another replacement basket. That's customer service!  I forgot to hit the submit button, so now I'm adding a second experience with them.  My unit was purchased on October 19, 2019, and the experience about the lost screw occurred in June of 2020.  Now I'm experiencing the air fryer turning off suddenly, and when I close the basket, it continues cooking for the remaining time.  I wrote Cosori thinking that since it's more than a year old, nothing would happen, but instead after sending them proof of purchase and an ID number, Elijah wrote back and said they are sending me a replacement unit.  I love my air fryer and  use it all the time.  I don't know if I'll have to check to see if I need to tighen the screws that hold the air fryer handle  to the basket, but perhaps they have fixed the issue.  In any case, kudos to Corsori Customer Service.

  I never thought I'd want an air fryer after buying an instapot and never using it more than 2 times before reselling it. That being said, this air fryer life is addicting! Holy cow! My husband keeps volunteering to cook with it too, which he normally never cooked unless it involved a pot of water. He even wants to but a second one and we haven't even owned it for 3 weeks, so we can cook the main meal and a side at the same time. I researched air fryers for a couple months on all different sites and am so happy I chose this one. I was a little unsure because I hadn't heard of the Cosori brand before this bur the reviews were right, this one is awesome.

  I chose this air fryer based on my neighbor’s positive experience with hers, and I am very pleased with my purchase. My initial frustration was similar to most users, which was The difficulty in getting the touch screen to respond. It took a handful of tries, but now I never have a problem with the buttons because I learned that the touchscreen only requires a light touch. Most people, myself included, mash buttons on their electronics and this Cosori air fryer does NOT like that. I use my air fryer everyday instead of the oven and get excellent, sometimes even better results! Roasted potatoes and roasted brussel sprouts are way better in the air fryer, compared to my oven. I used the suggested settings in the included Cosori recipe booklet and they come out perfect every time. For cubed, marinated baked tofu, I use the “shrimp” setting and they are a favorite at our house now. However, I prefer to use airfryercalculator.com to manually adjust temperature and time for frozen foods I cook in this air fryer as I found the Cosori presets made the food a bit too fried/crunchy/browned. I usually pick a preset on the air fryer that is closest to the temperature that I want to use and then adjust according to the online calculator. Don’t forget to flip or shake your food half way through cooking! I also love the “keep warm” setting to keep my foods hot and crispy (instead of taking it out and making things soggy) while I finish up the rest of my meal on the stove. Cleaning is very straightforward, and I would also recommend checking the inside heating coil for any food particles that may have blown around during previous cooking to prevent creating a burning smell. I also suggest lining the drawer with aluminum foil before snapping the fryer basket inside to make clean ups even easier. This air fryer is great for the price point and I would certainly recommend this to the rest of my friends, and you too if you’ve read this far =)

  I'd heard about air fryers for a while but had never really looked into them before. I always found them to be synonymous with infomercials and didn't really think they could be very useful. Then my wife started talking about how'd she'd been seeing her favorite food bloggers using them and how she thought she might like one.I ended up getting this Cosori for her b-day and it's now her favorite kitchen appliance and mine. We eat a lot of chicken and the air fryer makes the best ""fried"" chicken I've had and it's so incredibly simple. We typically add nothing but a little salt and press the chicken button and that's it. We've made it for multiple friends and family members and have gotten raving reviews as well. We've also done sweet potato fries, fresh broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, and a few other veggies, we even tried making some cookies in it.We've transported it on multiple occasions as well, bumping it into things here and there and it's held up incredibly well besides the couple scuffs and scratches. The cleanup is incredible btw, so simple and quick. The nonstick surfaces on the tray make it super easy to quickly scrub and wipe down. One last thing I'll say is that I'm glad we didn't go any smaller than this. It does take up a good chunk of counter space but it's nice being able to do enough in one batch to feed the 2 of us and then have some leftovers as well.

  I reluctantly bought this device because my wife insisted she wanted one. Researched showed me this was a good mid-size unit and it had some great features - like Alexa integration. We got it, and I believe we have used it every day in one capacity or another. The normal stuff you would expect - like frying - works well. We found some frozen breaded shrimp that are good, some healthy frozen egg rolls, etc. We never take home left over french fries from a restaurant, but this will perk them (and onion rings) back up to their original flavor. We baked salmon in this device to perfection. Preheat, 8 minutes, let it set for 5 after cooking - and PERFECTION. Reheating bread is amazing. We have a nice Italian restaurant that we will carry out from occasionally. But by the time we get home with the meal, the warm wrapped bread is soggy and yucky. Preheat the Air Fryer for 4 minutes to 360, cook for about 5 minutes, and it is just like it came fresh out of the over.I'm a believer.....

  first off let me say this was the first air fryer I owned. it works as you would expect and I did get a lot of cooking out of it over the year and a half but unfortunately that's no more. I went to pull out the tray after it was pre-heated & out of nowhere the handle melted off from the tray itself I touched it (carefully of course ) to make sure it didn't snap off or I missed used it in some way but the plastic was hot and can see where it began to warp. will follow up if there is a temporary fix to it because it would be really unfortunate to throw away such an expensive kitchen product so quickly.with that said it cook great very easy to use I found that experimenting with the times and temps you will get better results than what was pre-programmed into it didn't use all the functions mainly my own cooking times and temp so all the bells and whistles aren't that important. the cleaning I found to be very annoying the basket is easy and so is the drip tray but the basket walls are where you run into problems you can soak it scrub it spray it but the crevices are so narrow and so many you won't really get it 100% clean & that's okay to an extent because I will know myself that my products aren't completely clean I'm not satisfiedIf I can't fix the product myself then I (WILL NOT) be buying it again unfortunately just for it to happen again.

    BEST Air Fryer Out There!
  
",5.0,R. G. Confer,"Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2019","









  
  
    
  Having owned most of the other brands out there on the market, I must say that this Cosori model is my favorite and the best working of all of them.The non-stick surface is so easy to clean and it even does not stick without adding extra non-stick spray to the surface. The controls are very easy to use and react promptly when touched.There are several features in this air fryer that I have not seen in others. My favorite would be  the frozen food button preset. If you select the frozen food preset you can adjust the time and temperature to your desire for your particular food type. Once you press the start button, the food will begin to cook and halfway through the elapsed time, the machine will beep and remind you to turn the food. This provides for very even cooking. Although I have found that certain items such as chicken wings I did not even have to turn and they browned on both sides efficiently.If you want a great air fryer and don't want to go through 10 other brands before you find one that works for you, I would suggest buy this one first. It really is an awesome air fryer!

Ordered the extra assessories that they offered, and prepared a hot dog for my husband for lunch using the skewers/& rack.  He thought it was tasty, but commented there wasn’t a lot of difference than in microwaving it.  Then i cooked up some French fries and they were crisp and perfect!  The clean up thus far seems to be easy, and the operation and directions, simple and easy to understand.  The unit seems sturdy and well made!  There is a great cookbook that is included with your purchase and looks like we will enjoy trying out different recipes.  There is only one DISAPPOINTMENT for me, and that is, when cooking the French fries there is suppose to be a “shake reminder”, this function did not work.  Other than that, we are thrilled with our Cosori Air Fryer, and would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for an incredible air fryer!

It’s large enough to cook for my family of five in it and it doesn’t take up too much space it get really hot when using it. There was a weird smell when i first turned it on but i just preheated it and washed it again (after it cooled) and it was gone. I put foil in it when I’m feeling lazy so there no cleanup but i think it works best it u don’t use anything other than a little oil because the air needs to get around the food and with the holes blocked at the bottom it can only make one side crispy at a time. That’s fine with me when I don’t feel like cleaning up.

  My husband did some online research before we bought an air fryer.  This one is the one he settled on, so we ordered it.  It worked perfectly for a couple of weeks, then the digital display went completely berserk.  I contacted Cosori directly through their customer service.  I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised.  They asked me to supply them with a few numbers off our fryer, and a picture of what the display looked like.  That was it.  I had a new one so quickly I couldn't believe it.  This one has never had a hiccup.  I cooks bacon better than anything I've ever used.  Frozen onion rings, corn dogs for the grandkids - I love it!  Cleanup is so easy.  The grease basin and the food tray come apart and they are both dishwasher safe.  However, they are so easy to wash that I seldom put them in the dishwasher.  One of the things I like best about it is that the frying tray is square.  Many of the air fryers I looked at had odd shaped trays.  I am not a fan of kitchen gadgets.  I don't like appliances lined up on my counter.  This is an exception.  I use it every day, so it IS on my counter all the time.  It's quite attractive, so I don't mind.  If you are in the market for an air fryer please consider Cosori.  I'm very happy with mine.

  This is a great air fryer to use, had it for over a year and mostly use it for salmon/fries/chicken related products. Can definitely be used for a variety of different things, though cooking time will vary a lot. I wouldn't really recommend anything battered to be cooked in it since it takes a very long time to crisp up and doesn't taste as good as a deep fried (which is expected but was still worth a shot). Once you find your preferred timing, the rest is simple with only 1 flip in between during the half way mark. My only complaint is that cleaning the basket by hand (great if you use a dishwasher though)!The reason I give this a high rating is the customer support. My basket ended up breaking the handle and making it useless and I didn't sign up for the extended warranty as it was a gift to my mom and didn't see it. After contacting customer support, they were happily willing to send another replacement basket free of charge despite being out of warranty. I very much appreciate a company willing to work with the customer and stand by their products, hence why I highly recommend Cosori as a brand, whether you get this one or a newer version!

  I love this fryer.  It's easy to clean and easy to use.  It gets the job done.  My issue is a safety concern.  Every time we used the fryer, we would smell a strong plastic smell.  We assumed this was from just ""breaking the product in.""  Then, one day, I decided to move the fryer to a different location in my kitchen.  The fryer had been in front of the window blinds in my kitchen.  The blinds melted from the heat being released from the rear of the fryer!  I had never head this issue with the previous fryer I had in the same location.  I looked at the manual and it only mentions to avoid sticking your hands near the ventilation area.  I would there should be a warning in bold letters to not place the fryer in front of any materials that could melt or burn.  I'm assuming everyone is placing the fryer on a countertop in front of a wall of some kind.  Depending on the finish on that wall, this could be a huge fire hazard.Anyway, we moved the fryer to an area where we have a tile backsplash only.  I'm sad my blinds on my new house are ruined.The product itself is great as long as you are mindful of what building materials are behind the fryer.

   We use it almost everyday. It’s easy to use, easy to clean, gives me fantastic fries, crunchy deep fried pork, and beautiful browned chicken.UPDATE:My Cosori Airfryer suddenly stopped working after two months of use.After initially using is quite often, we slowed down to a once a week usage after a week or two as the novelty of deep fried food died down.

So this particular appliance, being only two months old and breaking down in such a short span of time is unacceptable.

  These are the next best thing since a kuerig.  So convenient so fast so easy to clean.  Forget the microwave for leftovers use this to reheat,  The food tastes way better doesn't get rubberized or mushy.  Biggest thing to watch for is drying something out like bread, its easy to dry breads out.  Fix your stale chips in this it can be done.  Leftover french fries are now a thing, before I tossed them or gave them to the dogs.  Quesadilla, grilled cheese, steak, fish, bacon, bagels, all sorts of leftovers.  For reheating and cooking I would recommend this over a microwave any day.  A microwave can heat water better and faster, that's IT!  By By hotpocket sleeves if you use this, takes a little longer but you get an actual crispy hot pocket.  Play with the heat and times, the presets are just a general guide and won't work for everyones preferences,  or quantities.  Haven't burned anything yet either the way this heats it takes a bit to burn something.

    Questionable Quality Control
  
",1.0,J. McVeigh,"Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  I decided to give this air fryer a try due to its very high ratings on Amazon and c|net labelling it as the 'best overall air fryer'.  I recall being conflicted on choosing the dial-driven manual vs. touch button electronic version of this device due to quality concerns but opted to go with the touch one for preset convenience.  I should have listened to my gut.The first device came and only 4 of the 18 buttons worked.  I looked up videos of other people operating the device and immediately knew mine was broken when I saw how easily others pushed each button and had the machine respond.  Thinking I just had some bad luck I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement the next day.  I didn't even unpack the next one completely before turning it on and trying the touch screen buttons to see if it worked as expected.  This time 6 of the 18 buttons worked so I boxed it up and requested a refund.One broken device is understandable as manufacturing issues occur sometimes, but two back to back makes me think this company doesn't have very good quality control standards.  If you want to order this machine I would learn from my mistakes and go for the manual version, but personally I will be looking at a different company altogether for my air fryer.  I feel you will be rolling the dice to see if you get a good product or a broken one with this company.Very disappointing...

  I have heard the hype about Air Fryers and had a delicious piece of salmon that was prepared in this brand and model, at a friend's house. I immediately ordered this Air Fryer. One of the buttons on the touch panel didn't operate correctly from the beginning and it was taking about double the amount of time both from recipe times and the pre-sets.I returned this after a couple of days of using it- pretty sure I was done with the Air Fryer. But, alas... it makes cooking much easier and it doesn't heat up the entire oven, kitchen, house! Clean up is a sinch, food turns out pretty good.I ordered another brand- 3 times the cost(!!). I look forward to seeing if it provides better results.

  This air fryer is easy to use and has become a daily fixture in our kitchen. It has held up well to daily use with the exception of one thing. The original inner basket that came with it gave me problems. The screws kept backing out of the handle making for a dangerous situation anytime I lifted/moved it. I was constantly tightening the screws. At one point the basket got knocked off the counter and the clips that hold the inner basket into the outer basket broke off so I had to replace it anyway. The new inner basket has given me no trouble whatsoever so I'm not sure if the one I originally had was defective or what. Despite all that, I recommend this air fryer! It has a large basket that holds a lot of food at one time. I'm able to cook for my family of 4 in it. It is so much easier than heating up my oven and my family prefers the taste of the food from the air fryer.

No problem and they were better than oven baked!We have found that if you read the instructions completely the oven works great.  Let's face it, this is a small convection oven.  It is not an oil deep fryer.  Before you get it read the questions and answers.  We learned a lot of valuable tips, the best being not to put it in the dishwasher!  Warm water and dish soap are all you need.  Always preheat, Cosori tells you that for a reason and your results will be better.Those little aluminium cake and loaf pans you buy in the market work great in this.We have a lot of good cooking ahead of us and this little appliance will sure make it easier!

  Before anything else, i bought this product about a year ago and have been using it happily since. It works amazingly and cooks food perfectly with the pre-set settings. Fully frozen chicken breasts get cooked in no time and i have an easy and healthy dinner.Now then, Onto the customer support experience! I had to deal with them twice so far. First happened on day one, i had a rare issue of the product being defective. I unpacked it and cleaned it as directed, plugged it in, and it turned on, then 5-10 minutes later, it would just power down for no reason and not come back on. Using their book i figured out it was over-heating for some unknown reason as if i let it cool down for a half hour or so, it would turn on and go back to  working seemingly like normal then after another 5 minutes of trying to pre-heat, would shut off again. I was upset and decided to try calling the Cosori customer support rather than going through amazon. The people at their support center worked with me for a few minutes trying to diagnose the problem and came to the conclusion, it was defective. They immediately offered me a replacement and sent it out, 2 day shipping, completely free of charge as they should. The key here is they didn't try to accuse me of breaking the thing, or anything else. They did everything they could to help then when they couldn't they offered to make it right. The new one arrived and has been working flawlessly  until today. During regular cleaning a screw fell out of the basket. When i tried to see where the screw was supposed to go, a nut fell out of the handle as well. I'm assuming the screw went into the obvious hole in the basket, and locked into that nut which was buried somewhere inside the handle. The issue here is there's no easy way to put this nut back into place. I couldn't take the handle apart past a certain point, and the nut had to be inserted inside the handle somewhere for the screw to then attach. I called Cosori support again and explained my issue hoping they could just walk me through putting the thing back together as i figured they must know a way. After hearing what i said they didn't even bother trying to fix it, just apologized for the the basket breaking and offered to send me a replacement basket.  I was stunned and agreed. I received an email from them , provided my order details, and my replacement basket will be on the way soon.  These people bend over backwards to help you and stand by their product and its so rare to find a company willing to do that. This product alone worked great, but whats really selling me on their brand is their customer support. I can safely buy their stuff and know its going to work right, and if it doesn't they are going to work with you and do everything they can to make it right.  Cannot recommend them enough and will continue to buy Cosori products in the future.

  We had a smaller Ninja Fryer we loved. Built like a tank and easy to use and clean. We saw this unit as we needed somersetting a  little bigger and with all the good reviews ordered it. The unit feels a little cheap, maybe it is the fingerprint proof plastic coating. The controls are not as granular around timing as the Ninja. The cooking baskets also come across cheap and rough making cleaning by hand difficult. The coatings on the basket as not as non-stick as the Ninja. In the end it gets the job done, but I don't see this as a long term ownership as we will likely look at other alternatives in a  few months.

  I have had this machine for about 2 weeks now and I love it.  It revitalizes left overs,  giving a crispiness that cannot be achieved in the microwave and you do not have to heat your entire oven to warm a few things.  The 5 min pre-heat is an excellent feature which I could not find on many competitor models.  Last night my 16 year old son cooked tomato, provolone, and basil stuffed chicken breasts... they were tender and juicy in a way I have never gotten from cooking in the oven and they took a fraction of the time to cook. The large basket size allows for easy cooking for my family of 4 with room to spare.  I am still learning the settings, but I am more comfortable with it after every use.  I could see this replacing not only my deep frier but my oven for many meals! It has a smaller footprint than my current 1/2 gallon deep frier and I think it will get a coveted counter top storage place as I can see us using it so much that it would be pointless to keep putting away.

Next week I will try to make crispy fried chicken. Anyway this air fryer will eliminate my other gagets....*******UPDATE*****, I've had the fryer for 4 weeks now, and it is better then my other devices. The cooking time on some food items, vary a lot. The recipe book photo are very professional so don't have that expectation, yours will look that ""GOOD"" ..... ok.... Be prepare for trial and error for cooking times on some items. Finally the disappointing issue.....the basket with the vents at the bottom and sides are very hard to clean, especially the side vents. I don't use any abrasive material to clean it and I don't have a dishwasher. Hand washing with dish soap, even letting it sit in hot water over night, does not help to clean the side vents. Because of the difficult time to clean the inner basket, I need to lower the rating. It is a good fryer and probably better then most fryers, but the effort to clean it is a challenge.

And whenever I get Chinese take out, with egg rolls, etc., I place the egg rolls in this for 2-3 minutes and it heats and crisps them up incredibly well --- just like getting them fresh at the restaurant.

  So I love using the AirFryer, it is my favorite cooking appliance now...  but that makes it worse that the handle snapped off of the basket.  This must be a common design flaw because even though it is in warranty there are no replacement baskets available from the manufacturer and even Amazon only has used baskets for sale.As for the Airfryer, it cooks well and cleans up very easily.Digital touch screen is annoying, I can see why the manual knobs option has come back.  The buttons have a delay between touching it and changing the settings so something as easy as changing the temp and time is bothersome (you have to go through temp to get to time).The App on the phone works well, and is good for alerting you if you are running the fryer and leave the room.  The App also has good recipes and is easier to use than the digital display to set temp and time.

    A life-changing air fryer.....

  I cook 90% in my Cosori air fryer...10% stove, oven, & microwave.  Love this thing & wish I’d  known about it a long time ago!!  Can preheat it, then throw my son’s French toast sticks in for 2 mins on a busy morning....boom!! Bfast.  Pizza reheats like a dream.  Dumplings, burgers, & bacon all crisp up super nice & of course the restaurant leftovers, including fries taste like they were made fresh again.  It sounds cliche, but this machine is life-changing for our family.  Made some amazing bacon-wrapped tomato & asparagus.  Getting ready to try spring rolls soon.  The only oil I ever used, was a bit drizzled on the fresh russet fries & that was mostly for a bit of seasoning/flavor.  The ‘Shake’/ flip food feature that beeps part-way through cooking is genius & helps it all get really crispy.  Can’t wait to start using my baking accessories for it.  The racks are so darn handy to keep food from sticking to foil I lined in my fryer basket.  So worth another appliance taking up counter space....,can’t live w/out it now!!!

  I've used this Air Fryer the past week, and right from the start it had issues. The Time/Temp touch button doesn't seem to work well. Have to press it like 8 times, and you use it alot to set the cooking temp and time. Also, there is a strong plastic smell after the first cooking. A week later and the unit continues to produce a burned plastic smell that stays in the house for hours. As far as cooking, we done a variety of food, including steak, and I've noticed that most foods don't get done well inside and isn't nice and hot, even though it's done on the outside. I don't have this issue when using the oven range or outside grill. For the price, I would expect better cooking results, the touch pad to work for all buttons, and not a burning plastic smell. What's interesting is that other reviews have said the same issues with the touch pad and plastic smell. So I'm returning this and may look to try another brand.

  Oh my goodness, I am astounded by how awesome this thing is! The first recipe I tried with this air fryer is one of my favorites but is also one of the most temperamental. I love fried tomatoes but as anybody knows, unless they are green, then the tomatoes often fall apart in the cooking process. I am entirely impressed with how well this device performed. The tomatoes came out absolutely perfect with a golden crust and not overcooked in the middle. I also decided to throw in some fresh basil to see what happens, and it came out as a wonderful crispy topping. I highly recommend this air fryer because it has outperformed my expectations.

  I got this for my son for Christmas. He's 13. He loved it. He likes to cook and bake. It's a nice treat when he makes recipes from the booklet that came with it. The whole family enjoys eating the food he makes with it. It is easy to set up, operate and clean. He uses the parchment liners, so clean up is very quick. I didn't get the accessories that are universal and I don't think I will. They look like added kitchen clutter that would be used once and be annoying to clean. We have a tiny kitchen and have very limited space for kitchen stuff...like 3 or 4 cabinets that aren't huge for all of our kitchen cooking/baking/food storage items, so if you have a small kitchen you really gotta love this appliance, because it does take up space and create heat. We just plug it in and put it on the glass stove top usually, so the heat is in an area that is already made for it. We haven't tried it out on the counter yet, so be aware that if you put it on the counter, the hot air comes out the back. After he wipes it down and dries it, he just tucks it away in the cabinet when he's done with it.  As far as noise goes, it does generate noise but it isn't any louder than when we use the kitchen exhaust venthood. We have had it in use weekly since Christmas, so time will tell how long lasting it is. Look forward to trying new recipes with it.

  Right from the first day I loved the cooking ability of this cooker however I didn't like the handle and plastic clamp.  We've used the fryer about 8 time.  TODAY, would have been #9 but I started the machine and was talking to my kids when the tray AUTO ejected from the machine.  I was standing near so I instinctively reached for the tray in mid-air.  It seared my left index finger so bad by the time I turned my hand over I had 2nd degree burns.  The inside tray crashed on the floor sending our last batch of chicken nuggets (kids lunch) onto the floor.  Not only did it ruin our lunch it burnt my hand so bad I am typing this with one hand.  Needless to say this device has flaws that need fixed.  Wasted $120.

  ***Update from 6 months later: STILL using this air fryer every day! It’s so durable, but even so i take very good care of it to keep it that way. I hand wash the basket after every use and only put in the dishwasher once a month to keep the stainless coating intact. I also bought parchment filters that work great on baked goods especially. So happy with my purchase!***I love this air fryer so much! I use it every single day. I make egg bites or French toast sticks for breakfast, chicken nuggets and fries for lunch, and lamb meatballs or pizza for dinner. It makes dessert too! Easy quick chocolate chip cookies.I had an Instantpot brand air fryer before this and was disappointed how the top rack burned the food and the bottom rack didn’t cook at all.

  Got this for my husband. He loves it. In fact he can’t stop talking about what he wants to make.  He uses it 4 or 5 times a week to cook dinner or breakfast. He says it is very easy to clean. He likes it because he doesn’t have stovetop splatters to clean up like when he uses a frying pan. I like it because he uses less oil when he cooks. I also love that he likes using it so much.It does take getting use to and it’s easy to over cook items if you aren’t careful but after some use you will learn how to judge time on cooking.

  This is my 4th airfryer.  My first was the GoWISE GW22621 4th gen which would be my 2nd favorite but it didn't fit as much in the basket because it was round and the teflon came off pretty quickly - gave it to my son.  Then I decided to go big and get the GoWISE USA 3.7-Quart 7-in-1 GW22621 - it was BIG and EXPENSIVE but it filled my house up with smoke and fat globules when I cooked bacon and I had to open the doors and windows.  The timer also didn't work correctly.  I returned it and got the Cosori because of the reviews and price.  I have had it for about 2 months now and I couldn't be happier.  it has a nice sized square basket that you can place more food in with more surface area to crisp it.  I have cooked lots of items in it and am very happy with the results.  Steaks are phenomenal ... well so is the hamburgers and chicken with a great mallard affect but still moist in the middle.  Bacon is amazing and cleanup is a breeze.  I enjoy the fries and have even made an impressive and delicious calzone with a ww 2 ingredient dough that was the best I have eaten anywhere.  Enjoy this air fryer immensely!  The last air fryer I got was the ninja which also is pressure cooker etc.  I do enjoy this as well but cooking surface is much smaller and so prefer the corsori over the ninja if all you are looking at is the air fryer - get a instant pot with it and you'll be happy and have all the latest kitchen gadgets that makes preparing meals easy and flavorful.

  We’ve had our air fryer less than a month and I’m using it almost every night to cook our dinner. I wasn’t familiar with using an air fryer, but the booklet that came with the fryer was easy to follow. I bought the larger size (5.8 qt), even though there are just two of us. My reasoning was that we sometimes cook additional food in order to have leftovers and, secondly, because I wanted to be able to cook enough to feed our daughter as well when she comes over.The first meal I cooked was thick lamb chops. I marinated them a bit and easily fit all four in the fryer. I followed the cooking time in the recipe book and they were absolutely perfect! Browned on all sides, exactly the right temperature, tender, and delicious. Next, vegetables. I usually roast them in the oven and get them super crispy and browned. I was skeptical the fryer would be able to replicate this, but I was wrong- Brussels sprouts, asparagus, broccoli, squash- all perfect. Another outstanding meal was boneless chicken breast- dredge in a little panko and flour, egg wash, and into the fryer (no oil needs, but did spray the breasts with Pam). They were incredibly moist and wonderful. Also did chicken wings- another winner! Salmon, halibut- no problem.Cleanup is very easy- we do not put ours in the dishwasher. The basket and tray are very easy to wash out. I use the recipe book that comes with the fryer as well as a couple of others I ordered online. I supplement with an internet search when I don’t see what I want in one of the books. Of the books I have, I think the book that came with the fryer is pretty good. I highly recommend this air fryer.

Actually I've only begun to explore and dig in to actually reading and deciding on some of the recipes feature in it's accompanying cookbook.....but am having a blast simply cooking basics in it!  I'm definitely on a learning curve---I started out very basic by simply cooking up some seasoned frozen hamburger patties, and they turned out excellent--nom, nom!  I definitely signed up for the extended warranty, but I feel that i may not need to use it---no issues at this point, with my Cosori. It is easy enough to clean, but I did go ahead and purchase some parchment paper mats for its pan, as a way of protecting the pan, because I want to keep my air fryer in tip-top shape.  I do follow all the instructions concerning it, and make sure that it's has room around it for it to ""breathe"" and not become overheated.  All in all, I really don't know why I waited as long as I did to finally treat myself to an air fryer.

I found a replacement screw and tightened the old ones and the new one and all was well.  Today the basket that fits in the fryer tray is stuck.  The mechanism that releases the basket from the fryer tray broke.  I can't find any way to take it apart to see if I can fix it.  So, I guess this is really just a rental.  You pay about $100 per year to use it, then you throw it away and but a new one.  :(

  Looking for a way to enjoy all the foods I love in a healthier way, I had been curious about the air fryer for a long time. I first ordered a smaller one and sent it back, there was just no way, unless your single to make all the great recipes and food. So glad we ordered a large one. I was worried that I was just buying into another kitchen appliance that would not get used as much as it should and take up space. I use my air fryer several times a week!! More than almost all my appliances! I have not had one thing I haven’t loved! It enhances the flavor of everything. There is nothing better than homemade French fries, and they come out just as good as when I use to deep fry them in Oil. All frozen food items are better. The uncooked tortillas from Costco, egg rolls, wings, I could go on and on. And I’m not even following new recipes, I’m just making the foods I’ve always made, better!Cons are it’s large, and it smells, not that the smell is bad, it just smells like an oven. I just didn’t expect such a strong smell coming from a smaller appliance.Great buy, fan for life.

  First of all I did so much research to buy the right air fryer because I wanted an easy to clean, non-stick, hassle free air fryer. The only difficult part was taking all the plastic out and separating the trays. It doesn't explain how to exactly put the trays back together, or which tray gets screwed to the handle. Yes, you need to remove screws in order to get a layer of plastic out from underneath the tray, and to screw the tray to the main handle. Everything else was extremely easy. Cooking is simple. Comes with a recipe booklet. Comes with easy to read instructions. As long as you keep it clean, its great!VERY IMPORTANT (well in my opinion), is to do the test run as it states in the manual. Great investment!!#1 air fryer bestseller on Amazon!  Definitely worth the bucks!

  The design of this unit is very thoughtful and pleasing. I particularly like: 1. The angled, and intuitive to use control panel; and 2. The essentially square shape of the basket(s), which makes it possible to cook fairly large items.  My only slightly negative comment relates to the ""operating manual"".  As a person who previously did very little cooking, it would have been helpful to me if the manual included more information/guidance re recommended temperatures and cooking times. For example, what temperature and cooking time is appropriate for a small ham, a salmon filet, a fish filet, etc.

  Size: It's not to big or small. You can use amazons virtual feature to see if it fits where you want to put it. The basket is a great size! I was able to fit 13 chicken legs in with comfort and cooked perfectly.Cleaning: Cleaning the outside is as simple as taking a clean sponge or clorox wipes or whatever you use and wiping down real quick. Cleaning the internal cubby where the basket goes is easy as well. Quick wipe and all clean. Recommend using cleaning wipe. Omg the basket is dish washer safe! But if you don't have dishwasher, use rubber sponge or non abrasive sponge to clean it up ( so you don't scratch it). Takes about 5 min to clean, super easy.Cooking: you don't need egg- flour wash, if you want good fried food. If you do, it just comes out even better! I made pork chops and bacon; soooo good! As you see, super crispy and omg so juicy. When cooking in it, it keeps the meat juicy all the way through but nice crispness.Ease of use: super easy, instructions and recipe book are huge help!  There are so many recipes to try. Unfortunately,  you may have to screw in the screw tight once or twice because it comes loose. The wifi one is amazing ! I can preheat my food or start it all from my app. So nice when I'm trying to.vlean ir study and don't want to burn food or over cook it. Lol great for weightloss! 20lbs down! Overall, I would by again and recommend!

  Newest Addition to my list of favorite loud things!• Harley Davidson – Loud pipes save lives!• Fast Cars – None of that frooo frooo electric jive. We’re talking dino-sauce drinking sexy horsepower!• The super majestic North American Bald Eagle – 8ft wingspan of pure ‘MERICA coming for you• ROCKK AND ROLLLL – if it’s too loud, you’re too old• Guns, Guns, and more guns – Come and Take ‘em• My childhood dog – yeah, it was a poodle. Shut up – he’d bite your arse if you looked at him wrong• Al freaking Pacino – He’s not yelling, you’re just not listening quietly enough• The Cosori Max XL 5.8qt air fryer of the future – food never tasted so damn loud or delicious!A few weeks ago, the spouse and I (me and the spouse??) were out practicing some delicious social distanced dining. The food was great, cost a lot, and I instantly lost a belt loop. While suffering the inevitable food coma, I looked at the wife and said, “there’s got to be a better way to eat well and not turn the Covid-19 into the Covid-46.” After a few minutes on the Google researching better ways of preparing food, we landed on air fryers. Next step, off to Amazon to see how quickly and easily I can fill a need that I didn’t know I had. A few options down, I landed on the Cosori Max XL – PRIME eligible & a “best seller,” SOLD.Early the next week, I pulled the biggest box out of the daily pile of AMZ packages. The Cosori had landed. After a few more PowerPoint decks, a spreadsheet, and the accompanying conference calls, I heard a very strange (and loud) noise coming from the kitchen. Intrigued, I politely yelled, “WHAT THE HELL IS THAT NOISE?” A miffed voice replied, “the new air fryer.” Weird, but whatever. Closed the door, finished the day, and waddled out to test the results…The first meal that came out of the air fryer was a delicious meal of marinated chicken breasts, “fried” mushrooms, and some green beans. Skeptical as I was, it was time to eat. Let me just say, it was love at first bite. Despite the ruckus, this thing turns out delicious food, and it does it at light speed. Within the first week, we’ve used it to cook chicken, mushrooms, green beans, bacon, sweet potato fries, and cheese sticks. Thus far, it’s batting ~.900 with the only outlier being some lame arse pre-fab cheese sticks from “TGI Fridays” – my fault for buying them in the first place….FRAT version – the Cosori XL …. Quickly turns out delicious meals in a fraction of the time, calories and fat content. Better still, it’s ridiculously easy to clean. Yes, it’s a bit loud. However, once you fall in love with it, that noise transforms from annoyance to a preview of a great meal. Highly recommended – get some.

",4.0,Olivia,"Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  This air fryer is easy to use and makes great-tasting fried food but there are some flaws. In order to thoroughly clean the basket, you need to unscrew three screws (they help hold the draining tray and basket together). None of the reviews mentioned that and I was extremely disappointed to find out about this when I received the product. Also, beware that when you initially use the air fryer, it will release a plastic smell (which is apparently normal?). The plastic smell will disappear after a few usages but just so you are aware before you purchase the product!

  This is a really great appliance. We’ve had other air fryers in the past, but moved to this one due to its size. This unit is able to cook evenly and thoroughly. We opted for the WiFi version which, in my opinion seems a bit useless. We’ve used it a few times, but at the time of purchase, it was the cheaper option for some reason. Fast forward to 3 months later. We accidentally dropped the basket, and the lower basket assembly broke. We contacted the company to purchase a replacement basket, and they shipped one to us at no charge. Really great customer service. Without a doubt, would recommend this appliance.

  This is the best counter appliance I’ve ever bought and I’ve bought more than I care to admit. The ONLY negative is that it’s a big black box on our kitchen counter and so the attractive feature is a little less than ideal but that said, it’s super lightweight and easy to move to the pantry shelves when company comes over.Apparently this model is larger than most which is great and cleaning couldn’t be easier. You just pull out the non-stick basket and either pop in the dishwasher or clean with a quick rinse. Takes less time than it would to clean a roasting pan. So far I’ve baked chicken breasts (with skin, without skin, breaded, non-breaded), toasted bread, roasted baby carrots and green beans and brussel sprouts, sausages, baked potatoes, and made regular and sweet potato fries. All of it has turned out perfectly. The chicken moist, the french fries crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, the veggies all with a nice dark brown roast like we prefer. Even the chicken breast without skin or oil turned out moist and tender. Since getting our air fryer I haven’t used our oven and have only used the warming feature on the microwave to hold the cooked meat while cooking the vegetables. My only regret is that I didn’t buy an air fryer a long time ago

  I actually won an Instant Pot in a drawing. My husband and I both love it. When I was chatting with a colleague the other day, she mentioned that she loves her Air Fryer because she could vary her cooking from the steam cooking to the dry cooking that the Air Fryer has. I purchased Cosori on a Monday and it was at my door Wed morning. We made Coconut Shrimp on the first night. Loved it! Be sure that you wash the baskets prior to using for the first time. I made the mistake of not doing that and when I was preheating, the smell was awful. We stopped midstream and washed them both and it seemed to make a difference. Other than that...I'm looking forward to more cooking!

  I didn’t feel like I had a real “need” for an air fryer but I will say it makes things much easier. I’ve only fried chicken cutlets, breaded vegs and frozen snack foods in it but it works really well. Just check the timings of things- the chicken icon must be for pieces of chicken so time wise it’s much less for cutlets. I haven’t needed to use the remote option cause why would I? I’m in the kitchen preparing the rest of the meal while I use it. But if you’re in the fence - get it. You’ll thank me later.

One of the other things I really like is that you can easily adjust the temperature or the duration of cooking time which is a really good idea while you're learning to cook different things.

  I quite like this air fryer. I had a smaller dial-style model before. While I don't really use the bells and whistles on this one too much it has two major advantages over my old one. First, it has a greater capacity than the smaller one. Second- the lift-out basket is a game changer! Easy to clean. However, there are airflow holes in the plastic front of the basket where food crumbs can get trapped. That's my only complaint.[Amendment] After nearly two months of use, some glaring flaws have come to light with this fryer. First problem is this thing beeps so loud you'll wake your neighbors. Scares the pants off my poor dog. But the biggest issue is that the basket will NEVER be clean. Photo is after 15 minutes of hand-scrubbing. The angle of the side vents prevents scrubbers/sponges/rags from reaching spots. Enjoy cooking in a basket covered in rancid stuck-on grease!

  The manual explaining how to connect to the mobile app and Alexa is basically, just, wrong! So connectivity wise I'd give it one star. However it fries well, so I'll up my rating to three.To ACTUALLY connect to your app: 1. It does NOT use bluetooth, despite showing a bluetooth icon in the app and saying Bluetooth in the manual. Instead it uses Wifi, so find the Wifi network after pressing the button for 5 seconds. Go from there.You can NOT link to Alexa if you try to, from the app. Despite there being an option for it, and despite the manual saying that's how you do it. You have to start Alexa separately and detect the device from the Alexa app to get them linked. Do NOT start in side the VeSync app, it just ends up redirecting to a non-existent web page...

  This is my first air fryer which makes me pretty new to the usage.Cooking: I am happy with the outcome.Especially chicken drumsticks/breasts/tenderloins turned out to be extremely juicy and soft.French fries were not that great. Lot of uneven cooking. But may be I added too many in one batch.Since it has a cake as one of the presetting I baked a banana nut bread. The texture was good but I am not very great at baking, so not sure if I am the best judge for this feature.Also tried veggie patty which turned out good crispy on the outside and softer on the inside.Smoke:The back outlet emits too much smoke for each cooking. This makes the whole house smell of food. I have to leave one of windows open always when I am using the air fryer which is not very convenient!Smell:After 3-4 usages I realized along with the smoke their is a particular smell that is emitted. Something like when we reuse fried oil. I have been hand washing and then dishwashing both the containers after each use.I turned the air fryer upside down to check the coil which was pretty much greasy.Cleaning: Extremely extremely difficultTo get rid of the smell I cleaned the coil and the around surface using water and brush. This was extremely difficult because the coil cannot be removed and there is no way to reach the center or anywhere near the fan. So I guess even if I clean the around area of coil the smell issue is still going to be there for me.Because of the cleaning hassle I will certainly not recommend this product (even if it cooks well)!

  I actually ordered a different air fryer first from another company as a gift for my mom. While I'm sure that model would have been sufficient in it's own right, it turned out not to be quite what she was wanting, so I exchanged it and got this air fryer instead. To my pleasant surprise, it came much faster than I was expecting it would, and we put it to work that same day. We already had an air fryer cookbook (though this unit does come with it's own cookbook too) and made curried brussels sprouts for an after-dinner snack. Today we tried 'fried' cheese curds. Everything was simple and efficient to use (though we did find out that the display turns off when the baskets are removed - but it resumes again as soon as the baskets are reinserted). Clean-up is easy, and the digital display is clear and intuitive. I can see why this is so highly rated on here! I'm excited to see what other recipes we can try in our new gadget. (Next up: sweet potato fries when my aunt comes to visit.) It already has a permanent place of honor on our counter.

Our Cosori arrived last week and when we started it up, none of the buttons on the “touchscreen” worked when we touched them. Nothing. The only way we could work the device was through the app.  Figured it was defective and returned it to Amazon and received my replacement on Thursday. Just fired it up again and the same problem occurred. None of the buttons on the touchscreen work. We can’t turn it on, preheat, change the temperature EXCEPT when using the app.  This can’t be correct. How can this product advertise its easy to use  touchscreen when it doesn’t work?  It’s nice to be able to operate remotely, but I’d prefer to have a fully operational product. Not sure if Amazon has a bad batch of these, but we’ll buy a Ninja or Phillips instead next time.

  I'm not sure how this product has so many great reviews. First of all, the design is terrible. The button release is placed very horribly and you're likely to have an accident with it, and it will eventually break because it is cheap thin clear plastic.The pre-heat setting is garbage because after you have preheated it to the temperature you want, you will have to re-enter your cook time and temperature after it's done. It won't remember it. That is very frustrating. Food will either burn or not cook all the way.If you have a lot of patience and money to waste a lot of food to figure out which settings work best for what food, then go ahead and try this. Otherwise look elsewhere because I found it not worth it so far

    Awesome Smart Air Fryer
  
",5.0,Ryan Durkee,"Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I got this air fryer recently and have already used it a ton, it does a spectacular job heating up frozen foods while keeping a good crispy crunchy feel. I’ve tried a few of the recipes in the Cosori cookbook and they’ve all been great! The buttons on the fryer can be a little touchy, but other than that I have no complaints. I love that it’s dishwasher safe and the WiFi connection is nicer than you’d think. Specifically, I like that it sends me notifications when it’s done preheating or time to flip or when the foods ready, it makes it super easy to do other things while you wait for the food. Also, it’s nice to be able to preheat from my room with Alexa. The size of the tray is great too, the bigger the better.  I’ve cooked in a few other air fryers and It can be difficult to get a good cook with the smaller ones, and it’s certainly difficult to cook for more than one or two people in the smaller ones. I’d definitely recommend this fryer to anyone who wants a bit of a nicer fryer and with WiFi control as a bonus!

    Basket popping out while using, and even not using
  
",3.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  Product is great as far as cooking goes. Problem is basket always pops out. First when I got it just a couple of times. Now I have to put a weight  in front of it to keep it closed while I’m cooking. Totally at loss for words As to why I can’t cook on manual now that wi-fi is setup. Buttons don’t work.Anyway, since I forgot to hit send, “was wondering why I never received a response,” I’ll add this now: The other day, forgot to put weight in front of basket. Basket popped out again putting dinner on floor, AND TINY BITS OF PLASTIC BROKE OFF! Dented pan. Food had to be thrown away. I know I can’t send it back now because it is dented and chipped, If you want an air fryer that cooks good this is it!!! IF YOU DON’T mind the dents and chips you’ll get and going the “extra mile “ to ensure it doesn’t pop out. Or having a back up plan for dinner should your dinner end up on the floor and it was “JUST ABOUT READY”, THEN THIS IS THE ONLY FRYER YOU WILL EVER NEED UNTIL YOU GET FED UP WITH LOSING WHAT WS GONNA BE A GOOD DINNER

  I bought this in late October.About two months ago the screws started getting loose, I would retighten. As of two weeks ago two screws would no longer tighten and the basket stayed with one screw. Well tonight that screw randomly popped off while taking out my food and the baskets separated. Very annoying because some of my food fell. It’s only been a few months and I barley use it. Broke way to soon and this air fryer is expensive. So not worth it.

    Great air fryer and so much better designed than others we've tried.
  
",5.0,GB3,"Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  I replaced a larger air fryer with this one. Just from an engineering perspective -- this COSORI air frier is far and away a better option. The two-basket design which allows you to separate the inner basket from the outer one is so much more intelligent than the air fryer I had previously purchased which relied on an insert to keep food up and off the bottom of the basket. But the insert was removable and relied on seemingly nonfunctional silicon spacers which proved useless after only a few uses. You'd try to shake the basket to re-distribute food, and the insert would come loose requiring you to manually remove all of the food, and then re-seat the floor (bottom) of the basket. With the COSORI, the inner basket is completely removable from the outer basket making serving so much more convenient and when ""shaking"" the two baskets they stay together allowing for an easy redistribution of the food. Such a clean design. Easy to wash. Wow. If you've ever wanted to try out having an air fryer, I'd suggest you try this on first. Love a good product. Dislike rip off under-performers that cost me time and money returning them. ALSO -- COSORI actually provides contact info and encourages you to use it in case you are having any kind of problem with their unit. That's customer service!

  I read reviews and watched a few videos on different Air Fryers to see what the pros and cons where.  Decide on the Cosori 5.8 Qt for size, versatility and cost.  We tried it out for the first time to cook sweet potatoes and then turkey burgers without cleaning the fryer.  Following the cook book that came with it word for word, they came out amazing.  The burgers where full of juice when you cut into them.  It was way easier than ever to use and clean up was simple.  I can't believe how much cleaner the kitchen was compared to using a a cast iron skillet or traditional deep fryer.  We are excited to try so many different meals and options in the new Air Fryer.  We are a family of 5 and to make meals we may need to cook in it twice, however, it's that easy to prepare the foods and then cook them.  I would definitely recommend this Air Fryer to anyone think of getting one.

  What can I say...so far I love this air fryer. I have used it to make Crunchy Breaded Pork Chops and they were delicious and took half the time and were way healthier than frying in oil. In fact we haven't had anything fried in years but with this fryer it looks like my husband will be getting his old favorites back. Not only does it have the benefit of healthy dining but it takes less than half of the power it would take to use the conventional stove top or oven. I am pleasantly pleased and wish I had bought one sooner.

  I have had the Cosori Air Fryer XL for almost a year now.Pros: makes great food (chicken wings, fries, fish, potatoes, Brussel sprouts, steak, pork chops, kabobs). That's what I've made in there several times and love it. Easy to clean. Food comes out very flavorful, not dry, nor full of grease like with fried foods.Con: The outside began chipping a few months after using. The largest con however is the screw that keeps coming loose and has now completely fallen out from the handle, which is a huge safety hazard when handling this product hot. Wish there was a way I could get that part or even the whole basket replaced. The chipping and screws coming loose, I took 2 stars away!

  This is one of the best purchases I’ve made with Amazon! The Cosori air fryer 5.8 itself is truly wonderful!! I was afraid of bone in chicken breast drying out because I cooked them longer than suggested-they were large, but they were crispy and juicy!! My Son would not eat chicken breast from ANYWHERE bc he felt they were ALWAYS DRY, BUT he has changed his mind since using The COSORI AIR FRYER!! We’ve even roasted vegetables in it and they’re beautiful and tasty!! But it is the company’s CUSTOMER SERVICE that makes this purchase even better!! I had an issue with the basket coming apart from the base, I contacted the company prepared to argue the issue and was in complete surprise when no defense customer interaction took place!! They replied professionally and ALWAYS courteous!! They definitely understand that follow up is very important in customer satisfaction!!!!

  I was so in need of an air fryer! At first I thought this is to fancy for me, I mean why do I need it to have WiFi?!  So I got it earlier than Amazon said (bonus) I tried to set up the WiFi and it wouldn’t sync! After 15 minutes of trying I lost patience ( I just need it to cook) it cooked everything to perfection!The best thing about this Air fryer is it cooks enough fries for 6 ppl at a time at 5.8 qt’s! I also cooked 3 chicken breasts at a time!Downsides (outside of WiFi set up), it’s hard to operate when trying to open and separate the basket from the bottom. It’s also hard to put back together.  My teens (house full of boys) and husband will tear it up trying to use it because of the handling. The air fryer before this one was super simple.

  The fryer works great - once you get it started.  Like many others have stated, the touch pad is highly unresponsive and only certain buttons work - if you touch it just the right way.  Most of the time I just control it with the app, but not everyone in my household is tech savvy enough to download the app and control it this way.I do like the app. It is handy to be able to start it from another room, or monitor the cooking time that is left.As far as the taste and easy of cleaning, I think it does these things well.

  Love, love, love our air fryer. My spouse who is not a cook loves the fryer so much he has actually planned dinners, looked up recipes, and went grocery shopping for home cooked meals.  I came home from a long trip and was treated to a delicious steak dinner..The steak was juicy and tender and just delicious. It's user friendly and affective. Our food has never over cooked. Were recommend you check the food half way thru to check for doneness. It has a pause button so you can check the food.  Clean up is easy as well. We chose this air fryer because of the size and amount of food it can hold. There will be a little noise like air circulating but it's not overwhelming and doesn't bother us at all.  Happy with our air fryer and would recommend as an alternative to using the oven or frying pan

    Good Air Fryer with a few weak spots
  
",4.0,B Buhl,"Reviewed in the United States May 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  If you haven't tried Air Frying yet, you'll be pleasantly surprised by how versatile and easy to use these things are. This is a good sized fryer with some nice presets for commonly cooked items.Outside of a few things for baking, I've avoided the oven and cooked up some great meals with this fryer. From chicken breasts to crispy hash brown patties, you can cook up quite a variety and avoid unwanted grease.The unit is easy to clean.There is one big negative though - the buttons on the front are HORRIBLE. You power it up by pressing the power button repeatedly in the hopes that somehow your next push is the special one that makes it come on. Often you're doing it so rapidly at that point and switching fingers that you double clutch and turn it on and OFF again only to have to try again.Some of the presets work every single time, but other times you have to jam on them and I have yet to figure out how to get it to respond to manually setting the temp/time with the buttons.In comes the app, right?  Well, yeah, sort of.  It works fine if you want to use your phone and the app, however one huge flaw here is that you can only have 1 phone connected to it. So much for sparing everyone in the house the agony of using the sketchy buttons.  The minute someone else added the fryer it disconnected my device.Outside of those nuances, I think it is a great appliance and I've certainly gotten my use out of it. I wish they'd offer a way to improve on my button pushing game before my finger breaks off.

  My boyfriend got me this air fryer for my birthday last September (2020). I've always been curious about getting one, but also try to keep my kitchen appliances low due to space limitations. Welp, he ended up getting me the huge 5 quart one and I was a little taken aback, but definitely excited to use it and try it out.What can I say other than I've used this thing about 80% of the days since I got it- so easy to use and you can quickly make your fries, veggies, and even full meals (even a full rotisserie chicken!). One of my favorite things to make is egg cups (in silicone muffin holders) for breakfast. We also make wings often, which the recipe in the book for the sriracha wings comes out perfectly!Anyway, so I've had my amazing times with this air fryer and decided one day to let my boyfriend use it for making some chicken for burrito bowls. He pulled the basket out, and due to his inexperience of using it, he let it sit halfway in the air fryer instead of pulling it out fully and setting it on the counter. Well, my life flashed before my eyes as I saw the baskets drop to the floor. I was able to somewhat catch it, but it still hit the floor pretty hard. Now I'm not sure if it was due to it being hot that it warped so easily from this, but both of the inside and outside baskets warped a bit from the fall. Nothing major- it was still able to go back into the air fryer and no steam escaped- it was more of an aesthetic issue. It was then that i set off on my search for replacement baskets (while seriously reconsidering my relationship- I mean, it's like he broke a piece of my heart). Only the internal basket was sold separately on amazon. This led me to reach out to Cosori directly- and they actually offered to replace both baskets at no charge as a one time courtesy! I definitely wasn't expecting this since it was our fault the baskets warped and nothing to do with the product itself, but what amazing customer service!Now I can't guarantee they would replace another person's baskets due to damage done from their own error, but it was definitely impressive they offered to do it for me and I really appreciated it! You can definitely count on their customer service when purchasing this product, which is always important when getting a kitchen appliance.And now, my boyfriend is going to be monitored a bit more closely when he cooks with it...

  I decided to wait a little while before writing a review so I would have a chance to get use to using my airfryer and see if I like cooking in one. Well, I love my Cosori airfryer!  I am glad i got the larger size. I think anything smaller would have been too small for my husband and myself. I made the best thin cut bone in pork chops today! Crispy on the outside,  tender on the inside.  The only issue I have had is the small screws that hold the basket handle became loose and one screw fell out. Fortunately I found the screw and small nut. I put it back and tighten the others up. Something owners may want to check on their fryers. I still give it five stars.

  How did I ever live without an air fryer!? This appliance has literally replaced my oven ever since I bought it. I tend to relegate my appliances to a shelf or cabinet for the 1-2x a week I use them -- NOT THIS BAD BOY. He stays on the countertop because I literally use it every single day. Every day! You think a recipe can't be made in this? Think again. Anything that should go in your oven can now go in the air fryer for a fraction of the time and use way less energy. My oven takes forever to heat up, and you know it's big in there, so cooking time can take a long while! All of that goes away with an air fryer. You get that great texture on your food and reduced cooking time! This machine is also super easy to use, SUPER easy to clean and has all the easy buttons to make cooking whatever you're in the mood for simple. Cannot recommend this enough!

  I have never used an air fryer before.  I purchased this one and decided to make wings on Super Bowl Sunday.  I used the preset 'wing' function, which took 20 minutes (if I remember correctly).  Honestly, they came out exactly as if I had cooked them in the oven. . . not really impressed and not what I expected.  I thought they would be crispy as in 'deep fried crispy' or something at least similar.  They came out the same as in my oven - not what I wanted or expected.  I'll try some other items, or maybe not use the preset function and time them myself - I don't know.  But so far definitely disappointed.

  I was skeptical about using air fryers, but it turns out really great! I use less oil than cooking in a pan, and it gives food crispy texture. I tried to make crab cakes, wings and potato wedges. They all taste pretty darn close to restaurants. One thing I love about this air fryer is they do all the math for you, therefore, food is not over cooked. Juicy, tender and flavorful. They also include a booklet to inspire  you to pick. I never bake dessert before and I’m gonna try to make homemade brownies soon. I’m really glad that I pick the white color, very classy and elegant. I would put parchment paper in there before I fry next time because it takes me quite some time when you try to fry different food. Overall I’m satisfied with this purchase:)

  The air fryer is really what everyone says it is. COSORI is a great brand and the build quality is actually pretty great considering the price. The LED touch screen is super responsive and thankfully behind a layer of plastic covering (which is embedded so you can’t peel it) which means you don’t have to worry about the painted settings like other air fryers have. Biggest bonus, the basket is a square! This means you can fit more of the foods you love without stacking them.Unfortunately for me, after 5 months of use the basket/bucket wouldn’t click into place and kept shifting out. The good news, I called COSORI and explained the issue (3 min phone call) and they said they would send a replacement. Huuuuuge plus to be able to have a company that responds that quickly and painlessly. Customer service is A1 if you ever have any issues.

I have tried a variety of meals, and everything has come out great. Fish, chicken wings, eggs, garlic bread, steak, you name it.You do have to manage your expectations though. You're not going to get deep-fried flavour out of this, because the food doesn't sit in the oil. It does an ok job. but it's closer to baked than fried. Fries/potatoes come out somewhere in between baked/deepfried. There's also no tossing mechanism, so the food doesn't rotate on its own.I also continually underestimate how fast it cooks food. I have routinely started it, and then started working on sides, only for it to finish far faster than whatever else I'm doing. I'm honestly considering getting two of the things just so I can do two things at the same time.Utterly simple to clean.

  What do I like about it ?  The size and shape make it convenient for cooking; those round one reduce the space inside of the unit, this one has decent size for cooking.  The ease of use , the pictures for the presets make it easy to use and you have the option of increasing the temperature or time, if needed.  The food comes out great in a shorter period of time.  Although the unit is very easy to clean the only exception is trying to clean the fan unit.  You have to make sure you clean as much of the grease that can adhere to the top; there than that the clean up is great. I have a Foodi Grill that my children bought me but, I go to this unit first because it is much more lightweight and easier to clean.

  I was super excited to order this because there were so many great reviews a lot of purchases and we have a Cosori electric teapot at my office which works beautifully, has a great design and a great look. I thought this would be great too. I love the little black box that sits on my counter top, it's a nice looking appliance. The noise level is average compared to that of a microwave. It's easy to use except that the buttons do not always work. I sometimes have to turn the power off and start over because the up/down buttons do not register. The screws for the basket have to be tightened continually, otherwise, they fall out while youre cooking (shaking) the basket. I actually had to tighten the screws inside the tray (the part the basket sits in) when putting it back together this morning. Yes, the teflon coating is starting to peel off already. Its dishwasher safe but I'm not happy with the way it cleans up, it still looks dirty and maybe that's just how it is. One of the biggest issues was that we had to start propping the drawer (basket) shut with out Vitamix. It would continually pop open at random times while we were using it. Now that I have been tightening the screws on a regular, we have not been having that issue as much. In reading a lot of the reviews and looking at photos, I'm quite certain that our handle will probably break soon too. I know it has not been a year yet since our purchase, but I am already looking for a replacement. It makes good veggie tots though! My favorite thing to air fry next to beer battered fish.

I looked at quite a few air fryers in the process of trying to make up my mind.  It became clear to me that if I was going to get one, it needed to be a larger one to make it worth it.  I had never heard of Cosori before, but it was an Amazon’s Choice and had good reviews.  I liked the look of it and that it had a more squared basket than round.  It was a little more money than I had initially wanted to spend, but I went for it.  So glad I did!  I love this thing!

  Love not having to heat up the oven (energy cost savings!) to roast a few veggies or to heat up things that you really don't want to do in a microwave (pizza, bread, etc.) We use it nearly everyday. Easy to use; I'm constantly trying new things in it. Easy to search on Google for temp/time settings for nearly anything you want to fry, bake or roast. For heating up frozen fried foods, you don't need to add ANY oil at all. I DO recommend lining the basket with aluminum foil when possible for easy clean-up and immediate re-use without washing. NOTE: The 3 screws that hold the handle onto interior/exterior basket DO come loose so you'll need to use a small screwdriver to tighten them up. Discovered this when one fell out! Suggest you check these occasionally and tighten so you won't find a loose screw! (pun intended ;)

  I paid $75 for it during Black Friday deals so I think it’s a 4.5 stars. If I were to pay the original price I’d probably give it 4 stars instead. Very easy to use and I like the smart phone app option. BUT, the plastic smell when used really bothers me. Every time I turn on the fryer a strong plastic smell comes out and it sometimes smokes my eyes. It’s getting a lot better, but it’s taken more than 10 uses to get here. I checked lots of reviews and QAs here. The seller suggested running the fryer at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, or soak the plastic in vinegar for 30 minutes. My friend who has the same model told me she ran the machine outside a few times before she took it in. I tried all the above and overall it took me more than 10 times to finally feel the smell is acceptable... I think it’s slowly going away, but just be ware...

  Everything works like a charm, food tastes great, large basket for just about anything, presets make it super easy, price is unbeatable and the best part the clean up, so easy. This is the one to get in my opinion. I know there’s a lot of them to choose...I know I was determined to get one from Emeril L. but when I saw this; the price, the features well...keep shopping and keep looking but I tell you the basket is a lot bigger then most brands.

  Are you kidding, I cannot believe there is an Air Fryer such as the Cosori 5.8 quart, I have only used it to fry Tilapia Fish with fries so far and believe me, I will be using this fryer for 90% of my cooking. The outside dimensions are great and especially the inner bucket to hold the food. Very nice styling, it looks great on the countertop. It is very solid, very well made. The touch screen features are excellant to fry foods, the cookbook that is included is tremendous.

  This is a large piece of kitchen appliance. It was much larger than I thought it would be. It takes up a large space on the counter.It works extremely well. The rectangular basket holds a surprisingly large amount of anything. It cooks things just as well as baking in the oven, but just a few minutes quicker, and also using less energy.I'm still trying new recipes, but so far everything I have tried to cook in it has come out absolutely delicious and, most importantly, free of the cooking oils I'd need for pan frying.The only real downside it the pans are so large I can only fit the pans in the dishwasher with nothing else. A small price to pay for good food.

  I burned the first 5 or 6 things we cooked in here because it just cooks way faster than the instructions say. I've found the cooking temp to be about 50 degrees less than the oven and cooking time to be 1/3 to 1/2 of oven. Just keep in mind you can always put something back in to cook longer but you can't come back from overcooked or burnt. Now that we've adjusted we are loving how fast it cooks and that everything comes out juicer and more flavorful than deep frying, with the danger, mess, health concerns, and without heating the house up using the oven. Highly recommend air fryers in general and I think we made a good choice in picking this one.

  My daughter had been very positive about using an air fryer even though she had a smaller one than this model. I decided if it was going to work out well for me that I wanted a larger one to handle more meal options. I decided on this model from Cosori CP-158F 5.8 qt model.I could not be happier with my purchase as I'm using the fryer almost every day for either main courses or sides. I have yet to cook something in it that wasn't as good or better in the fryer than previous methods.....usually better. Having a crisp outer surface with a juicy interior makes so many foods better.Have done everything from fry frozen food such as french fries and egg rolls to grilled cheese sandwiches to hot dogs to fried rice to filet mignon. The cookbook that comes with the unit has a number of recipes that are now in our routine for meals such as chicken parmesan. Google is your friend for finding air fryer recipes.I thought fryer would mainly substitute for the microwave and provide better ""heated-up food"". It does that and so much more. Would have never thought I'd be doing so many main courses in the fryer. And the fact that it cooks faster than a traditional oven is also a plus.I did bump into problem with bolts loosening in the handle that others have experienced. I would encourage you to check their tightness on occasion. Had tightened them once when loose. But the upper bolt in handle came out and the bolt for it is located inside handle and could not get it in position to repair. I contacted customer service  and provided the requested information. A new inner basket/handle was delivered FedEx at no charge just 7 days after reporting the problem. Communication from customer service was outstanding from initial reporting to providing a tracking number for the replacement part.I cannot compare  the fryer to other models or brands as this is the only one I've used. But am very impressed with this Cosori model and their customer service.

  To be frank, I thought this was one of those gadgets that they sell on TV and it disappears after a while since it doesn't really do anything or solve any problem as they claim.But to my surprise, this has been one of the best investments that I made in my kitchen. I bought this on a daily deal and used it after a couple of weeks of buying it being still sceptic of it's abilities.When I used it first time, it blew my mind. Not fried, but fried? It was like "" I can't believe it's not butter"".Make sure that you buy the biggest version though since 5.8 was barely enough to put a whole chicken in it, so buying a smaller version is not a good idea.

  What I love:Food comes out great! Didn’t think I’d like from scratch fries in here but they really do get crispy with very little oil! Love it for that! I use it mostly to get my kids quick meals like chicken nuggets and fries or taquitos, Texas toast, frozen pizza, crisp up asparagus. It’s a great size to get enough food for 2-3 people. Def not a full meal but a side. Tried roasting a chicken but wasn’t as moist as I like it to be, perfect an oven for roasting chicken. But I absolutely love the kabob skewer it came with! My daughter loves the kabobs and made me make it for her for about 5 days straight!The bad side?The basket is super tricky to clean! Time consuming! Also the tray the basket sits in has a screw that CONSTANTLY gets looks and causes the basket to sit funny and allow to much steam escape when getting g hot. Now the screw seems to be over screwed if that makes sense and is loose.All in all! I love it and I am an air fryer lover now! Maybe down the road when I need a new one I’ll probably try another brand but I bought this because it was inexpensive and it came with an additional gadget. But it really is great!

Lastly, it makes cooking SOO much easier and faster. So far I have only cooked regular potatoes and sweet potatoes but I can't believe how easy it is.

  Have used this 2 days in a row and made 3 different dishes. Disappointed to report that this machine is not made to be used immediately and NOTHING in the instruction manual advises to “condition” the machine before use. After reading ALL of the negative reviews I realized this machine should be turned on (as if being used but with no food inside) for about 5 hours  for the disgusting manufacturing plastic smell to go away. The first meal I made was bacon wrapped chicken and roasted potatoes and the smell was horrendous but the food tasted fine. The next day when reheating the food for lunch all of it tasted strong of plastic. I used the machine the next day to male pork chops again the smell too strong to bare (it even over powers the aroma of food you’re making)and this time the pork chops tasted like the plastic ass soon as it was ready. I’m “conditioning” the machine now. I’ve turned it on to 400 and letting it stay on at 15 minute intervals to see if this helps

  This is a great unit.  I've bought and returned an air fryer before and I've borrowed my mother-in-laws.  Both units were a pain in the arse to clean even though they made great food.  I decided to get this unit because it was lower price around Prime Day thinking I'd probably have to return this too if cleanup was too much.  We've used this air fryer at least 25 times or more since having it over last few weeks.  Each time the food has been great and the cleanup has been simple.This is worth the cost.The cookbook has been quite helpful as well for both ideas on what to cook in it and as a guide for cooking times on stuff you normally cook in a big oven.  No longer do we need to heat up the big oven to cook a few chicken tenders or heat up some other small item.  You do have to be careful and write down times (for future cooking) as this device has cooked these items much faster than my big convection oven.

  This is a pretty new addition to our kitchen, and it's going to take a little bit of time to get used to cooking with it (as with all new things). The few things we have tried have turned out great, but I did overcook the steaks.There are two reasons it doesn't get 5 stars.1. It's noisy. The fan which circulates the air inside the cooking basket is definitively noisy.2. The touch panel at the front seems like cheap plastic. Response to touch isn't great, and it gives if you push a little hard.

Often times I find myself pressing the buttons multiple times to get it to sense that I'm touching it. It can get annoying over time.2) The handle comes loose over time and needs to be tightened.

  We ordered the COSORI Smart WiFi Airfryer for my dad for Christmas and we have been nothing but impressed so far! It takes a little trial and error to determine how long foods should cook to be at your preferred crispness, but once that’s figured out—perfect every time! We have made both frozen foods (French fries, tator tots, etc.) and fresh foods (breaded chicken cutlets), both exceeding our expectations for crispy outside and warm, well-done insides. We have found that some foods are just better with a little olive oil sprayed on, but it still feels so much more healthy eating these foods without putting them in the deep fryer!The shake reminder is an excellent feature of this device, as you can walk about and do something else and hear when you must move the food around. My dad really enjoys being able to preheat/adjust the airfrying using the Amazon Alexa.Overall, happily surprised with the quality of this product and it ended up being the best Christmas present of the year!

After a few uses, the touch screen buttons became unresponsive, requiring me to press the desired function up to 8 times before it would register. Next, a screw fell out of the fryer basket, there was no way to rescrew it in manually. The other 2 screws needed to be tightened using a phillps head screwdriver after every use. Now the prongs that hold the basket closed no longer engage to keep the basket securely in place. When the fryer works (with way too much tinkering) the food is great.

  This is my third air fryer.  All three have had their pro's and con's.  This one seems to cook very well.  The basket is shallow with maybe a little larger surface area than the others.  There is no need for a deep basket with these air fryers.  There is one problem with this model IMO.  The start/pause button is right next to the power on/off button.  On several occasions I have pushed the basket in - set the temp, set the time and then pushed power on/off by accident.  So this ends up being something like 10 button pushed all for not.  This is extremely frustrating.  The power on/off button should be located on the upper left or right of the panel, not right in the middle.  Poor design.  Otherwise the unit works very well.

Easy to use, big basket, and gets the job done!

When my girlfriend cooked last, and I try to use it with my phone, it will automatically hook up to the last person to use it. So you have to reset the WiFi by holding the WiFi button for a few seconds and reconnect with a new person. Annoying!

  Best small appliance EVER...I have owned mine for 6 months now and can honestly say It is worth every penny and more. I USE MINE ALMOST EVERY DAY, I cook for 1 or 2, so I am able to cook both proteins and veggies at the same time. Very easy clean up and so versatile, as you can Fry, Bake, Grill, Roast and as a Notorious Grill Cheese Burner, I can swear to you, that you wont ever burn a sandwich again😉 It really is a great healthy option for cooking...I have been Keto for 4 years and missed ""crunch"" in foods...but not anymore! Thank you Corsori...for this Game Changer ...I can't wait to receive the new Toaster Oven type one that I am getting for my BFs house too😁 PS. CORSORI has thee best customer service ever, IF you need them AND an amazingly Fun FB Group to help you along the way😊

    Harmful Plastic Chemical Smell!!!
  
",1.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  I wanted to love my Cosori air fryer so bad. I purchased the white one, which looked very nice and was the perfect size to cook food for a family of 4. I liked the recipe book, and the settings made cooking super easy. I was so disappointed however that there was a terrible plastic smell. The odor was so overwhelming that we had to open windows to get the smell out of our house.! I returned it and purchased the stainless steel Bagotte air fryer. The switch was worth the inconvenience - I'm so much happier with my new purchase!

  I wasn't really sure that spending the money on an air fryer would be worth it. After reading reviews, talking to people who have (and love) air fryers, I decided to give it a try. This fryer was one of the best I could find and the price couldn't be beat on prime day. I am SO happy with this purchase! EVERYTHING we have made in this fryer has come out even better than we ever thought it would. Even baked potatoes are amazing!Cleaning couldn't be easier - pop out the cooking basket and both the basket and the bottom of the fryer are easily wiped clean.It seemed overwhelming trying to figure out what could be made in an air fryer, but I'm slowly coming to realize that EVERYTHING can go in there! This fryer has buttons for some things (like bacon) making it even easier to use.I can't say enough good things about this and highly recommend adding this to your kitchen!

  I did a lot of research before buying and it came own to this and one other. I'm satisfied with my decision and glad I finally got an air fryer! Having fun with it.  I read some reviews that condensation puddles along the bottom and I see that to be true, but it so minimal, who cares? Why complain about that. I've also seen comments that it smokes sometimes, this is true. It depends how much oil is in the air fryer, the more oil, the more smoke.  I'm still learning how to use it. So far, it's easy to use, I like the square basket, it's super easy to clean. No complaints other than for this price, they should have included some extras. I've seen other Cosori models with the dehydrating racks or skewers.  It should have come with some ""toys"" instead of trying to charge us $30 more for those things.  Because at the end of the day, this product is probably not so dissimilar to a $80 air fryer, except that it has the square basket and it's overall footprint is small for it's capacity.  The cookbook is handy only from the standpoint of giving you an idea of time/temperature for things.  But those are easily googleable.

  I purchased Cosori AF on 2/9/2020 thru Amazon. The reviews were outstanding, i didn't consider any other brands. I haven't used it a lot but i had a couple of issues with the performance of the unit. I joined a Face Book Group for Cosori Air Fryer recently which is super helpful with recipes and using the AF. With my AF having some issues and almost a year after purchase i thought i was just going to throw out the AF. I contacted support@cosori.com, one day ago. Sent some pictures, receipt etc and told them my issues with the AF. They were outstanding, quick to respond, they are replacing my Air Fryer immediately, all within 24 hours of contacting them.  I am so impressed with Cosori Customer Service. They truly stand behind their product. I would highly recommend doing business with Cosori and join the FB Cosori Air Fryer Group and you will be making wonderful meals. I see why Cosori is a top rated Air Fryer with Amazon.

  My first air fryer and definitely not disappointed. This thing works great. I love having crispy fries, fish sticks, chicken nuggets, chimichangas, etc. I've made a few the recipes in the book it came with and yum! Great for cooking salmon, pork chops, and of course fried chicken. I've adjusted a few of the recipes as the cooking time needed a little adjusting for the thickness but that was expected. Try Parmesan garlic asparagus in this. Just need some oil, garlic salt, Parmesan and of course asparagus. About 7 minutes later (depending on thickness) at 400 degrees....yum!Make sure you get the right spray oil for this. It can cause a sticky residue build up.

  I've had mine for a week now and really like it. I read reviews mentioning a plastic smell and taste. So I unboxed it, wash the baskets in warm soapy water, dried them, put them in the unit, and did 3 preheat cycles at 350, 380, and 400 degrees. Removed baskets each time and let it cool before doing another cycle. Yep, smelled like plastic. Then I did a test run with frozen crinkle cut fries. They cooked up good, crispy, tender on the inside...but smelled like plastic. Tossed them out. Undeterred, I cooked another batch, this time with meat rub seasoning. Still a little plastic aroma but not as bad. Wiped it out, did a couple more 400 degree preheats, let it cool and then did a batch of frozen hatch chili chicken wings. That did the trick, no more plastic smell, tasted great. I've made different things since then and the plastic smell is gone. So before you make something you put a lot into, run some preheat cycles and cheap frozen foods through it to season it. Works great now!

  I like the wifi option and the ability to use an app. Setting it up is not the easiest. Maybe I had a slight dud out the box but the front panel isn't user friendly. To scroll through the functions or even push the buttons seem to be difficult. I've hade it since February and just now writing this review. Don't get me wrong once you get it working, its a great air fryer but the controls are difficult. And at this price point which is not overly expensive, I need it to be user friendly. I just finally got tired of fighting with the controls and donated this air fryer to goodwill and got a Ninja which so far works better for the same price.

   First air fryer ever so I dont have much of a reference aside from a regular stove. But I do love the tine it saves me and the way it cooks my party wings. The only downside is, some buttons on the key pad are not selectable. So when you have to preheat, good luck with that.... And mine won't select the bread setting. Sometimes if you stand there long enough (about 4 minutes just pressing) it will eventually press. So ive tried to memorize the amount of pressure anf locstion of where I pressed but its never consistent. So i just press any button to preheat. Other than that, I do enjoy the item.

  Not only do the screw pop off of the unit into your food while cooking, the drawer does not stay shut and pops open during the cook time!

I would not recommend that you buy this product unless you’re willing to inspect your food prior to putting it in your mouth every time you use it.

  I'm still learning how to use it, but I am overall happy with my purchase.It cooks HOT. I have found the recipe book settings to be too much. I have burned a few things. My advice - check your food several times after the half-way time. Whether or not the meat is room temperature may make a big difference in cooking times.I like the oven fry potatoes a lot. The thinner you slice them, the crispier they get. I have cooked 2 large russet potatoes in there, but it might hold up to 4. For smaller food items likes fries, it is imperative that you toss them at the midpoint, otherwise they have zebra stripes at the end.I also like chicken thighs, super easy. I like to marinate them in olive oil and teriyaki sauce, but the great thing is, you can use any marinade- barbecue sauce, chipotle sauce, tikka masala sauce, anything. My wife likes harissa sauce. The basket holds 4. I have found that 20 minutes is too long. Crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside.Negatives - the unit is noisier than I anticipated, about the sound of your stove top hood running on medium. The non stick coating seems thin, I have already scratched it. Rubber tipped tongs are recommended. The basket is not easy to get totally clean.A 5 minute warm-up is recommended, but I'm going to experiment with shortening that. Most cooking times are going to be 15-20 minutes, so it's 20-25 minutes per batch.

  What a great addition to my kitchen! It’s big, but make some space and get to using it. I mainly use it to reheat leftovers, cook frozen foods, and make toast. It’s not so great on the toast front, but frozen chicken nuggets come out crispy and great. I do find the controls a bit frustrating. When you plug it in, you have to touch the Power On button. Then, after you choose a setting, you have to touch another button to start it. It’s a minor thing, but annoying. It’s easy to clean and the basket is big enough for all I’ll ever need for one person. I tried it with a rack, but that didn’t work as well. I’m not sure if I should have changed the settings with more food in there at one time. I should read the Manual. LOL. All in all, I’m happy with this appliance.

  Personally it has worked flawlessly. Some have commented bout the keypad being a problem but I've found that you need to use quick taps and not longer presses to get it to adjust settings. Out of the box did onion rings, egg rolls and twice baked potatoes without a hitch. I can see a light bit of oil spray (PAM) will improve these even further. A little practice will go a long way to making you a good cook with one of these, they are not magic boxes but a tool to save you all the hassles of deep frying things. The included cookbook is a nice starting point and has useful recipes to get you going. I did buy additional accessories because the pans & racks etc. I had on hand were jut a bit too large to fit. I would recommend at least getting some parchment liners to make cleaning as easy as possible. I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere yet, but I'm betting this is going to be the best hot nacho maker ever invented.

  This is a sleek air fryer with excellent pre programming. It is very easy to use. I like to line the pan with parchment paper on the bottom to avoid moisture loss and for extra cleanliness (but do not have excess paper over the top, as it will singe with the heating element).It is durable and very easy to clean. The pans do fit in the bottom tray of the dish washer if you need to deep clean them. The unit does get warm but not alarmingly hot when in use. The beep function to remind you to shake the food is useful. Makes tofu, fries, carrots, chicken, to perfection. Used every week for a quick meal with painless cleanup. And no greasy splatter yay!

  This is one of the best purchases I've ever made!! We've made SO many batches of wings in this thing! Even made entire meals. It makes way better wings than my oven has ever made, and way faster! Chicken, potatoes, vegetables, fries, pizza rolls, grilled cheese sandwiches... it cooks everything!! Anything you might WANT to fry will taste 1000% better from this thing. Fits LOTS of food- perfect for bigger families! Fast, fast cook times. I can't say enough- we love this Air Fryer!!

    GREAT EASY MEALS

  I have had my COSORI for 3 months and my meals have become so easy and delicious. I had just moved in and my countertop appliances were not expected for weeks. I purchased the COSORI and it is the ONLY countertop appliance I have. All the others went into storage and will eventually get donated. For breakfast I make omelets, toast, cheese toast, toasted bagels and a delicious breakfast sandwich on an everything bagel. In a cravet I use alittle olive oil, egg and sausage patty. Roast at 350 for 10 min, the bagel is sliced and goes in the basket with the egg blend for another 3-4 minutes. Enjoy. I marinate my meats in single portion ziplock. I prepare a veggie medley of olive oil, Dales Seasoning, Dry Rub or Seasoning to choice, Salt and Pepper in a large bowl with zucchini, summer squash, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, vidalia onion, chopped fresh asparagus, and sweet peppers. I then choose between tater tots, sweet potato fries or french fries. I will add the meat, spoon my veggie medley in and my choice of fries. The cooking temperature of 350 at 18 minutes usually prepares my meals to delicious perfection. My favorite is salmon as the salmon is the best I have ever had. I have found I will not need to go out to eat after the virus quarintene is over as most restaurant food will come in a distant second. I am still experimenting with different meals and honestly have not even opened the cookbook which came with the fryer. My alexa is somewhere in storage and have not found it yet, but the display is so simple, I don't think alexa can make it any easier, I maybe wrong, but at this time I don't need it. The Cosori is easy to clean, takes only a minute and ready to back into use. Again, ENJOY, this is a great product.

  I had been shopping for an air fryer for about a year and when this showed up in my search on Prime Day, I decided to take a chance. There are sooo air fryers to choose from so I feel lucky that I LOVE this purchase. It’s been super hot in SoCal, I’ve used the air fryer almost every single day to make fries, hot dogs, homemade meatballs and salmon patties, frozen dumplings, toasted bread, reheated leftovers, etc. I appreciate how quickly the preheat happens, the hot air circulated nicely to cook food evenly and quickly.  I move the air fryer to the backyard when I cook so it doesn’t heat up my house and I keep the cooking smells outside. The one trick I would suggest for any airfryer is to be sure to shake the basket every 5-7 minutes. Shaking makes a world of difference. The basket holds more than enough food for the 2 of us. I will be taking this to the next level soon - like baking muffins and cake. Can’t wait!

  This arrived with some sort of oily film on the front screen.  it is impossible to remove. (yes, I removed the plastic label cover with the writing on it).  Looks like somebody with greasy fingers wiped their hands on it.  Can't remove it no matter what.  Looked like someone had previously tried because the plastic had a lot of light scratches.  Just didn't look clean.  I don't know if it is the type of plastic used or what, but just didn't look clean to me.  Once I pressed a few buttons, my fingerprints were quite obvious.  I have better things to do than wipe a screen constantly, especially when it still looks greasy after I do.  Also, I didn't like the flimsiness of the shield/button on the basket.  I know there are a lot of good reviews out there, maybe I just got a reject?

    You will never want to cook with anything else.
  
",5.0,Irene P Hommert,"Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2019","I use it several times a week. It is simple to use and to clean. I’ve had it Three months.
So far these are the things I have tried in it.
Bacon
Chicken wings
Chicken drummies
Chicken thighs
Chicken legs
Chicken breasts
Pork tenderloins
Pork chops
Swordfish
Hamburgers
Hard boiled eggs ( not really boiled but cooked in the Shell until hard)
Sausage links
Sausage patties
Asparagus
Cauliflower
Carrots
Onions
French fries
Cornish Hens
Toasted Cheese Sandwiches

I like everything I’ve cooked in it. Some more than others. For instance, carrots, I liked them but I really prefer the taste of them cooked another way. The roasted cauliflower was one of my favs.

I gotta tell you, as much as we like wings, that would make it worth the purchase alone.

We were down at our cabin with friends. I had taken the air fryer down there with us. One day I made wings, flats and drummies, no sauce. They ate and ate and ate. Went home and ordered their own fryer.

Bacon is another thing. It’s amazing. You pour out the grease and wash the pan and boom, you are done. No mess!!

It’s really just a small convection oven. I don’t know why but I could never achieve the same results in the large one I have in my kitchen.

I’m a big fan of mine so much so that I would like to buy another one so I could cook two dishes at the same time. Hubby would have a fit though.

All this being said, the food does not cook itself. You do have to prepare it and by that I mean oil and seasoning. You also have to experiment with cook times. And you have to check on the food when it’s cooking so that you don’t over cook it.

I use a Facebook page that was set up by Cosori for tips and questions. The people on there are always very helpful. Also whenever I want to cook something, I just google “air fryer________. “, that usually brings up some nice recipes.

I bought Cosori because I didn’t want to pay 300 dollars for the Phillips, which is top rated. The GoWise was second rated but it has horrible reviews on Amazon. I opted for the Cosori which got good reviews and a fair price.", 5.8 QT

  I purchased this air fryer after the one I had fell apart.  I used it but not everyday.  The teflon inside had come off and the clips holding the basket fell out.  I am happy to say that I received a refund since it was less than a year.  With so many now on the market this one caught my eye.  Its color and finish is perfect.  I chose the red.  The inside is larger than whati had so it fits more. And the size is perfect.  This is kind of square which fits on my counter much better than the round one.  Made a few dinners and everything came out perfect.  Clean up was better than my last.  Anything left inside slid right out.  I am very happy with my purchase and will look forward to making some of the recipes that came with air fryer.

  Update: I Have to raise this to 5 stars for the simple fact that this company actually reads the reviews and WILL respond.

I did not request a new unit as I waited beyond the time to return do to work travel. They reached out and proceeded to take care of my situation. I would highly recommend this company!!!Prior review:  Not simple to use. The main touch screen control panel will not allow you to adjust the time or temp, it seems to be only for preset cooking. Not all the screen options are usable. If you want to adjust the time and temp you must down load an app and connect to the fryer through wi-fi to you properly control this unit.

  We live in a hot climate (all year). This eliminates heating up the house by using the oven which is a HUGE plus for us. The buttons are great for people who don’t really cook. Just preheat (using the preheat button) and choose what you’re cooking. There’s a chicken button, a pork button, a root vegetable button and so on. This was also a great function for someone like myself. It’s THAT easy. The nonstick is just that. Avoid using sprays like Pam, as that’s what will take the coating off as you may see in other reviews. Just dab olive oil or get a “spray/mister” that you can put your olive oil into. We don’t have a lot of counter space so we store it in a cabinet and because it’s lightweight...another plus for this gal! The cleaning is as simple as cleaning a nonstick cookie sheet. Done. Make sure to follow their Facebook page for recipes or help. We’ve cooked steak, chicken, pork, cauliflower and brussel sprouts so far and have yet to be disappointed.

  I don't normally come back to post reviews. And in this case, I waited a little while so I didn't get carried away by great first impressions. Well, after owning the Cosori for a while, I can safely say this air fryer is................great. It's just great.When you see a product with sooooooooooooooo many great reviews from verified buyers, you feel a large amount of trust in your purchase. Still, anything can happen, right? This air fryer is everything I thought it would be and more. Perfect in execution, large basket size, easy to clean, and it looks great on one of my kitchen counters.To anyone concerned about noise, take a moment to understand how these devices work. There's a fan inside that circulates the heat coming off a heating element. There's a small exhaust area on the back of this air fryer that pushes out some warm air. This fan does *not* put out noise that should bother you at all. I think you'd have to be super-sensitive to the smallest noises to even care. I've had the air fryer running about 5 feet away from me while I'm watching TV and I don't even notice it. Again...look at all the verified ""great"" reviews and make up your own mind.I couldn't be happier with this purchase, and I look forward to medium-to-heavy use of this Cosori air fryer in the future.

  I had an incredibly disturbing experience tonight- My boyfriend literally ended up with a screw in his mouth.

This is incredibly dangerous, he could have choked or broken a tooth. Don't want to think about what would have happened if this had happened to a small child. I've only had the air fryer for a month and use it just once or twice a week (so light use). See attached pictures.

  I had an actifry from tfal for many years and was really happy with it for some applications but was irritated that the stirring mechanism kept me from air frying larger items or fragile items. My actifry finally broke and I went in search of a replacement. I googled best air fryers and this was number one on the list.I can't believe how easy it is to cook with this appliance. The buttons are all very user friendly. The basket is coated in non stick and has generous air holes but they aren't large enough that food falls through. It has been a breeze to clean. I've had it for a week and we've made fried chicken, schnitzel, Brussels sprouts, tater tots, fries, mozzarella sticks, pot stickers and jalapeno poppers in it. Everything turned out great and nothing was hard to clean up, not even the fried chicken. The bottom basket/tray is also coated in non stick. I soaked it in warm water for 5 minutes and it wiped clean.I have a family of 5 and we had to split the fried chicken into 2 batches. It comfortably fit 4 thighs in one batch and a breast and 4 legs in the next. I just kept the first batch on a plate covered to keep warm and then popped them back in for a minute after the 2nd batch to heat them up.

  After looking into any issues with the air fryer purchased,  error code, E1, started coming on whenever we started the fryer. Worked around it by manually setting time and temp. Looked into trouble shooting and read if this error code repeatedly shows to return the product. I called the customer support and only got a person on the phone wanting to sell me a $100 credit for using my credit card to purchase the card for $1.99. Return says I had till November 16th to return, which would have been fine if the error code showed within that period of time. Not sure of my options at this time and look forward to someone contacting me about this issue.To further the issue, it is now February 16th and we have had to put the air fryer away when it started smoking when we were attempting to cook some fries. Everytime we have used it since our first review we have had to reset the temp and the time, sometimes that worked, sometimes it didn't. This was the last  straw when it started smoking and looked like it was an electrical risk. As stated before, reached out to manufacturer and have not been able to contact.

  So I had owned a competing brand and it honestly never worked properly. The touch pad buttons never really worked the down key went out completely in the first 6 months so it was impossible to move time or temp down. It did do it's job and the cooking was so easy I could not bare the thought of losing it for even one day, so I made work arounds that did the trick for all the Gourmia's many shortfalls. When the Corsori arrived I was hopeful but not overly so because I had tried The Ninja Foodi first and was also disappointed in it's shortcomings (tried to do too much and did nothing well). So I took out the basket Ah ha! Square! Not circular or Semi squarish with a kind of tapering basket but actually square! The basket also seemed noticeably larger even though it was only half a quart bigger. The button functionality is awesome many, many presets and it easy to adjust to whatever time or temp you need. the one con I would say is that you have to empty the fryer basket every time you use it. There is no space because of the size of the basket. Other than that awesome machine!

",5.0,Debbie Kleppek,"Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2021","









  
  
    
  I had looked for awhile for an air fryer, final found this one.  I wanted a tray that would hold more food, this is square with rounded edges so you can fit chicken legs, fish, etc because of the size.  Other fryers are round and have lower quality, but not Cosori.  GREAT QUALITY!  I love the extended warranty, recipe book and you can see recipes on their Facebook profile.  This is awesome and have recommended it to friends.  Love it, though it was a gift to myself and my husband uses it all the time. 10 stars if they rated it to 10.

  This fryer does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Meats are cooked to perfection and they are not dried out.  This appliance saves me so much time.  I can season and throw wings in the fryer and they're done in 20 minutes.  I also have air fried steak, lamb and chicken breasts in the fryer.  I love this machine.  My husband, who is very picky about his meals, loves the way the meat tastes.  I strongly recommend.

  I’ve been hearing about these Air Fryers but didn’t purchase because I recently purchased a 8qt multi cooker. I wanted something versatile but easy to use. I must say I’ve used this Air Fryer 3 times and have not used my multi cooker at all. What sets the Corosi apart is how easy it is to use. The one push cook buttons make everything so easy. The first time I used it, I made potato wedges (had a nice crisp to them). I should’ve taken a picture. Next, I cooked 2 NY strip steaks. Listen, those steaks were so tender (cooked to perfection). I would like more of a sear on them next time so I may try something different. Finally, the chicken wings....BABY never in my life have I had chicken wings so light but crispy AND flavorful without the grease. I’m never cooking friend chicken in a pan again. I’m going to try salmon, sweet potato fries, pizza and veggies next. I love the shake function and it’s easy to clean. The recipe book is nice but I haven’t used it yet.Definitely worth the money and there is no need to buy a more expensive one. I can’t imagine another item in my kitchen that’s worth $99. I am seriously considering returning my multi cooker because of this savior. Buy it. You won’t regret it.

  The size of this air fryer is great. You can fit 12 wings in here, chicken— bigger items—without doing several different cooks. Performs great. I like the separate basket and bottom which makes cleaning and juggling it easier. It is bulky because of its size, but the material is a little cheap.I’ve had this for several months and still good. My only complaints are it’s a little cheap material and the digital screen can be finicky, the drawer has smoke that comes out so it’s not completely shut, and the smell of it isn’t amazing. But it cooks fantastically.

  We've owned, but rarely used, a much smaller air fryer of a different brand.  After deciding to increase our air frying and reduce grease/fat frying we purchased this Cosori 5.8.  It's wonderful.  Lots of room in the squarish basket.  The times and temps in the recipe book are spot on.  We've cooked chicken, meats, and lots of vegetables with amazing success.  Meats and chicken came out with a crunch to the outside but nice and juicy and tender inside.  AND - this is an important point - with the air fryer there are no meat spatters on the stove top so less cleaning!  The basket washes up easily, even after doing pork chops and chicken thighs.  We are totally enjoying our new, more spacious fryer and have great plans for future meals.

  I was doubtful about an air fryer, but this one won me over. With the presets, it is SO simple to use. It holds a lot. I often put about two pounds of veggies in it. We use it several times a week from fish to veggies. I bought an oil sprayer and keep melted coconut oil in it to spray on the food. Then I add my favorite seasonings, preheat, add food,  press preset, and turn on. At first, I forgot to turn it on after choosing the pre-set, but I soon got in the habit.I highly recommend this air fryer.

  I think air fryer is a misnomer. This is really a compact convection oven. It has a heater and a fan. It is an intense convection oven. It produces a wide variety of foods with unique characteristics, in addition to mimicking oil frying pretty well. I find it works especially well for breaded chicken and catfish, frozen french fries, frozen breaded shrimp and fish, sauteed vegetables like mushrooms and zucchini, and drummies. I am using my Cosori almost every day and it is adding a new creative element to my cooking. I am using my regular oven quite a bit less.

I like that it's more square inside. Also, it is truly non stick. VERY easy to clean. It doesn't seem to have a coating on the basket or inside like my old one. So there is no peeling. I like that it has the preheat function which it says is crucial for proper frying. I get good results, but the best thing is how easy it is to clean.

  We have been using our air fryer now for about 5 months pretty regularly.  Roasted veggies, chicken wings, fries, and all sorts of stuff.  We love it.Cosori is also a great brand that stands behind their product.  Our basket had the 3 screws that hold the handle start loosening.  They have lock washers, but my guess is the frequent heat-cycling between cooking and then cleaning allowed it to loosen up.  Easy enough to tighten up.  But I emailed support, and they sent us a new basket free of charge.  We can now alternate and the screws don’t seem to back off now.  Very happy with the product, and happier with the support.

  Basket size is square and large enough to prepare food for 3 people (or more).  Very easy to clean, even in the dishwasher.  We were somewhat doubtful that this type of appliance was something we needed, but after a day or two it became a regular in our kitchen. Chicken wings, vegetables, pork roasts etc. cook much more quickly than in the oven and it doesn't heat up the kitchen.  Comes with easy directions and a nice selection of recipes.  Strongly recommended!UPDATED REVIEW: We continue to use this appliance more and more over time. It has continued to amaze me with the range of cooking it can do. Whole chickens, sausage patties, hamburgers, whole sweet potatoes and more come out perfectly.  Pork chops in this air fryer are the best we have ever eaten...even better than using the souse vide method.  Much quicker and easier as well!Although we have used this air fryer multiple times a week for almost a year, it has absolutely no signs of wear. Other products I have read reviews on often speak about the finish flaking off and other defects....but not so with this product. Truly a great product that I continue to recommend in the strongest terms !!!

  UPDATE: Since we purchased this, we use it fairly regularly.  It gets used, washed, and set out to dry. Lately, we have not been as diligent with cleaning and I've noticed a few things. The screws need to be tightened regularly. More importantly, the sides take a little longer to clean.  Today, I decided to put it in the dishwasher for the first time because it says ""The nonstick basket is removable and dishwasher safe, made with PFOA-free and BPA-free basket materials.""  This is grossly misstated. I took it out of the dishwasher and it looks terrible. Much of the coating has come off and there are spots all over it. Btw, the dishwasher is about a year and a half old. Such a disappointment that  I now have to get a replacement basket. Those 5.8 quart baskets are not easy to come by! Anyway, buyer beware.I absolutely love this thing! I am just starting to use the app more frequently for different recipes. Food comes out as expected. I bought an oil sprayer from Amazon as well. Helps to really keep fries crispy rather than using a tablespoon of oil like some recipes call for. Been trying to convince my wife we need another because lets face it, if you make burgers in it, the fries would not be immediately ready when the burgers finish. Same with veggies etc.

I highly recommend it. Just make sure to sign up for the extended warranty!!I purchased this air fryer back in December 2019. After 1 year and 2ish months it malfunctioned. It began to smoke up and release a burning order. I used it at least 3-4 times a week. I contacted cosori via email, and got a response within minutes. Their customer service was excellent! A new replacement unit was sent to me, and i’m back to using the air fryer.

  Not impressed with this new unit compared to my older Non Wifi unitThe new unit doesn’t seem to cook as well as my older non Wifi unit.  It doesn’t seem to push as much air and thus doesn’t get as crisp.The buttons also don’t work nearly as well.  I have a hard time getting it to respond.  The Wifi app does help with this, but when I’m standing in front of the unit, id rather push a button instead of getting out the phone or yelling at Alexa to make the changes.Overall I wish I’d kept my old 5.8 Unit instead of getting this new Wifi unit.  It just doesn’t seem to cook as good

  This product has a flush face with no physical buttons to press for your selections.  You are supposed to depress the area for your selection and the selection is supposed to light up.  You can press all you want and certain buttons may or may not work.......most cases they do not work.  For this reason, I would not recommend this product.  Save your money....look for something else.  This is a design flaw.

  I loved (note past tense) my Corsori Air Fryer. Pros:—Easy to use—Energy efficient—Versatile—Compact—AffordableCons:— A bit loud—A bit small—Lasted only ONE YEAR!!Yes. One year. And I had a voltage protector on it, as I do with ANY appliance that has a circuit board and computer. I even unplugged it after every use. I’d used it about 2-3 times a week, which is what I consider moderate usage. Anyway, about a month ago it turned off while it was running. Then on again. It was an anomaly so I just hoped it would not happen again. Yesterday I was cooking some chicken breasts in it on a 350 15 minute cycle. Near the end of the cycle it stopped and started two times, so I unplugged it and tried another outlet just in case that was the problem. I plugged it in, it started again for about , and that was it. Air fryer dead. 🙁

  Love this product! I just did a video review on youtube between this model and the Paula Deen 9.5 quart model.  There is no comparison between the 2. I am returning the Paula deen model.  The only issue I have with the Cosori Is that it is not big enough. Other than that this model is excellent! With the Paula Deen model it left certain things soggy on the bottom even after flipping halfway through cooking. This model does not even need flipping with pre fried foods such as fish sticks. I do shake in between but do not have to flip. Digital is also the way to go.  I highly recommend this brand and I use it at least 5 days a week and sometimes multiple times A-day. I can also say you are able to cook a 5 or 6 pound young chicken in this 1. You do have to push it down a little bit in the Pan to make sure it doesn't hit the heating element But I have been able to do that with no problem. Highly recommend!

  I'm really glad I bought this. I do note though, that cooking temperatures and time that automatically show up may be a bit high and long. Experiment a bit. I don't like my foods to come out really dark or nearly black, so maybe it's just me, but I find that lowering the temp by 10 degrees and the cooking time by a few minutes (depending on the food) cooks the food to my liking and the food is safely cooked. Buy a food thermometer if you have doubts.

I was very impressed with this air fryer easy to clean cooks in very little time and food taste but way too small.  I went in search of a bigger air fryer with the square basket and came across the Cosori  Wi-Fi air fryer.This is another item to add for a smart home. You may ask why do you need an air fryer with Wi-Fi, I said the same but I find that I use it very often! This app also provides cooking menus of all sorts and you can join a group via Facebook to also enhance your cooking experience.Originally there was an issue when I first purchased product, but I image like anything else when you have mass production there are sometimes flaws.

  I love this thing. Most of the air dryers have pretty bad reviews. What I like about this one is how interactive the company appears to be on reviews, so that was the deciding factor in why I chose this. I went with the WiFi version, but to be honest probably could have foregone that feature. I have yet to use anything via WiFi. This thing works great and I have made so many yummy things in it. It is easily my most used kitchen cooking gadget since I got it. Everything from bacon, chicken nuggets, chicken Parmesan, empanadas, and broccoli. We are going to do some churros this weekend. Easy to clean and it’s sized perfectly to make enough food for a family of five (usually in one or two batches, but things cook quickly).

  So far so good. I have only had the fryer for a few days. I have cooked frozen French fries (trial and error on time), pork chops and chicken wings. Chicken wings did great, pork chop a little tough but flavorful and chicken wings were the best...very juicy and tender. My only complaint is I would like a chart, and even on some of the recipes, that showed the weight of the meat used.  You can buy pork chops that are paper thin to over 1 inch thick. Cooking times are not equal and not all fryers are equal. I downloaded a chart off the internet that is a start. So I guess trial and error will be the norm until I can get used to the cooker. But overall I think it's an excellent device especially for the wife and I. Now no need to turn on the oven or cook top just for the two of us.

I've made chicken, pork, veggies, fries, and even roasted almonds and walnuts. It's basically a handy little oven on my kitchen counter. Although it took a bit of experimenting to get the right ""crispness"" level, since sometimes things can come out a bit more charred than I prefer. The cleanup isn't difficult. The baskets are dishwasher safe, and I wipe down the interior with a moist paper towel after it has cooled. I wish I had bought the smaller size though. 5.8 Quart is a bit large for two people, and takes up quite a bit of counter space. Overall, I'm very happy with this appliance.

  We used the air fryer to bake our typical frozen mini corn dogs, but it was a fail. It doesn’t look like it cooked evenly. It had a very strong Teflon smell when in use so it’s very unappetizing to eat any food made with the air fryer. The area where the nails are used to hold the handle is hard to clean. There’s tiny crevices there with high chance of food debris and grease/oil can hide. However, I did like the smart feature of being able to control it from my phone. It’s just not worth it if the food isn’t cooked evenly.

  So I was actually getting good results cooking with this air fryer. It just takes a little bit of experimenting honestly.I got this as a Christmas gift from a family member. I took really good care of it and cleaned it like instructed. One morning I was cooking bacon like I always do every morning, then I started to smell smoke and what smelt like something electrical coming from the kitchen. Big billows of smoke were coming from the air fryer and smelled like something was catching fire. I run over turn it off, and unplug the air fryer freaking out. After giving it some time to cool down I unplug it. I'm freaking out thing the food must have caught fire even though I used the same settings I always do and never had issues. I open the fryer and the bacon is fine and still slightly undercooked.That being said it could have caught my place on fire if I hadn't gotten up quickly enough and I'm very disappointed that this product didn't last. I would not even consider a replacement at this point seeing as it's not very safe in the first place.Do yourself a favor and just research other brands.

  Cons; I bought this air fryer in September. It is now December. It still has a strong plastic smell when food is cooking. I was hoping the smell would go away but it hasn't. The front plastic face plate on the basket has started to melt and is now coming off. The basket isnt staying closed it pops out and stops cooking.Pros; it cooks good! But the food has a slight off taste I think it is from the strong plastic smell. It is easy to use and easy to clean. I was mine by hand.

  I’ll admit the idea of air fryers sounded silly to me until my daughter convinced me to give it a try. So glad I did! First of all, my Corsori is beautiful and looks great on my counter. It has lots of pre-set buttons that make it easy to get started. Glad I opted for the larger 5.8 square basket, it fits 2 steaks perfectly and the extra room allows for better air flow. I’ve  used it every day since it arrived....I LOVE IT! My husband considers himself a Wings Connoisseur, and he says these are the best he’s tasted.  So far I’ve made several variations of wings, fish, meat loaf, steak, mozzarella sticks, and Brussels sprouts. Everything was crispy, juicy and delicious, quick and easy.  Seriously....what took me so long!

  I was very skeptical when I purchased this because I wasn’t familiar with the brand, but the number of reviews convinced me to take a chance, and our oven died and needed some way to cook food.  I also thought that the whole air fryer thing was a fad, I’d had a Cusinart air fryer and the Instant Pot lid (which I didn’t like at all) however I am so glad I got this.First, I love this because it really is a small convection oven and so it is so much more versatile that just crispy French fries.  Today I made cookies for my child and I and since our oven is on the fritz, I tried them in the air fryer and in 6 minutes we had something delicious!It is super easy to clean and I am thinking about getting a second one so that I can make multiple things. I love this air fryer!

  Great Air Fryer! I have literally used this EVERYDAY since I received it. Easy to clean and super easy to run. There are 2 issues I do have with it though, 1. The screws that connect the handle to the inner basket keep coming loose. 2. There is a minimal amount of steam leaking through the bottom left front of the basket. Both do not affect the usability but a little annoying. All around it's a freakin' cookin' machine!

  I’ve owned or gifted six air fryers, three Nu Waves and three Phillips. I’ve also purchased an Air Fryer XL and immediately returned it because of poor cooking. One Nu Wave broke one month after purchase. They all cooked ok. We cook completely oil free. The Cosori is easily the top choice. My standard is oil-less crimper-cut Russet potatoes which I snack on daily as part of my whole food plant based diet. The Cosori does easily the best job with the potatoes as well as Beyond Mest burgers, broccoli and anything the grandkids want. You can’t go wrong. We own two.

  I did a lot of research on Air Fryers, please allow me to tell you, you will not be disappointed. We have been using the Cosori almost every day, The recipes in the book cooks perfectly, we did the vegetables, all the meats with exception of lamb and they all cook just as instructed in the book. I love the fact when cooking chicken you do not have to flip it midway. We actually roasted a small turkey breast without the bone, and it was so moist and tender. It does not take much oil at all, less than a tablespoon.  I had purchase the Ninja airfryer and although it work sufficient, it could not come close to the Cosori. We love this product.  And to clean the basket is awesome. You do not need parchment paper for any reason. It cleans very well. The design of the product is well made. Very easy to operate. It is very easy to operate.

Why?!1) FAST2) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED ODORS3) HEALTHY (most we do is a very very very light extra virgin olive oil coating to adhere spices.4) SUPER EASY CLEAN UP!We have learned to cook every single protein at 400 and we almost always use the pre-heat. Meats take 4-5 minutes then flip then 4-5 minutes then rest 4-5 minutes. Steaks turn out phenomenal - even have a slight crust!Pork goes 6 flip 6 because we eat a 7 oz tenderloin cut.We cook fish at 400 also and .75 to 1.2 pounds generally takes 8 minutes. We usually go for 6 minutes (the standard Porto setting is 400 degrees and 6 minutes) - check the fish and then go another 2 minutes.A pound of KW Pinks takes 6 minutes (would be ok at 4-5).The flavors and juices are perfect every time.

  So the air fryer certainly lives up to its reputation and does cook items as if you fried them in oil. French fries, bacon, shrimp, fried chicken, and even grilled cheese (yes I'm sure that sounds strange) are just a few of the things off the top of my head that were cooked to perfection.This particular model comes with an easy-to-understand recipe book that is about 85% accurate. The missing 15% is that you may need to play around with the listed temps but once you find the right temp, it cooks perfectly. You can even get away with using some oil as well which many air fryers don't support.I docked a star off my rating because despite how awesome and convenient this model is, it has a few minor faults. The screws that keep the tray intact as well as the drip pan intact do loosen up, likely from the heat of the fryer. You will need to periodically tighten them. The plastic front cover of the sauce pan is also beginning to detach, again likely from the heat of repeated use. I have attached pictures showcasing the above statements.Ultimately, this air fryer has quickly become my favorite cooking tool and despite its minor faults, would definitely recommend it.

  This product is a big risk, I'd advise into looking into a more stable and thorough product.The safety hazard is the basket of the air fryer opening randomly. It can be 15 minutes into cooking, 3 minutes preheating whichever. I've made precautions and made sure it is securely closed but the problem still persists.The last incident it happened, the basket popped out and fell off the counter. The basket was in separate pieces and I burned my hand trying to pick it up. On top of that I lost the food I was preparing and had to prepare some more.

  My friend finally convinced me to buy an air fryer after a year later. I chose this one because I got to use it at his house for a couple of days. I’m so glad I bought it!! No more wasting oil when deep frying! Also, using the air fryer is much healthier. However, I do feel like I have to play around with the temperature and time when cooking certain foods. Definitely had to check on my food from time to time to make sure it wasn’t burnt. FYI, I did over cook and burned some fries. Also, I don’t get the same exact texture of the crispiness as if I were to use oil (of course because it’s an air fryer). Other than that, I think it’s a great product!

  This is the best Air Fryer I have ever had, and I've gone through a few. This COSORI WiFi Air Fryer works miracles of food. I have baked, fried, and reheated using this unit. Baked things like single-serve pizza slices, potatoes, chicken, etc. Made fries, onion rings, chicken nuggets, and much more.The issue I have with the unit, however, is a similar issue reported by another reviewer, wherein the front panel buttons are not entirely responsive. We can sometimes get them to respond, using the full pad of your finger, rather than a finger tip. It's annoying sometimes to get things to start due to this, and at times, just resort to using the app to start the food cooking. All-in-all though, the issues are minor compared to the great benefit of not having to heat oil, and also wait for the oil to cool after. And the added health benefit of not having to ingest so much oily food is a plus. Highly recommend this product. Hopefully the company releases a v2 unit with more responsive buttons, or a fix for this one.

I have put it in the dishwasher and hand washed it. I have not had any issues with smoke coming from the unit, but do I clean after every use.What I DON'T like/hate, the push/screen buttons are hard to operate. Sometimes they work, sometimes I have to repeatedly push a program button touching it lightly or putting some pressure on any buttons just to get it to work. That is very frustrating.

  I researched and asked friends who owned air fryers many questions before finally deciding to buy one. I am so happy that I did! I also wasn't sure if I wanted a smaller one, but I am happy I did not go that route. Although it's just me I am cooking for most of the time, this is a great size because I like to food prep and it doesn't matter if you are cooking a little or a lot. I have boiled eggs, made various styles of chicken breast and wings, and various vegetables so far. Everything has turned out great and the process is much healthier than how I used to cook! Big bonus: The unit is very easy to use and easy to clean!

Looks sleek and nice in the kitchen.  First thing we tried were buffalo chicken wings.  Now we are spoiled, we will never get them outside of the home again because they were pure PERFECTION.  Crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the outside.  French fries perfectly crips on the outside, tender inside.  Now we plan meals around the air fryer.

Overall as a mother this is making things easier when it comes to getting meals together. It's a little weird to get used to at first and it actually makes a lot of noise, but so far what we have cooked has been really tasty. Its nice not having to bust out the cast iron AND turn on the oven to make chicken for the kids. SOOOO...the million dollar question.....is it worth it? Is it going to step my kitchen game up? I bought it because it was on sale and my mom budget brain wouldn't let me pay full price when I do have a perfectly good stove for cooking. I'd say if you don't mind spending the money OR you buy it on sale like me..... it's a good investment (so far that is). It's saved me time in the kitchen which helps when it comes to nighttime routines. So for me, it's worth it.

I stayed away from cooking fried foods because I’m lazy. This Completely takes the time and mess out of frying.  Amazing.One little piece of advice though: Don’t add any oil to the food unless you’re going to stand by and babysit the cooking process.  I discovered early on that extra oil isn’t necessary, and it will overcook your food very quickly.

    Way better than our first air fryer
  
",5.0,Adriana V,"Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought this for my husband. We used to have a small round one that was starting to tarnish from overuse. He used his little one everyday so I knew it would be a good investment to shell out more money for a quality one. Hubby is so happy with this. It cooks faster and gets hotter than the other one. Because it has more space being square-shaped instead of round, his food comes out crispier and better. The old one was smaller so sometimes things came out a little soggy where food touched/ overlapped - but not with this one. We can use it for everything and it cooks so quick. No need for oil. He likes that it's digitized - the old one just had a timer dial. The only bummer is that I got the black one. They were out of the white ones and our kitchen is white. When I went back for the white one, it cost A LOT more than the black. Husband said that it's not worth that much money to get a different color. I'm just nit-picking at this point though. Everything else was positive.

  Love the capacity, cooks quickly.  Clean up is not easy when washing the basket especially the sides.  The buttons to change the temp doesn’t work and when I tried calling customer service (several times) I never reached anyone.  Now the warranty has expired.  I still use it using a preset with the right temperature but have to keep pushing a preset button to get the time needed since I can’t change the temp manually.  Would I purchase again?  Probably not because of the design of the basket (the sides) very hard to clean and the buttons to change time and temp never worked.  Lastly customer service need to answer the phone.

  We absolutely LOVE this air fryer. It has helped so much especially in the summer months when we don't want to heat the whole house with the oven. About 9 months in the handle on the basket broke off and when I contacted customer service they provided us a replacement and were very prompt in all of their responses to us. Very pleased. From our experience, it would definitely be wise to always be checking the screws on the basket handle as they do tend to loosen. But considering how much we use it a broken handle and loose screws are minor problems. Would definitely buy again!

I’ve also discovered that this machine is fantastic for heating up left overs — much better texture than microwaved and not that much longer.  The basket is huge and rectangular so it can easily make enough for a small family. It’s a large device to leave on the counter,  not too heavy which is good but not flimsy either.

  This air fryer is money well spent for both your health and wallet! For $120, this air fryer is amazing and your waist will thank you. With air fryer foods, you can have a similar texture of fried foods without all the oil. Most recipes I've made in this air fryer, I haven't used more than 1-2 tbps of oil, tops. Usually I don't even use oil, just some cooking spray.I've made fries (obviously) both fresh and frozen, panko fish for fish tacos, wings, bacon, fried chicken and even roasted a full chicken! Everything comes out amazing! Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I was skeptical to buy one of these things, but after a lot of research I finally caved and I'm so glad I finally purchased one. Don't think you can only make food in the air fryer that are normally fried. You can pretty much use this air fryer for anything you'd put in your oven.This is the second air fryer I purchased. The first one was cheaper and after I tried it out, I liked it so much I invested some more and got this Cosori. It's bigger and had some nice extra features the cheaper one didn't. It also comes with an awesome recipe book. I'm so glad I finally bought one. I've convinced my coworkers to do the same after showing them some of these pics in my review.

  Update: Never received the replacement basket. Still don't know where it is after 22 emails back and forth. Yesterday I noticed that now the nonstick coating is peeling off of the inside of the bottom basket. It's been used maybe 10 times. I have requested a refund and that has been approved, which will take at least 2 weeks, if they stay on schedule. It has been a frustrating experience dealing with the inferior quality of the device as well as poor service. At this point I can only conclude that the device is meant to be a throwaway, use it a couple of years, then toss it and buy a new one. Definitely not for me and not what I was looking for. I will update if there are any issues with the refund. By the way, your refund is a gift card, not reimbursement.It cooks great tasting food but I have a significant issue with the screws that hold the handle onto the inner basket coming loose after each use. I suspect the expansion and contraction of the metal is causing it but surely there's a better way to secure the handle since this fail point could cause injury to the user. People that love this machine are going to say so what, just tighten the screws, but that shouldn't be good enough for anybody. From what I have read, this seems to be fairly common and my daughter's machine has the same issue. I don't have high hopes that the replacement basket I requested will perform any better but I will update if it does.

Fortunately I was not disappointed. As long as you’re willing to play around with settings and try to make things a few times without expecting perfection off the bat, you will be happy! Read what works for others online (Pinterest is great).I use this to cook an assortment of foods, but also enjoy using it to reheat almost anything I can.My boyfriends only discrepancy is that he expected it to be a quicker way to heat everything up (he’s an instapot guy...) so don’t expect everything to cook instantly, but it is a much healthier way of cooking. I will also say that many foods I make have a very short cook time.I will also say that I am so obsessed with this product that I bring it with me to a lot of locations, and find myself wishing I had it when It’s not with me lol.Would buy again!

  Buying this was such a great purchase! Completely changed my view in cooking! I’m still getting used to it and how it works but I’m in love! I did realize that it makes a really BIG difference to preheat the air fryer! It takes 5 minutes, but it is definitely worth it! I love reheating pizza I can’t even taste the difference from when I bought it! The noise is low and at times gets a little higher but it goes back to being low, nothing to loud. It’s so very easy to clean the basket however the inside always needs a little bit of work but be careful what you clean it with because you don’t want to damage the coating inside. And be very careful with the basket when it’s hot I have burned myself a few times when I get distracted well taking the food out!

  Changed my life! If you don't have an air fryer, GET ONE! This Cosori is fantastic because it is larger than the round ones. I have another air fryer, which was a gift and I loved it, but smaller. Just needed a second one for our 2nd home. And I wanted bigger. The ease of use, faster cooking times, better flavors and healthier cooking makes me happy every time I use. No hot kitchen from using your stove oven in the summer! Baked potatoes (any potatoes) come out fantastic. Meats (chicken, pork chops, steaks) are delicious and moist/juicy. I haven't baked anything in it, but plan on doing. Once you start using, you won't ever want to turn your oven on. Can't say enough about air frying, and this model is fantastic!

  The food comes out amazing in this fryer.  But within the first week we noticed the basket would esaily dislodge itself, popping open, and the fryer would turn off.  Sometime it would just pop an inch or two.  And sometimes it would straight up eject out and fall on the floor.  We even tested on ways we could push the basket in, adding pressure up, down, or side to side.  Anyone who lived through the infamous blinking Nintendo screen will know what I'm talking about!  Then we'd hold our breath to see if it was going to pop itself out.  Sometimes it worked.....sometimes not.Over the past couple of months we kept saying ""Should we return this thing?  The food is great but it keeps popping out"".  Well today it finally killed itself . Despite being at the back of the counter with about 1.5 feet of clearance in front of it, it ejected onto the floor.  This time, in addition to ruining my food all over the floor, some plastic snapped off and the cage got bent and no longer fits into the housing.

  This is basically a small convection oven.  As such it is much more efficient than my large oven when making small meals for one or two people.  It also replaces the frying pan and eliminates the grease splatter on the stove cook top.  The french fries are great and it does well in cooking things like chicken leg quarters.  I wondered if this would just be another semi useless kitchen gadget, but it has proven very useful.  I use it almost every day.

  I loved the way this Air Fryer worked.  Easy to use, makes great food, but the buttons stopped working after three months.  The basket is hard to clean, and if you don't clean it thoroughly every time, it gets gunked up.  The square basket size is definitely better than the round ones, you can fit more into it.

  I had high hopes for this air fryer - especially after all the great reviews. Unfortunately, the touch screen doesn't work.I even got a replacement unit, and the second machine had the same issue. Some buttons would not work at all and others would only work if you were lucky enough to push them the right way after trying 5 or 6 times. Others have had this same issue, so I think there must be a certain batch of these that are just defective.Cross your fingers if you decide to order, and maybe your machine won't have this problem.

  I had a small AF which I found basically useless. After watching ProHomeCook on youtube and researching, I ventured into the AF game with the Cosori primarily cause it cleans up so well based on the reviews.Air circulation is great, super easy to use pre-existing programs or set your own and best reason - EASY TO CLEAN. Microwave + Air Fryer makes food (especially Trader Joe's Chicken Pot Pie and Sheperd's Pie) taste so much better without the 45-60 minute wait for a stove to heat up and bake the food. I have baked lasagna, ziti, chicken, fish, steak, appetizers, eggs and burgers...so far. I prefer steak on the outdoor grill but I was able to get a very good medium rare steak straight from the fridge.About Cosori Support - I received as a gift the wrong size cooking accessories (for the 3 QT unit) for XMAS and Cosori support stepped up and arranged a replacement (long story but the seller (ahem, WalMart marketplace) would not replace/refund). They were fast and efficient, what you want in customer support.Highly RECOMMEND

  Cosori stand behind its product! I had a concern with my airfryer and their customer service team did not disappoint me. They are very responsive to my concern! The product is really good, the food that I cooked from it is very tasty and crunchy, like it was deep fried. I had this thing called “enoki mushroom test”. I have another airfryer (Nuwave XL airfryer) and I couldn’t get a crunchy enoki mushroom from it. It is precisely for that reason that I bought this and give this a try. I did not go for the very expensive Philips airfryer. Why would you pay more if you can get the desired output for less? So anyway, I managed to get a crispy enoki mushroom here - and surely it passed my enoki mushroom test! :) I rarely post reviews and I feel I need to post a review for this product because it deserves it!

Pongo a cocinar y solo espero el momento de revisarlo y luego al final lo saco y listo.Los contra: no todo queda bien en ella, no asi un bistek de res, queda fatal, o un pescado.

  I would have given this 5 stars, BUT.....The Recipe book states to flip the chicken wings half way trough the cooking time limit. The Pre set for Chicken is 25 Min at 380. There is no warning to stop ad flip said chicken. The Pre set for Fries is also 25 Min at 380, Guess what, it automatically pause at 13 Min, and tells you to ""Shake the Fries"". So, when I cooked Wings on the pre set Fries setting...……….PERFECT! I would have given this 5 stars , had it the ""Flip"" warning at 13 minutes for Chicken. No smoke, very little odor when cooking Chicken. Very good product. I also cooked Quiche, again...……...perfect.

  I'm an overthinker.  I watched way too many videos and read way too many reviews before deciding on my Cosori.  I purchased an air fryer with the thought that circulating air is going to dry out meat and taking the fat out of fried foods is going to make them like cardboard.  Wrong.  i was most concerned with vegetables which it does amazing on.  Crispy kale chips, awesome roasted broccoli and cauliflower, brussell sprouts etc.  I finally tried meats and have not been disappointed.  So far I have only tried tilapia and chicken breast and both were wonderful.  Looking forward to trying more.The Cosori is easy to use, very self explanatory but comes with a nice directions booklet as well as a good time chart for cooking the basics and a recipe book.  It's super easy to clean at this point but I've only had it a couple of weeks.  The only problem I have at all is the plastic latch that moves to allow you to pull the basket out; on mine it takes some manipulation to push it forward.  I think I probably have a faulty one but I've learned to deal with it.In spite of the plastic latch this air fryer is a great purchase.  I wish I had gotten one a long time ago.

  Alright so I didn't really know too much about Air Fryers until recently. Picked this up around Christmas time and it's really a fantastic appliance to get low-fat fried foods. We've done home style fries, sweet potato fries, chicken wings, you name it! It all came out great and very tasty. It's nice not having to use oil and we know it's healthier. Did a lot of research and this is the model you'll want for just sheer capacity alone. A lot of the other air fryers just don't have enough room in them. This one does. Highly recommend!

  I don’t normally write reviews but this one was review- worthy! This is a must buy! I have probably made chicken wings in this 3 times a week since I got it and they are the best wings ever. Hands down. So far I have made, chicken wings, bacon, asparagus, salmon, chicken, grilled cheese and they all have turned out perfect every time. There is no learning curve and it comes with easy to follow directionsThe best part is it comes out of the box ready to use!

  Let me say in a nutshell  without writing a lengthy  review it is simply the best I had used so far the price I paid for the cheap brand why I say cheap brand the teflon coating started peeling off within three months of usage , the residuefrom cooking chicken drumsticks etc was hard to remove by simple washing, in contrast this one is a breeze to clean. apart from this it evenly cooks the food of course  you have to turn it one time that is it. The timer for each variety of food is on the dot. Previous one I had to increase the temperature and the minutes for the food to be cooked evenly. thank you COSORI FOR THE WONDERFULL PRODUCT.

  This appliance has changed my life because I no longer have to clean the stovetop, convection-traditional oven, or microwave-convection oven. This does not fry. It is a convection oven. It is so easy to clean by hand but is also dishwasher safe.  It is large enough for a family of four. It is easy to convert recipes by reducing the temperature and time, but the recipe book is terrific. It looks good on the countertop. I will never fry again. Did I mention it is easy to clean? 😊

  This was the first meal I made - Cajun Salmon and prosciutto-wrapped asparagus. I really hate fish but my husband got this huge lake salmon and I thought it would be a good thing to try with the new air fryer.  The asparagus was in the cookbook that came with it and the salmon recipe I found on Allrecipes. Cooked the asparagus first, which was a little fussy but it turned out perfect. I've never cooked fish that wasn't breaded, deep fried and frozen, so the salmon was a challenge - I didn't know big fish have scales - LOTS of them! But I followed the simple recipe and had to cook it a little longer than it said, but after 11 minutes plus a 2 minute rest these very thick fillets were perfect. Tender and juicy and didn't taste FISHY. I made a sauce with homemade mayo and Brava sauce. We just had to dig in, which is why I forgot to take any before-eating photos. The meal was nearly done when I remembered to snap a quick pix.My only complaint would be that the paper bound cookbook that came with it disintegrated the very first time I used it. Pages 15 to 54 just fell out when I opened it.

  This thing is the bomb!Every I've made gas turned out great. Porkchops come out 100% cooked and not 1 second overcooked. Whole chicken? No problem, if you get the spices right you can make a whole chicken juicier, tastier, and bigger than whatever rottiserie chicken at the grocery stores. Cornish hens are the bomb and you don't even need to know how to bake, you just have to follow recipes.The recipe book that comes with is a nice starter and you should try it, lots of good stuff there. However, you can find lots of easy recipes online too.Don't cheap out and get the smaller one, get the bigger one, even if you are only cooking for one. Why? Because if you want to make, say, more than one batch of steaks or a whole chicken the bigger one is going to be the best one.Super easy to clean, easy to use.Don't forget to preheat. All those reviews saying this doesn't work are due to not preheating.If you are a single guy who struggles in the kitchen and want good home made meals that taste like you know what you are doing this is it, as long as you can read and follow instructions you'll be fine.Highly recommended.

I used it about 1-2 times a week, but then in December 2020, the buttons were getting temperamental specifically the temp/time button which is a big deal.  I couldn't adjust the temperature or length of cook time.  I had emailed Cosori since the Customer Service was unavailable due to the pandemic.  I did not receive a response.  I called their customer service & finally got to talk to someone.  Since I'm within the warranty timeframe, the issue is covered.  I had to send pics of my order details, a video of it not working & the sticker on the bottom of the unit with the batch number.  I'm not sure if they'll send me a replacement, but I'll update my review with the outcome.

  I originally received a damaged product, but it was replaced within a week. I have had it less than a month, and am very happy with the results.  I've cooked wings, steaks, chicken, burgers, fries, veggies, salmon, etc. It is not too loud, but does make noise from the fan. I have not had any issues with excessive steam, as some other users experienced. The only thing I have noticed, is the cooking times are more of a suggestion, especially for things that may very greatly in size. A thick cut bone in steak is going to take at least double the time for the preset.

  The fryer is easy to look at but the positives end there.

It's easy to use, very spacious, easy to clean, and everything we've made has been fast and delicious.From a smart home perspective, we're finding the app is more useful than the Alexa connectivity. There may be more to it than I realize, but there's very little guidance as to what it will actually do with Alexa, where the app is simple, clean, and easy.I can't recommend this unit enough; if you're in the market for an air fryer, this is the one.

  One of my best purchase. I use this all of the time. Works very well and cooks good and fast. Wifi comes in handy if you're away from home or not near the air fryer. Cleans fairly easy and even comes with a recipe or instructions book. The only bad thing I can say about it, is that is very loud when it goes off or when you press the buttons. Definitely would recommend.

  I gifted myself the 5.8 in red, for Christmas.  I am very pleased so far - still figuring out a few things along the way.  It does provide a very easy way to prepare meals, and the results are some very tasty dinners with hardly any clean-up.  I can see this being a healthier way to eat, as there is little need to add oils to prep - example, chicken cutlets, eggplant parmigiana, without having to cook on the stove top with splattering oil -

  4 stars It's an easy and basic air fryer. I use it all the time and it works great. The only thing I would have done differently is probably not choose it because of the Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi can only be used on a 2G network which nowadays everything's 4G or 5G 🙄The only option it tells you is to call your network provider to use 2G which I don't understand why anyone would do that 🤔Overall no complaints just can't use my Wi-Fi with it.

  What a game changer. Perfect size bin, easy to clean, and very easy to use. I love the touch screen and presets but having the option to set my own time and tempature. I love that it pauses when you remove the basket to shake. Only downfall is you can only set the timer by 10's and not 5's. So you can't do 375°. If you can I haven't figured out how to do that yet. It's a bit loud when cooking and buttons are loud when pressed. But not a huge deal. The sleek design is really nice too!

  I wasn't sure I'd use this much, but after having it for a few weeks I'm not sure how I managed to cook without it. I don't like to spend a lot of time cooking, so this has been a huge help. I've made chicken wings and buffalo wings. Fish. Roasted Brussels sprouts. Homemade potato wedges and fries. Even the kids admit that store bought fries and nuggets taste better when I make them in the air fryer. Extremely time saving when I'm hungry and don't want to spend a lot of time cooking...and cleanup is ALMOST as simple as rinsing it out (light scrubbing and the nonstick surfaces are easily cleaned). I also prep a few days worth of meals. Between this and my instant pot, my meal prep time has been drastically reduced.

It ruins the cooking experience when you can taste that in your food.  No amount of seasoning can hide it!  The times work well, and the size is nice.

  AMAZING PRODUCT!I’ve been wanting an air fryer for a couple months now, and since going vegetarian this is the best kitchen gadget I have invested in. There are so many different things that I can use it for! So far I’ve made tortilla chips, fries, sweet potato fries, roasted potatoes, and bread! I’m obsessed! Pros: super easy to clean bc of the nonstick surface, doesn’t heat up the entire kitchen like an oven, amazing safety features, “high tech” for only $120, looks nice on the counter, variety of uses, great recipe book included, awesome shake feature, FAST COOKING, pretty big basket!Cons: temperature doesn’t go lower than 170°F, have to be more cautious as to not burn food, the smell from past foods sometimes remains in the fryer even after cleaning but it’s not a bad smell, more like that grease smell that’s always around fast food fryers, pretty loud button sounds and beeps (cant cook at midnight without waking the whole house up)Overall this is the best purchase I’ve made for my kitchen and when shopping for new kitchen gadgets I will definitely come back to the brand first.

  I really wanted to like this air fryer, but unfortunately the buttons on the fryer didn't work 99% of the time every once and a while I would finally get a button to work. I thought maybe it was a one off issue and tried it two more times but all three of the units I received had the same issue and only one of them was able to get connected to the app which allowed for it to be used but without the main buttons on the unit working I couldn't keep it

  Wasn't sure what to expect. Had held off on buying an air fryer, because I didn't really understand them well. A friend's wife kept telling me that she uses it all the time and how great hers was. Actually saw her use hers one weekend and thought time to do this. Bought the Cosori and love it. I thought what the heck, I'll make buffalo chicken wings. Verdict: tastes just like the restaurant. Again, I didn't understand how an air fyer worked, so I thought there was hot oil at bottom and air would circulate throughout. Nope, not how it works. No oil. But I will tell you this: those wings tasted every bit like they were 'fried'. They were delicious. Highly recommend.

  All I can say is --if you're a foodie, you need to have this in your kitchen!!! It's quick to learn the device (presets are built in - so press a button and your selected meat or other foods are done)...and it is easy to clean (the tray basket pops out and any drippings are a breeze to remove from the nonstick surface). Lastly, the cooking speed is fast and thorough (because the heat circulates around the food). The only thing you have to be ready for is the operating asdound of the device...it can be loud (but what do you expect from a unit having a strong fan to move that heat around). Look, its versatile and sturdy...a rare thing in today's market of kitchen appliances. Make the investment...you will not be sorry!!

Bluetooth is your second way to control it.  If your WiFi dies on you, you can’t use the fryer.  Make sure to use the preheat setting as recommended by the instructions, otherwise you cooking twice the time recommended for your choice of meat.  Also customer service is nice.

  A year ago, I purchased the newest modal of Cosori Air Fryer (without the wi-fi feature) and immediately enjoyed using it.  I am almost totally blind and so had bump buttons placed on the different settings on the front panel and thus made it easy to use.  Its larger square size basket is roomy and a good shape to hold a whole chicken or for laying out a row of veggies.  Its simplicity and quick-cooking have made it more convenient and fun.  I also should mention the company’s excellent customer service.  Recently, the Cosori Air Fryer stopped working.  I contacted the company and was offered a refund but I wanted a replacement and they obliged.  So, I got a replacement within a couple of days and happily am using it every day once more.  They asked for the old one to be returned to inspect and that tells me that the company is a conscientious one.

  I am very disappointed in the quality and build of this airfryer. I've had this product since Christmas (~2 months) and within that time, the plastic handle on the basket has cracked, with plastic breaking off in chunks and slivers along the back side of the handle. In addition, the basket often pops out during the cooking process, creating the need to put a heavy object in front of the door to keep it closed. Based on reviews I have read, others have also experienced this issue. The Cosori brand unfortunately seems to have some quality controls issues with the build of their pieces. Once you figure out the best settings to use based on the food you are cooking, this airfryer makes tasty and juicy food, however the quality issues with the product overshadow the positives. Based on the price-point of this model in comparison to other airfryers on the market with good reviews, this product should quality should be higher and these issues should not be occurring.

I pre-heated the unit by pressing the pre-heat icon, which goes on for 5-minutes, then pressed the shrimp icon, and 6-minutes later I had DELICIOUS shrimp!All I did to season was dump the defrosted shrimp in a bowl, spray them with olive oil, dumped garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper on them. That's it!The tray is a bit small as-is, you can likely only fit a few adult-sized cutlets in there, so hopefully I can find a rack for the tray. There's a lot of ""dead space"" at the top of the tray. You'd likely be better off making chicken stripes, instead of cutlets, and going that route.Anyhow, this air fryer is AMAZING.

The Cosori air fryer will set the time and temperature based on the recipe I have selected. I always have the ability to tweak the time and temperature to my liking. The buttons on the front will set the time and temperature based on the food type, although they are not to any certain recipe.I have a friend that has a different brand air fryer, and the bottom of it got so hot that it cracked her countertop.

I suggest  tightening the three screws each week to avoid this happening to anyone else. other than that, nice fryer. Adding to this review. I contacted customer support and in less than a week they sent me a replacement basket at no charge. They have a great customer service team.

    Basket slides out, major burn risk!

  I have had this product less than 6 months and have used it maybe 25 times.  The basket no longer stays shut and will spontaneously slide out.  Twice its fallen onto the floor which poses as a burn risk not only from the basket itself but also the food and grease.  I have used this product as directed so this is a design/product flaw.  The machine will not run unless the drawer is propped shut.  I am very disappointed!  A very big waste of money for what is niw pretty much a useless item.  Go with a different product!

  I've bought two of these, one for myself and one for my parents. Mine is fantastic but the one I bought my parents seems to be defective for two reasons.  1) The control panel intermittently doesn't respond and I have to press really hard on the buttons. 2) The screws in the tray are stripped which causes them to frequently fall out. This means the handle is now only connected to the tray via a single screw because the other screws do not stay attached. Since we cannot use the tray the whole air fryer is practically unusable. My parents have only had their air fryer for 6 months.

This thing is great!  Easy to use. Food is awesome. I even made a steak in it that I’d say was 90% as good as a grilled one. Indoor...with no real prep work...in 10 minutes. Chicken comes out juicy inside, crispy outside. Kids love it and use it often as well. And a favorite thing for me is reheating cold pizza, left overs. It does a much better job than a microwave of reheating but not over drying. It’s pretty awesome. If you’re reading this and have been debating it, get it.

  This air fryer is beyond amazing!  Do you want perfect wings, super crispy?  Well this is what you need.  I never knew everything you could make in this!

Veggies, whole chickens, fish it does it all.  The thing I think I like most about it, is reheating fried foods... Your chicken, fries or whatever is brought back to life.  We get to go fries, refrigerate, and use the air fryer to bring it back to life.  THEY TASTE BETTER THEN THEY DID WHEN THEY WERE FIRST BOUGHT!  I kid u not.

  I have had this for a while now and although I believe it cooks ok, there are some design flaws.  Worst being if you try to pull the draw out slightly to turn food around, be prepared for the draw to fully slide out onto the floor.  There is nothing that holds the draw in place when not fully locked in, so if you open it partially  be prepared for it to fall off the counter and onto the floor.  Second is washing it.  I don't have a dishwasher so I have to clean it the old fashioned way which is rather difficult because of the vented sides. But my revert back to main main complaint that the draw falls out and my has become so bent from falling that I have to use a screwdriver to release the basked from the main tray

  This is my first air fryer and it works great! 11 simple presets and easy adjustments for recipes you find online. Comes with a one year warranty but if you register it within two weeks of purchase you get a two year warranty. The 5.8 quart capacity is nice and I wouldn't want anything smaller. It has 1,700 watts of cooking power, cleans easily, sleek look and well made. I highly recommend this product and merchant.

  This fryer lasted a mere 8 months before it became garbage. Cooked food well however, the screws would constantly becomes loose on the basket. Easy to tighten so wasn't a huge bother. But now the basket won't click in anymore, in the last month we've had to really give it a good shove to click in. Tonight the basket literally shot out of the air fryer onto my floor. I can't believe I spent this much money on something that didn't even last a year.

  So far, I've only made chicken wings with this machine.  Best chicken wings I've had in a very long time.  Absolutely amazing tasting and simple to make.  Cleanup is super simple too as the basket is dishwasher safe.  I can fit about 8 wings in there and cook them in 30 min.  I tried to make 20 wings at once, but they took nearly an hour and they weren't quite as good.  So it is possible in a pinch, but I recommend making fewer at a time.

After driving my self crazy, having the price going up along the way and trying to decide which model to buy when I decided on a brand, ""Phillips"" way to many models, very confusing, I switched gears and bought the 5,8 quart Cosori  because of the size and price , more than $100 less, and I'm very happy I did. First off I'm not an oven person, I grill and anything I oven, fries, egg rolls, and any frozen products just tastes blah. But when I use this air fryer its awesome and it's so easy. Preheat, through in stuff, press the frozen button, flip or shake when it tells you another beep, done 100% better than an oven and way faster. It's easy to clean and it's just great! I love it!

I absolutely LOVE how well vegetables come out and how quickly. We have only had it for a month and have enjoyed several meals we have not tried before.

  There’s definitely a learning curve but I have found that my food gets really crispy even without the cooking spray addition the user manual recommends, which I love!

It is quite a bit larger than I anticipated so it’s been hard to find a storage area in my kitchen and it takes up a fair amount of counter space.

  I got the WiFi model but didn't use the Wifi. We first tried the french fries using fresh potatoes. Followed their recipe and instruction. The fries seemed like steamed after 28 minutes, then we cooked for another 15 minutes, still they were limp and soft. I tried frozen fries too but they were the same. Then we tried to cook a brussels sprout following their recipe that calls for 5 minutes of preheating and 8-10 minutes of air frying. The brussels sprout were uncooked so I gave another 15 minutes, they seemed cooked but not crispy at all so we put them in oven to get a bit crispy. The whole process took about 40 minutes. It's lot easier to just roast them.If you want to use it, don't expect to get crispy foods and figure out how to use it in combination with other means of cooking to get the flavor and taste you want.

  I bought this product in May to replace a cheaper air fryer that had given up on me. I searched and thought the Corsi had some nice features and good reviews, so I took a chance on it. It worked great for a month or so then its buttons lost functionality. As of right now, I cook everything at 177 degrees Celcius in 15 minute or less intervals. I do this because the touch screen does not work no matter how hard or gentle I press the buttons. I can't change the temperature, time, or scale. I saw that a number of customers had this same issue. I really like having an air fryer. I work a lot and it's good to be able to whip up dinner for myself and my child without much effort. I will not purcahse another one of these. I think I will just go to Target and see what they have to offer. Cheers to the people with functioning Corsi air fryers but if you're still in the market ther there are other options.

  I absolutely love this thing!! Best kitchen gadget I've ever bought. I've made cornbread, hard boiled eggs, muffins, hamburgers, chicken wings and thighs. hotdogs, pizza, and of course french fries, tater tots among other goodies. Everything comes out great and I've only scratched the surface.... I have become an airfrying addict!🤣

  This is a very cheaply made product. After 2 months all the screws were falling out and I kept having had to screw back in. Last Sunday was the final straw. I was making chicken wings, and carefully pulled the basket out and the handle came completely off and I not have grease burns on my right foot. Total piece of junk I notified the company and demanded a full replacement of the air fryer. I will never buy anything from them again. Don’t waste your money . Didn’t even last 4 months. Garbage product

  I think the problem with an ""air fryer"" is that you aren't literally frying, and so the illusion that you are eating delicious, healthier stuff is true in terms of healthier, but not nearly as delicious as frying something.  So my crockpot and oven and smoker will get a lot more duty than this thing.  Fad.

  We’ve enjoyed using the Cosori Air Fryer, I wish it were larger but it is what it is, we’ll just have to deal with that.  The first thing we tried was the Pigs in Blanket, which turned out like pieces of charcoal.  I think the instructions said to cook at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, either the temp is too high or too long.  I tried 400 for 3 minutes which was perfect, so experiment.  Over all very happy.

  3-4qts too small, 8qt takes up too much counter space and puts off too much heat in your kitchen. The Cosori is well-made and sturdy. The square pan is so much better than a round pan. Detachable basket is a must. And I really love the additional pan liners they give you. Highly recommend!

  Absolutely Loved the chicken wings (no oil, just salt, pepper, and garlic)... and mushrooms (lemon juice, garlic, salt & pepper)... French fries need a little work on timing not to get dried out... I appreciate the “shake” feature to remind you to turn items midway through cooking, as well as the preheat function. Clean up of the basket and it’s catch-bin is very easy, and the basket cools very quickly.Can’t wait to try many of the recipes in the included recipe book!

  This air fryer is the best I've had so far. The takeaways are its a bit difficult to clean and you cant cook food according to the times provided in the book. I cooked chicken drumsticks at the temperature and time suggested by the manufacturer and the first batch was slightly burnt and the meat was a little dry. So for the next batch I took the chicken out 4 minutes earlier and it was very crispy, juicy and was thoroughly cooked.

  I love this air fryer. The only thing is the material seems cheap. In May I purchased it multiple times I had to tighten the handle and the handle came off and melted a piece of it. I purchased the extended warranty since it’s digital it wouldn’t work anymore. The manufacturer is aware of this issue or something similar but they was out of handles and offered my a $25 amazon credit. After talking to them I contacted amazon and they were amazing. They offered a refund or a new air fryer. I took the air fryer and send it the next day. I love the build in alexia since I work from home I have her to preheat it before actually going on lunch. I’m thinking about buying a second one for backup. Make sure you purchased the extended warranty you will NEED it.

  This device would be relatively easy to use...if the touch display worked. Within a few minutes of setting it up, I found the touch control panel to be unusable and downloaded the (primitive) app.The app does the bare minimum--it does not offer noteworthy customization or complex custom presets. (It would not be difficult, from a software engineering perspective, to allow multiple temperature settings in one preset, so this is disappointing at best.)The screws on the basket handle required frequent tightening starting after the first month of using this. The product isn't complete garbage, but it wasn't worth the money.Clean up is actually very easy with the device, and the cooking method works as advertised, but I would still rather have gone with a more reputable brand (like I usually do these days). It's most unfortunate because this would have been my favorite kitchen appliance, had they finished the job. Another great idea ruined by shoddy craftsmanship and uninspired software development.

  There is not enough to say about the world of air frying! I have used this gem at least once a week; whereas most other cooking appliances are used once every couple of months (crockpot, pressure cooker, etc.). That has earned a prime spot on my kitchen counter.The recipe book that comes with this one is great. For those who like salmon, there is an excellent recipe for you.As far as features, this fryer has all of the features that most others have on the market. The only annoying thing I've noticed is I'm still getting used to the button settings. If you do the wrong sequence, or press the power button like I do, then it will reset and you have to start over. For some reason my brain is trained to hit power instead of the play/pause button.All-in-all such a great investment for everyone's kitchen!

  New to airfryer but so far it's great. Clean up is easy. Using machine is pretty self explanatory, although the manual has helpful hints. We haven't experienced too much with recipes yet but everything that we would normally put in microwave for our toddler (chicken nuggets, pizza rolls, etc) we've been air frying instead and it comes out crispy. We also used it to eat up leftovers (fries, eggrolls, etc) which is nice because it's not soggy.

  I've had this product since April 2020.  Since then it has lost some screws holding the basket together. It's now a safety issue. It also has began to leak smoke as it cooks.After my review COSORI tried to make it right.  So good customer service.  They offered new machine/fix but it wasn't worth the time.  This is an entry level air-fryer.  You get what you pay for with air-fryers.

  Smaller meals are fast and consistent. I kept notes on everything I cooked with suggestions for improving it next time. This thing is really consistent and versatile! Every few uses, I recommend letting it cool down, lay it on it's back and wipe down the burner and interior with damp paper towels. Be conscientious about not scratching the nonstick basket and pan. They clean so easily with a soft brush or sponge. Just being fairly thin sheet metal, I often have time to wash them before the food is cool enough to eat. If this air fryer only lasts a year, I'll buy another one. Yeah, I like it and use it that much.

  I was hoping that this airfryer would stand the test of time when I ordered it. The ""touchscreen"" is a plasticy film that is really just confusing to use. They offer an app mainly centered at using the preheat feature. With the preheat feature on the app, you will have to click to confirm on the actual airfryer unit before it starts, therefore, the app is really just useless. There are many modes you can click on the fryer which do no different than just manually setting the temperature and time. The fryer cooks food just fine, like any regular one.Overall, this product seemed cheaply made for a high price. They tried to overcomplicate things on the interface which causes a clutter of useless buttons.

In the end, the cook time ends up the same but less fat than fried food.  That was important to me.  My 15 year old uses is every day to cook her lunch vs. me having to make it for her.  Bonus! I will now eat more of a variety of food with this!! So far, I really like it.  I've read reviews that it's hard to clean but I think it has been very easy.  That includes cheese sticks.

I love fish, but we did not like to prepare it because of the house smell in the regular stove, however with our Cosori Air fryer, we just take it out to our patio and cook the fish outside. For the rest of the foods, the come out much healthier since you don't have to use to much of the oils....we actually just spray a little avocado oil and follow some of the recipes in the book that is included with the product.

  I have had three air fryers since this past Xmas. The first one was Cook's, the one they advertised on TV, it had a 30 day warranty, it lasted 4 months, the second one I bought was a smaller one called Go Wise, so far so good, I love the black finish, it was much better than the gray finish the Cook's had. I decided to buy another but I wanted a bigger one to cook a whole chicken with. This air fryer is terrific to clean up, comes off so easy and it has a black finish. So, I tried today to cook the whole chicken but I shouldn't of rubbed it with olive oil, it smoked up my kitchen from the oil, next time I am going to just put spices on it, the chicken tasted great even though I smoked up the whole house. I love the warranty and the customer service I got when I called, they are happy to help you out. I would of given 5 starts but 4.5 because the fan is quite noisy, my husband has to raise the voice on the TV to hear it, sounds like an airplane. I have cooked many item in it so far and I highly recommend buying it even with the noise, you get used to it. I would buy this again if it broke, just love how the food comes out fast & crispy. The cook book is real nice too.

  If you like the idea of roasting a whole chicken with crispy skin on the top and bottom, this is the machine for you. I use this for almost everything frozen like eggrolls, burritos, chicken nuggets, and French fries. It's so easy and convenient to use, I have almost retired my microwave. The removable basket and basin are really easy to clean having a Teflon coating. There is a learning curve though. I first sprayed my whole thawed chicken with olive oil in order for the seasoning to stick. I soon learned you could fill a kitchen with smoke pretty easy if you don't take some precautions. Putting a little water in the basin and using an oil with a higher smoke point fixed the problem for me.  everything else goes straight from the freezer to the basket and out hot and crispy. I struggled with which air fryer to buy, so I'm glad a read the reviews on this item first. I have never written a review on a product until now, and I hope this helps.

  I was so excited to get this delivered the other day. I’ve been wanting an air fry for a while now and whenever I would start looking for one this is the one I kept coming back to. I finally decided to bight the bullet and just do it. We have such a crazy schedule in my house with my husbands crazy work schedule and a five year old picky eater. My son like most five year old loves chicken nuggets and French fries or tater tots. I really hate having to heat up my oven for 6 nuggets and a handful of fries so I was thinking this would be perfect And I was totally right. I’ve only made a few things in it but I can already tell I’m gonna love it. I made my son chicken and fries in about 10 minutes and I made some baked chicken cutlets in about 12 minutes. I loved that I didn’t have to heat up my whole kitchen by turning on my oven and I’m hoping it will help with my electric bill (everything in my house is electric) and the clean up was a breeze. Just some warm soapy water and a few swipes with a sponge and it was good to go. I did invest in the liners to put in the bottom of the basket just to be on the safe side

  This does a good job of making things crispy without burning them. I use this for frozen foods like chicken nuggets, french fries, beer battered cod, and batter covered chicken from TV dinners. The only thing I don't like about it is that you have to have the cooking basket in the machine for preheating. The one I had before this that I ended up returning because it was too small didn't force you to do that, it would heat up without the basket in it. The size of this one is about ideal for me.

Before buying my air fryer, I read several reviews that mentioned the air fryer would stop working halfway through the cooking. This issue has now started happening to me. I will be making food, and it turns off and on several times and then stops altogether. I've tried using different outlets in my kitchen to see if it is an electrical issue. That does not seem to be the problem.Before my air fryer stopped working, I liked using it a lot. It was easy to use and easy to clean. I made fries, mozzarella sticks, roasted veggies, and reheated pizza to get a crispy crust. It worked well in a lot of those instances. I am not sure if this is an issue isolated to a few air fryers, but it is frustrating now having a non-working air fryer just taking up space in my kitchen after spending more than $100. I can not recommend this air fryer after my experience.

  Ease of use. Safe for the counter top. I see where some people say it leaves puddles, mine does not, but I do not place the vented side close to a wall either.  I feel the presets are set alittle shy of getting food done, and I can not compare it  to any other.  I will still give 5 stars because the machine is a great addition to my place, and the food ither than a cake has turned out great.  I dont think you will be disappointed in your purchase

  I was skeptical first about it's capabilities. The first day it came, I just dropped in a bunch of wings and set it. Woohoo! In 15 minutes I was eating chicken wings at par with the ones I get at our local bars.Since then, I tried many things: carrots, veggies, potatoes, asparagus, fish, calamari, nests, etc. All turned out very tasty.Most of the times, I have to put no oil in meat. For veggies, a thin stay of oil suffices. This makes all the meals much healthier without losing the ""required oiliness"" of the food.Cleaning is also easy. The rack comes out, gets separated into the base pot and inner sieve and is dishwasher safe.Now, I just stick up things and don't have to plan elaborately. Just come home, decide what I want to eat, out it in the fryer and 15 mins later, ready to eat!

The cook chamber is roomy and square to provide maximum cooking capacity. It is also easy to insert and withdraw the basket. Cleanup is up not a problem with the non stick coating and the absence of protrusions into the cook chamber.I have used the Cosori at least once a day since I purchased it last month.

  Pros:It works great.The functions are easy to understand.It connects to wifi.It cleans really well/easily.Doesnt take up too much kitchen space.Cons:It stopped heating up after over 5 months of use.. not sure if it is the fuse that is causing the heat to not turn on, but all that circulates is cold air. Kind of disappointing but it was good while it lasted. Not sure if it was worth the $100+ when it breaks so easily tho.

  This fryer is absolutely the best!  Makes an entire crispy chicken, the best crunchies fries/potatoes, and what I call ""egg cupcakes"".  I bought one for my vacation home and one for each of my sons.  Only negative is you can't make the chicken and potatoes at the same time.  The recipe book is quite nice, although my first copy had the pages fall out.  I would not buy the accessory kit.  You are better off buying silicone baking cups.

The digital display is really nice, and you’ve got the option to choose your temperature and cook time manually, or with the preset buttons (there’s a bacon button, which cooked my bacon perfectly). My only gripe is that sometimes it seems as though the drawer has to be inserted/removed a few times before it actually shuts, but it might just need some breaking in since it’s new.

Chicken wings, fish, french fries, hot dogs, hamburgers all come out tasting great. Chicken parm is our favorite.  The only disappointment is when we cook steak. The steak cooks fine, tastes good, but has a gray coloring to it when done.  Just doesn't look very appetizing.  It might be the way we are cooking it, but other than that, it's a great fryer.

  I’ve had this air fryer for over six months and it’s only ok. It crisps up veggies and potatoes nicely, not salmon though. It’s very loud and feels extremely cheap for the price. I already noticed a screw is coming out that holds the basket to the handle. I did a lot of research before buying this and I’m slightly disappointed, I based my purchase off reviews. I was trying to upgrade :/ I had a Phillips air fryer before this that cost less and did just as good of a job.

  I absolutely love this air fryer, I can put a whole bag of French fries into this and it cooks them all and they are very crispy. I've cooked all types of stuff in this, the only thing I'm not crazy about is cooking fresh meat in it, my opinion it dries it out. But things like fries, onion rings, pizza bites, anything frozen it cooks amazing. I've made my own wraps in this with biscuits, flatten out biscuits and add meat, vegis, cheese pop it in cooker, amazing

  I needed to find a way to cook my favorite foods in a healthier process. I decided to go for it and ordered the Cosori based on reviews I had read.I LOVE it. My first attempt was “fried” chicken. It was the best I have ever had. The skin came out crispy and the meat was amazingly juicy.  The next best part was clean up. No oil to dump. Nothing sticking to the pan. The unit is lightweight so putting it in the pantry is easy.My grandkids love what I’ve made them... egg roll pizza roll ups & chicken fingers. I should also mention that I will be purchasing another one for my daughter so I don’t have to take mine with me to her house!I don’t put it in the dishwasher and I only use a Misto sprayer before putting food in the tray.

  It's pretty hard to learn to cook appropriately at the beginning. Once you learn you can master the art of cooking with this. The meats used to get either burnt or lose flavor when I first tried it. But as I continued to use I was finally able to cook meat perfectly while keeping it's flavor and spices. The key is flipping the meat once or twice at the right time during your entire duration. I once served chicken legs at a party, all of my guests really liked the way chicken was fried.

    Best Investment for Mom on the Go
  
",5.0,Adriana,"Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  After reading so many reviews about different air fryers, I decided to choose this one. By Far one of the Best investments I've made. I work full time and have 4 little ones always on the go and hardly have time to cook now. If you're trying to meal prep, buy this, if you get lazy and want something quick by this. It's so easy to use and super easy to clean. I have used it probably 6 times now. Nothing has broken off. You do need to be careful on that clear little plastic thing that you push to slide out the basket though. If you're not careful It looks like it can break. So don't get frustrated trying to open it. To sum it up I cooked chicken and asparagus in 8 mins. Lol

This is a perfect size for family of 3-5. Made fried chicken as the first experiment, it was delicious. It was perfectly crispy, juicy, not dry. This has preset buttons for meats, and the temperature and duration were perfect. Definitely recommend this.

I like that to fry basket is square and large. The settings are easy and convinient to use. Only down side is it is hard to clean off any stuck on food/oil. But I think that will be a challenge for any air fryer. Strongly recommend if you need a break from using the oven.

  My unit is slightly defective. Steam would release from the lower right corner causing water to drip causing a puddle to accumulate. Other drawback is that you must flip/rotate food in order to have even cooking. Washing is a bit difficult because the upper try has too many ridges to properly clean.

  What I liked:Great air fryer for air frying lots of food at once. It does a good job crisping  food if you have some experience with the process. For example, to best crisp wings and not have any burning, its important to first cook them in the oven and finishing to crisp them in the air fryer.What I don't like:We've had the Cosori Air Fryer since mid-June ( 4 months) and the fryer basket that pulls out broke in End of October. It looks like the basket just cracked due to head damage. Now I'm trying to figure out how to reach Amazon to get a replacement basket (assuming they will make this process easy for me). I'm not sure if anyone else has had this issue but we are regular users of our air fryer. Since we bought it, we have probably used it twice a week (sometimes more).

Not super quiet, sounded like it was powering up to take off, but IT IS AMAZING. Id buy again in heartbeat. Ive only used twice so hopefully it lasts a long time. Perfect for 2 people.

  Love this fryer, great size for a family of 4!  Basket is easy to clean, but now that I’ve been using it for 6 months I’ve learned it’s important to clean the area of the fryer unit that’s left open when you remove the basket - I never read any of that in the maintenance facts.  So. Be sure to clean that area of your fryer - I’m working to get off some build up today.Only reason I didn’t give a full 5 star rating is because sometimes the touch screen on the unit does not respond to my touch.  When that happens, I just get on my phone and use the WiFi feature to get my unit going.  Love the WiFi feature, it even lets me know when my family is using the unit  when I’m away from home!

  For the price range, this has been the best buy during the Black Friday sale. For someone who is too lazy to cook, this has been a perfect equipment to ease that stress of cooking everyday. I love how easy it is to use with its multiple cooking presets for a variety of foods, and with the recipe book of a hundred food recipes, you will be set for quite some time. It is very easy to clean as well, only need to careful not to use any metal so as not to ruin the non-stick coating. The size is large and the price is very reasonable as well.

  I've had the air fryer for about a month now and with one exception have been very happy with the purchase. It's a nice improvement over the T-Fal air fryer I had been using. The feature that I like most over the T-fal is the 2 piece square basket design over the T-Fal's single piece round basket. Ironically the basket is also my single disappointment with the product. I cooked up some frozen chicken the other day and was surprised when I found a screw and washer in with my food. On examining the basket I found that one of the screws that hold the handle in place was missing and the other two were very loose. A simple fix to tighten them back up again but a bit disappointing all the same.

  This air fryer works great.  Anything I've cooked in it has come out outstanding.  Any type of chicken I've cooked has been amazing!  Chicken breasts are very tender and there's no need to cut into thin slices.  Thighs and drumsticks are better than a restaurant and the best part...no deep frying in oil!  Just a little dab of olive oil spray and that's all it takes for a great crunch!  My salmon has come out delicious.  It may take less time than it calls for in the cook book.  I pretty much set my own temperatures and time limit.  The only thing I can say that I disliked about it was it smelled a little like plastic for the first couple of uses but went away thereafter.  I like the fact that it is PFOA-free & BPA-free and the size is perfect for my counter space.  I've seen some of the comments with a less rating but I have not had any issues with it.  It has worked pretty good for me.  I would recommend this product.

  I LOVE my air fryer. It’s so sleek and looks good on my counter. My food comes out perfect with the settings for the most part. Sometimes I have to do some adjusting but once I tweak it to the right temperature and time, so yummmmmy! And it’s such a healthier option than frying. I use about a tsp-tbsp of oil, depending on what I’m cooking. One of my best buy’s to date!

  I purchased this item because I lost my spouse and did not want to spend a lot of time preparing meals and cleaning up afterwards. The ease of use and time to prepare meals is easy and the clean up afterwards is great. I used to eat a lot of grilled foods on a vented cook top so the flavor is not quite the same, however the health benefits are great as I have lost weight from eliminating the fats, and butters. I am still experimenting with new items and times with good results. Start at a known temp for an item and play with times, I start with short times and work up from there until I determine my desired level of being done. Works great for frozen meats in case you forgot to take them out of the freezer.

  First:  Would not have purchased this product had I known more about it.  Seems to overcook items such as chicken wings and vegetables if you go by the presets or recommended settings. Second, there isn't a feasible way to determine if raw items such as chicken or fish will be actually cooked through.  In an oven, you can bake a chicken for 1 1/2 hours and you know it will be cooked through.  Also we tried to call  Cosori company well into their posted hours and were advised the company was closed.  We left a message and it took them a week to respond. Also, the digital touch screen is very temperamental.  Touching directly, didn't really turn it on.  I had to almost wave my finger gently across the blue light for it to respond.  It took several attempts to turn the unit on.

  Did some research and Cosori came out on top in large part because of capacity (5.8 qt), square shaped basket, ease of clean up (only two pieces involved go straight into dishwasher), and there were a lot of youtube reviews. Two year warranty. Company really stands behind its product. Amazon had the best price. Sometimes they have coupons you can attach to it.

  It’s very easy to use, and the oil used to cook is much less than the traditional fried food, the cooking time is also reduced a lot, food flavor is good too, we tried chicken, fish and tofu, love it. Forgot to mention one thing, it won’t generate the deep fried food’s heavy smell.

",5.0,Lora A Lindsey,"Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is a great addition for the kitchen.  The only negative is that with a family of 4, I sometimes have to do multiple batches while keeping cooked food warm.  This is perfect for a family of 1-3 people.  My favorite part is I can get my frozen french fries crispy without the oil and quicker than in the oven or fryer.  It does take some trial and error on cooking times and temp.  Until you know for sure, it is best to stay close and keep opening and checking and depending on what you are cooking, shaking.  Highly recommend this product.

  I am a personal trainer got this on 2/14/19 and use it regularly to cook nutritious meals.  I loved it initially and today the handle fell right off.  It looks like the heat melted away the plastic.  I was raving about it to everyone & told of my clients to buy one.  Today however, as I was actually showing and demonstrating to clients how I use it to cook healthy options and it literally fell apart as I picked it up to show them how easy it was to clean it.

  This is my first air fryer.  Once you get one you won't go back!  Cuts cooking time by 50% to 75% compared to oven, grill, or stove and cooks very consistently.  To give you an idea on what you can do, I cooked five frozen biscuits in less than 10 minutes with no preheat to a perfect golden brown, straight out of the freezer.  My convection over can't even do as well.  This fryer is working spectacularly.  Definitely a recommend.  Just keep in mind, you will need to drop your temperatures on almost everything you cook because this provides a very concentrated heat.  It takes a bit but it's easy to figure out temps and times in order to achieve perfection.

  This provides more even and crispier cooking than the Phillips at a much higher price. It is very quiet when running. Cleaning is a complete snap. The outside stays cool and even the exhaust isn't all that warm. Temperatures seem accurate. The slight rubbery smell went completely away after we ran it empty a few times at 450. Adjusting time and temperature are easy once you get used to the order of pushing the buttons. One thing we don't mind but worth mentioning is that the three screws that hold the handle onto the basket loosen and need tightening about once a month. If they get too loose the drawer gets difficult to insert. If yours gets difficult to latch, check this as the likely cause. Other than that, reliability is great - we've used it most days for going on six months, no problems.

  I purchased this air fryer in April 2020 and almost immediately started experiencing a ""flying basket"" during cooking.  I continue to deal with it until now after only 3 months after purchase, the basket won't even latch shut completely.  This is unacceptable on a $100 appliance.  Now the return window is closed on Amazon.  I am currently reaching out to the manufacturer to see if they will accept a return.  I will be looking for another brand air fryer.

  This product was defective right out of the box. As soon as the unit was powered up and connected to wifi, a firmware upgrade occurred. When I went to use the unit for the first time, some of the preset buttons would not work and the time/temp button was non-functional. I was able to use the VeSync app to control the unit but every time the unit completed cooking and shut off, the wifi connection would disconnect.

I’m not sure why others had puddles or what not , because I’ve never experienced any problems. I would recommend using something under it while cooking though. I use a chopping block.

  Had this product for almost two years. It was great. Like other reviews the handle is starting to be loose but hasn’t come off for me. However, now I turn it on and after a minute it shuts off automatically. So it is of no use. Doesn’t work anymore. And it’s been almost two years so out of warranty. Pretty poor appliance if it can’t even last two years. Don’t buy if you want it to last long.

  This is a tiny convection oven that takes up a lot of space. The word fryer in the description is misleading. There is no frying. Another problem Is it takes enough time to cook barely enough of one thing to serve 2 people that if you wanted to cook more than one item or for more than 1 or 2 people, you’ll be cooking for hours. Just use your oven or toaster oven. It’s not worth the investment.

And buttermilk fried chicken thighs. Also, amazing!  Three observations...the basket is on the small side. I could fit four good sized chicken thighs. Had to do the other two after. The chicken stick to the bottom. Google suggested that I put parchment paper in the bottom I did not do that and I will try it next time. Last thing, I don’t really like the smell but I get over it.

  Just wasn't what I expected. I was looking for something to give me that fried food taste as they all claim. It wasn't even close. It did a decent job with chicken but not that fried taste.

  I have loved trying things in the Fryer - only a few things - one is you have to do things in batches to really get them done right.  Things are not as crispy as you might want if truly fried (I could be doing something wrong but follow recipes to the T). Wish there were 2 sides so you could cook chicken and a veggie at same time.Easy to cleanThe way the basket goes into the Fryer is a little iffy - it doesn't always feel secure. Like not the best made but we still get a lot of use out of it.

  This is an amazing air fryer! It comes with several heating options for different types of cooking preferences. The preheating option is amazing as well, just set the temperature you want it and it auto-adjusts the time (400 degrees takes 5 mins, 360 takes 4 mins). Very easy to clean as well, there are only 2 parts you have to clean the basket and the part you have to take out. Put aluminum foil in the bottom to save on clean up time. I would def recommend the 5.8 Quarts size. When you're cooking a big dish the bigger size can turn 2 batches into one. If you're cooking for a group of people you can't have half of them wait 20 mins while the other half is already eating.

  I used to have a 1.2 qt air fryer (gave it to my parents) and wanted something bigger. I read reviews and debating on this and the Ninja Air Max XL and decided on this one and I’m so glad I did. I love the Cosori air fryer. It’s so easy to use and clean. It’s not very noisy (didn’t matter to me) and I love the square basket instead of a round basket. You will not be disappointed.

    Beware of the WiFi version
  
",1.0,Randall M,"Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purchased the WiFi version and it worked for the first 2-3 times just fine, but then it suddenly wouldn't connect to my WiFi any longer, and none of the other buttons would work or even light up besides the power button. I tried all the troubleshooting techniques suggested, but to no avail. I'm hopeful the manufacturer will respond to my request I made through their website. I will update this rating if so. Not too sure about the non-WiFi version, but beware of this one for sure. I've seen other similar issues reported. I just wish I would have read them first.

When I saw this one, I felt like the larger size and shape of the basket was perfect for my family.  I have not been disappointed!  We especially love making hot wings in it.

  In this era of new gadgets and gizmos, this item really has been a game-changer for our kitchen. Gone are the days of waiting long periods of time to warm meats and other frozen items in the oven, or risk turning them to rubber in the microwave. It's the counterpart to our Instant Pot... maybe should have been called the Instant Oven. This item simply does a great job cooking meat, kale chips, veggies, etc... in a very short amount of time.Clean-up is easy.The only thing that seems awkward is the clamp that attaches the frying cage to the drip pan.

I’ve used it for  Italian sausage, chicken, grilled cheese, shrimp, garlic bread, and biscuits.  AEverything has come out great.  I was in a hurry to learn it since I was taking it to use in a hotel room for several weeks.  I used to think I didn’t need one more gadget in my kitchen, but the air fryer was so fun to use. Cleanup is very easy.  I think I will purchase the parchment paper recommended from others. That would have helped with my biscuits.

  Cleans up easily even if I forget to clean it for a couple days.  Most of the cooking settings I have tried have worked perfectly, but when I have needed to adjust the temp or timer, it’s super easy.  No need to wait for the oven to preheat.  My kitchen is small with little storage and I didn’t want this “eye sore” on my counter but I don’t even think it looks bad!  I shouldn’t have hesitated so long.

  Amazing! Best small kitchen appliance I’ve ever bought. It is a little big sitting on the countertop but it doesn’t bother me. I use it so often that I can’t put it away as I would be getting it out all the time. I use it for everything- quick appetizers when my kids are “starving” before dinner is ready, frozen foods, and even a small whole chicken. Frees up my oven for other things as well. Cleans up in minutes!

  Everything I’ve made has been very easy and very good. I would recommend buying it with a small bread pan or something. The basket is good but you can really do a lot more with it when properly accessorized. Also, before buying make sure you have space for it. It doesn’t fit in any of my cabinets so it’s going to have to stay permanently on my counter

  It took me a while to decide which air fryer to get, but decided on the Cosori after thorough research. I was not disappointed! The Cosori air fryer is amazing, I've been using it almost every day since I've gotten it. There's a ton of presets, but you can also put your own settings (manual). It's super easy to clean both the basket and the tray. I usually put aluminum foil under the holed tray to catch any additional drippings or seasonings for easy clean up. Overall, would definitely recommend this brand!

  Air fryers are great for reproducing deep fryer results without all the oil.  This wasn't the case for me with the Cosori air fryer.  Pre-packaged foods came out dehydrated instead of ""fried"".  Fresh potato fries came out limp with burnt edges.  In addition, both varieties were left with a slight chemical taste from the Teflon material used in the air fryer.  My previous air fryer did not have these issues.  I'm not sure if the flavor of other foods would be affected because I'm not willing to try at this point.  I didn't buy an air fryer to cook steak.

  Nice size to cook food within it. No oil needed maybe some pan spray to get the same color as you would fry in oil. But made some pork chops in there took just about an hour and some change to make 12 and let me tell you worth the wait. The pork chops had the crunch as it was fried but the nice juicy textures as if you were to bake and I fell in love with this air fryer. Take my word for it, it can be kind of tricky at first honestly but it is worth the buy.

  I made breaded cauliflower and breaded eggplant slices, crispy and no oil involved. I also made a 2 inch thick bone in pork chop, 18 minutes, flipped it at 9 minutes, very moist. It comes with a recipe booklet but I just google air fryer recipes. The clean up is very easy, just soapy warm water and a sponge.

  I absolutely loved this air fryer! It has a large basket so I was able to make food for my whole family at the same time. However, it suddenly quit working on me last night in the middle of making dinner. I’ve had it less than a year. Up until the last few months I was only using it (at most) once a week, sometimes every other week or two. These past three months we’ve used it about 2 times per week. What a bummer!

  Used our air fryer for the second time tonight. The first we didn’t make the chicken moist enough so it came out dry but the second time we used the recipe that is in the recipe book that comes with the product and it was DELICIOUS!! We’ve only had it 2 days so I don’t know about durability but it’s easy to use, flavors retain well and it makes unhealthy things a bit healthier. The only con is it’s hard to clean but I think that’s true of any other air fryer. I would still rather clean the air fryer than worry about disposing off giant amounts of oil after use.

  Had my eye on this for a while now, and decided to pick it up during prime day.It's wonderful: it is easy to clean, cooks food quickly, comes with a full-color cookbook, and 12-month extension on your warranty. If you are thinking about getting an air-fryer, I would highly recommend this model.The only non-positive thing I have to say about this appliance is that you have to be mindful of where you place this in your kitchen. There is a steam vent located in the back, which can billow out quite a high volume if you are cooking food with too much oil or moisture in it. However, this will only occur if you go above the very clearly stated tolerances of this device - as was the case in my one and only experience with such.

  Finally followed all the rage and got an air fryer. A friend had this one so I went with it. It’s easy to use, makes delicious food, and cleaning it hasn’t been tough at all. My only complaint is it came in the original box which had been retaped - I assume it is used and didn’t come with the cook book that should have been inside the box. Other than that, I love it.

   I used the air fryer about 5 times when all of a sudden, smoke starts coming out while in pre-heat mode. I made sure I cleaned the basket thoroughly, tried again, and still smoke comes out while trying to pre-heat. I didn't attempt to cook anything as I don't want to start potential fire. I contacted support and since the 1 year warranty is over the agent was not able to help or replace my item. I'm really disappointed as I enjoyed using the air fryer.

  So far this air fryer has exceeded expectations. I was a little apprehensive seeing a few reviewers mentioning problems they had, however, I experienced none of these. Its presets work very well, but it is also a huge bonus to be able to set the time and temperature. The design makes it simple to use and easy to clean. I think that the only thing I can complain about is that I wish the max temperature would be just a little bit higher.

  Perfect for cooking for my small family. Not only does it cook in a much shorter time frame than the oven, it gives a good char on the outside and inside is still moist. The only thing I don’t like is the smell the machine has while it’s on, I’m not sure how to describe it - it’s like having the new car smell but not as pleasant. I’m sure in time it’ll go away but overall, I still love this machine. It does the job well.

  So far the Cosori air fryer has worked perfectly.  We used it continuously for the first week and now once or twice a week.  Used for cooking chicken wings, breasts and tenders, bacon, eggplant, fries and a few more that I can't remember.  The best part is cleaning.  Soak it in some soap and water followed with a sponge and all done, no scrubbing.  The wire rack sometimes needs a scouring sponge but not bad.Recommend as a quick easy way to cook.

I wouldn’t invest in the WiFi model, only because I stood near it the entire time while it cooked and didn’t need to check my phone. The WiFi and app does work though! I would say , buy it.

  Works well, I've used my Cosori most every day since I purchased.  Food comes out great, saves me time in cleanup. Cleaning is generally easy but with splatter that occurs around the heating element that area is difficult at best to clean.  I don't think this is individually a problem with Cosori but air fryers of this type build in general.  Maybe in the next generation but I knew this going into the purchase.  Very good product, glad I purchased.

  I love fried foods and was skeptical about ""air"" fryers. But I gotta say, ater making fried chicken, french fries and more, I am thoroughly impressed with the Cosori. Two minor issues - the first few times it stinks up the kitchen as it burns off production oils - I suggest running it a few cycles OUTSIDE before using, though it does not affect the flavor of the food. Also, it would be good if there were a more thorough guide for general cooking of foods not provided in the cookbook. However, all is fine, and their customer service was great when I had questions.

  I was not sure if I would like an Air Fryer or use it much but I LOVE IT! It was hard to understand all the buttons and there are a few quirks to learn but the food tasted amazing, juicy and not dried out. The clean up is super easy, I put aluminum foil under the basket and its super easy clean up. The basket is large enough for a family of 2, and because the cook time is cut in half of a conventional oven you could prepare a meal for 4 in 2 batches. I tried to cook the French fries recipe and it came out overcooked because I cut them thin I think the recommended size was 1/2"" thick. Overall I'm enjoying the fryer and thinking of different kind of foods to try.

  This air fryer is pretty good.  The basket is huge and super easy to clean.  The Wifi setup was simple and this fryer works great with the app, it even reminds you to shake what you are cooking, half way through.  However... (and the only reason that I’m giving it 4 out of 5) the front display buttons do not function properly and are 98% unresponsive.  I wind up using the Wifi/app which is far easier anyways.

  The fryer works really well from a cooking stand point.  But, from day one of having the thing, the fryer basket is a challenge.  For some reason, it almost always wants to pop out while cooking.

Really annoying and, quite frankly, unsatisfactory.  I would not recommend this product.

  This air fryer cooks hamburgers, breaded chicken, and pork roasts beautifully. We cut the pork roast into 2“x 2“ cubes and the air fryer gave it a charbroiled flavor as if we had grilled it outside.  It did so in much quicker time than in the conventional oven without heating the whole kitchen up.It also reheats leftovers beautifully. Makes leftover chicken fingers, french fries or egg rolls nice and crispy again in just a few minutes without preheating.

  Intended to use this occasionally and keep it in the basement. It is large but found room for it in the kitchen because we use it so frequently. It cooks frozen fried foods to perfection but we use it mostly for reheating leftovers that should be crisp - tortilla chips, bagels that taste like they were just baked, grilled cheese sandwiches, hors d'oeuvres We even reheated lasagna in it!

  I’ve got to say-this was a good investment and change from a deep fryer. My only complaint is the design of the basket. The basket has MANY vents which is great to hear food but sometimes food gets into these cracks and are really hard to get out since you can’t deep clean/scrub since it’s in such a tight space, personally I believe this is a design flaw but other than that it is SUPER EASY to use!

  Pros. This was our first air fryer and when you get it to cook, the food comes out great.Cons. The touchscreen is SUPER finicky, usually won't pick up my finger and we have to use the app on our phone to set it. We bought it 2 months ago and used it almost every day, but today it stopped working, it no longer senses when the tray is in and therefore is unusable, because it will not start. Cleaning the outer bin can become an aggravating affair if food gets into the airflow channels. I had to disassemble it once to clean it.

I have cooked glazed carrots, breaded chicken breast, pork chops, tator tots and  avocado fries. I have also used it to reheat leftovers, such as pizza, stuffed mushrooms and eggplant Parmesan.

I was so appreciative of their customer service. Would definitely buy another air fryer from Cosori.  I can’t believe all the wonderful dishes we have made while keeping it healthy!  Crab cakes were especially great!

  While I like the results, there is a lot of effort in using this. There is also one more appliance to take up space in a cabinet or something else sitting on the counter. It is worth it if you will use it frequently but I just don’t know that I personally would enough.

  This air fryer is great, but it makes a very loud rattling noise when using. It is odd because the rattling noise doesn't occur the entire time while cooking, but it is very loud (you can hear it from another room). I am currently waiting on product support to get back to me. I was very disappointed after spending this much on an air fryer and I didn't expect to have a problem on the first use. I will likely return if support cannot help me. Overall, the air fryer works great if you can stand not being able to hear the TV when using it.

  Only had it for a couple of weeks.  Makes pretty good French fries. Reheating pizza great, nice crisp bottom crust. Fish, hamburgers ok. Use fewer minutes than recommended or burger is too well done. We’re still experimenting, but so far, so good. Easy to use  but we aren’t using the WiFi app.  When you’re sheltering in place, I sure donate need that option!😀

  I have nothing negative to say about this air fryer.  It is absolutely the best thing I've ever bought for my kitchen.  We have used it everyday since it has arrived.  Of course it's perfect for my daughters frozen breaded items (Mozz sticks, French fries, fish sticks and her beloved tator tots).  However, I've cooked veggies, chicken (wings and breast), brussel sprouts.  You name it, I've cooked it in the air fryer.  This is GOLD at my house.  The capacity is just perfect..big enough to feed my family.

  Wow - almost as fast as a microwave but doesn't destroy food.  10 mins give or take to roast and brown, most anything you want!!

    Basket Issues
  
",2.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States September 3, 2019","









  
  
    
  This air fryer cooks pretty well and I have no complaints about the food I’ve made in it, but when I remove the basket it separates from the cooking basket.  Every time I pull the basket out of the air fryer It detaches from the second basket without me having to push the button and that’s a problem because he keeps dropping on the counter and once I burnt myself to keep it from dropping on the floor with my food in it.  If I could send it back I would I think this one must be defective.

  Love how food comes out crispy when using this air fryer!  And it is room enough to feed my family of four (but not roomy enough to feed a large crowd).  The only thing I do not like about this product is that the bottom of the food basket insert is easy to clean, but not the sides!  The way that the vents are facing on all four sides of the food basket, it is difficult to get in each vent to clean off the grease and food.  Besides that, I love it and use it almost every day.

We’ve had a few other air fryer’s over the years that were amazing… Stay away if you don’t want to screw in your food

  I used this today for the first time.  Made chicken wings.  They were very yummy, but the most important thing, for me, was the ease of clean up.  I had purchased, and used, a different brand, and returned it because it was a nightmare to clean up.  The basket was very difficult to remove and the grill was a removable wire piece of junk.  This fryer was so much better!  The basket came out very easily, and the grill is a coated piece that is part of the basket, not removable.  Loved it.  Would definitely recommend

  Overall cooking performance wise, very good air fryer. It's easy to use and clean. My only concern was that the fryer had a plastic smell when being used. I even sent one in for a replacement and the new one still has a plastic smell when cooking foods. The second fryer had the same issue of having the plastic smell but just a little less. I suggest do some research before buying any air fryer in general.

If you push ""French fries"", for example, the system would not let me change the temp or time. None of the buttons actually worked, even if I could push them.

  I knew the air fryer would be great for quick food with less grease, however what exceeded my expectations with this air fryer is I had a power surge and then I flipped the breaker back on the air fryer had saved the time left and setting for my food. It saved me from over cooking or under cooking. Well worth it.

You have to remember to clean above burner after it has cooled . I use mine on rangetop with ventilation fan. To cut down on any heat build up in kitchen.

  So far, it has worked well, and we've had great results, food wise. The one really frustrating quirk about it enters in if you're cooking multiple batches of the same thing (IE: egg rolls). Every time you open the drawer, it shuts off and erases your cooking time/temperature settings. Not a deal breaker, necessarily. But it can definitely be frustrating.

  Received my Cosari air fryer yesterday. It was packaged well and easy to set up. We quickly skimmed over the manual but this unit is very easy to use. The basket does tend to stick a little but we are not bothered by that. We made sausage patties this morning and it took 7 minutes per side. No grease spattered stove to clean! I’m very happy with this purchase and it has an 18 month warranty on it. You’ll hear people complain about a plastic smell when they use it. We did notice it slightly but it wasn’t anything major. My husband is like a kid at Christmas. He can’t wait to do chicken wings.

Special recommendation for the support team at Cosori who helped me get a replacement copy of recipe book when my original book was destroyed. All in all great experience. I will recommend this airfryer to all.

  Overall, i think this unit would be great. However, i think we have an issue with the buttons. We need to press them like 25 times to try to get them to work. This is mainly for the temp controlling buttons. The preset buttons are ok, but the up and down temp or timer, rarely work. It is incredibly frustrating. Anyone else having this issue?

  Great when it works, but as I've seen in multiple other reviews, has a ton of electrical problems. Shuts off halfway through pre heating, and if you can get it to pre heat it'll shut off halfway through cooking. Tried multiple outlets, unplugged everything else on the electrical circuit to make sure there wasn't too much power, nothing works. Don't waste your money.

    Basket shoots out during cooking

  Very strange, a few times the basket shoots out after preheat. Tonight 3 minutes into preheat the basket shot out and landed on the floor breaking the part that clicks into the frame. Too hot to pick up off wood floor. That was crazy. I think this is a defect because my children have the same one and they’ve never experienced this. I will return it and exchange for a new one.

  I love this Air Fryer! It is a must have in every kitchen! The  only reason I gave it a 4 star is because the basket had a deeper scratch on the outside when it arrived. I am hoping overtime it does not corrode.

  Absolutely love this air fryer and it's my most used kitchen gadget. I've cooked meat in it, heated up frozen food and even just heated up left overs. The only minor thing I dislike is the side grills are a little hard to keep clean. This would happen with any air fryer though. LOVE IT AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

  I like the performance of this air fryer. There's a major problem with it though. The door may appear closed but it won't be completely closed. One of two things will happen. 1 it will stop cooking. 2 the pressure from the air pushes it out and if it's on a counter it will push your food on the floor.

  I love it. it is easy to use . Cooked bacon in it for the first time yesterday everybody asked how I cooked it so crisp. It's so easy to clean unless there is cheese or a lot of fat (bacon ) I most generally just wipe it out. I use very little oil when cooking with it. The shake timer and the size is why I bought it.
