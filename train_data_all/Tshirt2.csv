  Fits wells good material a little worse for wear in that I work in a more heavy duty environment and the everyday riff raff has torn a small hole in the abdomen area like my other shirts, which is why I ordered these,  in much less time. These would be good shirts for everyday wear as opposed to heavier environments like sports and work. They're cheap, fit well and are made of a nice material. I'd buy them again for sure.

  Perfect undershirts for the money! If you're like me, I ALWAYS wear an undershirt. It's just more comfortable that way. I wanted to replace my large aging collection with some new crisp white tshirts.  Being able to buy 10 at a time (I bought a total of 20) to replace them all sure made my wife happy! They fit well... I did buy XXL so with a little shirking in the dryer, they're a perfect XL fit. The quality and construction is on par with Hanes or any others I've had before.  They seem thick enough to even wear on their own too.

  I ordered this pack of shirts for my boyfriend as a Christmas present. He loved the quality and the basic colors but the shirts ended up being a little smaller than expected so I had to return and order a larger size. I would recommend ordering a size larger than normal but other than that they are wonderful quality and are amazing everyday basic options.

  I saw a good deal on a 5-pack of these shirts so I went ahead and pulled the trigger. I prefer men's cut shirts because they normally cover everything I like covered and was hoping these would still do that for me although I couldn't try them beforehand.. I've worn two of the shirts so far and they are excellent quality. They don't feel scratchy at all straight out of the pack. They do definitely cover what I need them to and they are in a color scheme I prefer to wear (dark colors). They would have fit perfectly had I not gained some extra weight during this quarantine period, but aside from that these shirts meet all expectations.

    Inconsistent stitching & too wide sleeves, but a great price
  
",3.0,D. Kamins,"Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2021","









  
  
    
  Hard to complain about shirts this cheap. They get the job done. Colors are as represented, dark/saturated with no bleeding in wash.However a few issues: 1) The stitching is not great. One of the five has a few areas of stitching hanging loose and incomplete. The rest seemed fine.  2) The sleeves are way too wide (for my taste I suppose), a bit short and almost flared out ... If you are under 6' and can do a 100 lb bicep curl with each arm, then the Medium probably will fit nicely.As an undershirt, it's a solid buy. Just donate the one or two with bad stitching, and don't worry about the aesthetics. If you want to wear it on its own, I would probably look elsewhere.

  Golden work shirts are typically a better fit. For whatever reason the sleeves on these were a little shorter than usual. Maybe it’s how I washed them. Overall good fit. I prefer a little looser fit but these worked out well. I’m not a fan of the super fitted so this is the perfect compromise. For size reference I’m short 5’8 and about 215lbs. Muscular build.

    Shrinks
  
",3.0,J.D.,"Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2019","









  
  
    
  I'm 5'9"" 165 lbs and wear a medium. My biggest issue with undershirts from Hanes and Fruit of the Loom is they have a collar you could drive a truck through. Me personally I like a tighter fitting collar and the Gildan's are better than others I've tried. However, as with other similar undershirts, these shrink a lot and now some of them do not stay tucked in. The quality is on par with Hanes and Fruit of the Loom and other undershirts I've tried but at least it somewhat solves my collar issue.

  For the price, these are an excellent value purchase. They are exactly as described and depicted in the product details. Some may argue that they are thin, but they offer a heavier weight t-shirt. These are fine as undershirts.In fact, I've seen this brand at the local art/craft store, on sale for $4/each. Periodically, these go on for sale at a discounted price, which makes them a very worthwhile purchase.I wear them, and some I paint with fabric or acrylic paint. During the summer, they more than suffice as outerwear. And with painted designs, a custom made masterpiece. hehe.

I hate to complain and honestly very rarely leave reviews but I was fairly excited to gets these since they claim to be soft and comfortable and I needed some under shirts for work but these are kind of stiff and not very soft. I gave a 2 star because the price was decent and I should know in most cases you get what you pay for but I am debating returning. Sorry for the rant if anybody even makes it to the end.

  I’m not sure when plain white t’s became so expensive but they are a bit over priced at places like Target, Kohl’s etc.  These shirts were a better value to me and had good reviews.  I am familiar with this brand since I used to own a screen printing business.  They have quality products which made my decision a little easier.  Initially when I opened the package I thought these shirts were going to be too heavy as an undershirt so I was a little disappointed. But, once I washed them they softened up so I decided to wear one as a test.  I am now completely satisfied with these shirts and will likely buy another pack.

  I'm highly impressed. The shirts are well-made. They're durable and, if any discrepancy in size, they fit maybe just slightly large and noticeably long, and that's preferable, in my opinion, to being just a little too small. I like getting more for my hard-earned money and Gildan undershirts seem, to me, an absolute no-brainer of a high-value bargain. The value is really just that impressive. Great product and great value - thanx!

  First off I want to say that the first pack I ordered are absolutely amazing! The gray and black pack is a great thick but thin and soft but stretchy material, 5 stars for sure. I ordered the second pack of these shirts because my husband loved the first pack (Gray and Black). The second pack I bought, the pack with the blue, red, and gray shirts are way worse quality. The first 3 shirts that I opened out of this pack were fine...... although a slightly different material than the other colored pack I bought (the material of the other pack was awesome), they still seemed to be decentish quality. The last two shirts that came in the pack look like the machine that sewed them screwed up, there is stitching out of place everywhere with long strands hanging off and stiching crossing from the front to back. I wouldn't purchase the specific pack I got this time again.

I use this for around the house or going out, I don't care to dress up and am more oriented around comfort in wearing what I do while going out or lounging around the house.That said, the only ding I give this product is the tight neck. It's not choking tight, but it is the tightest part of the shirt. Other like-shirts have more neck room. I don't mind this too much and the above pros beats this, to me at least.

    Cotton - Expect Shrinkage - Would Prefer They Were Longer To Compensate
  
",4.0,Mark2012,"Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2019","









  
  
    
  Always expect some shrinkage with cotton and especially in the length of the torso and sleeves. I want Large, so I order XL in cotton - standard protocol. However, the fit would be much better for me (and for most men, I would think) if they made them longer, so that when they shrink (and they always do), they would not end up with that boxy square shape. And they would be long enough to tuck in when I want (gasp). Sure, nobody wants them too long, but with the inevitable shrinking, that's not going to be a problem. Just a couple more inches is all (insert Michael Scott line here).

  These Ts are really comfortable, fit me well, and after several washes have a stable shape with nice even slight shrinkage after med-high heat drying - just what I was looking for. Most L Ts are too big and most M Ts are too small for my med-slight frame. The length of these is perfect for me too - below the belt line by a few inches but not below my crotch like a miniskirt! Stays nicely tucked.I liked these so much I bought a pack of V-necks - again, perfect. I like these better than my last batches of Hanes and FotL and hope they’ll be as durable as those brands.

  Genius design. It has two short sleeves that partially cover your arms, and a large hole for your head to poke through so the shirt doesn't obscure your view. If you put your arms through the head hole or your head through the arm holes, it doesn't work as well, but when worn as intended it works as advertised. It's great for covering my torso in warmer weather and in a pinch it can be folded and tied to look like a ninja mask.They're t-shirts, folks. That's all.

  So, a few things to keep in mind when buying shirts. Whether you're going to buy them to wear on the outside/as a stand alone shirt OR your buying to wear under a uniform (i.e. security, law enforcement, firefighter, etc.).If you're using them as a stand alone shirt, you can get whatever size you normally wear and it should fit you fine.If you need them to wear under your uniform, get a size smaller and it won't be so small that it won't fit.  It'll just be snug enough so it doesn't bunch up under your uniform blouse once it's tucked in.The quality seems great! Solid shirt and you can tell they used good quality material.

  Due to some negative reviews about the quality of this Gildan tee shirt and the short length, I was hesitant to make this purchase.  I made it based upon the quality of past Gildan products.  The length was better than expected. I am 5 ' 9"" with a longer torso and I found plenty of material at the bottom of the tee shirt to tuck in.  There were negative reviews about the shrinkage.  After washing these tee shirts and putting through a normal dryer cycle, I did not find shrinkage to be a problem.  The one key element of the is tee shirt is that the collar lays flat.  This allows for a good look under a work shirt. I am pleased with how the collar lays.  It looks good.  I would buy these again  And I plan to buy more Gildan products based upon my experiences with Gildan clothing items.

  For the price these t-shirts are a pretty decent product.  I bought some Hanes t-shirts at the same time and I would rate them better for comfort.  Slightly thicker without being uncomfortable under a shirt or sweater.They are quite well made but on 4 of the 5 the seam under the sleeve was not finished very well.  As it was only on the inside I am not too concerned. However, the fifth shirt the seam actually finished on the outside as a 2"" tag.  More funny than anything but QA could probably be tightened.Oddly, one of the five has more polyester and is described as 'moisture wicking'.  It is actually a nice t-shirt but I think I would have been happy with all cotton.I would buy again.

  This was the first time I bought a Gildan product.The product was delivered before the given delivery date (a plus).

When I removed from the dryer to fold they looked significantly smaller so I tried one on. They don't fit anymore! They shrunk so much they are not long enough to tuck in my pants and are very tight around the armpit stitch. Unwearable! Please be forewarned: if you buy this product make sure you order at one or two sizes larger. I would recommend going with Hanes, Fruit or another brand.

My neck is a 16-16 1/2. Just isn’t like other gildan shirts I have.

  The black shirts that I purchased fit really well.  They have a longer length, which is great when you have to bend down.  No one needs to see a full moon, a half moon, or even a crack of the moon.I'm sure the white shirts would fit just as well.* Update: The white shirts, that I also purchased, fit perfectly with the same length as the black shirts.Stay safe! ✌

  Few items to note here. First the cost of these shirts are super cheap so I expected them to not be the greatest quality or to last a super long time either. Figured I would buy these for an upcoming vacation and if they lasted after that, it would be a bonus. Two of the four shirts were not even stitched at the sleeve and one had some threads that if pulled would pull apart the collar stitches. There is a difference being of cheaper quality and not even assembling your product properly to sell. With only one good shirt in the bunch, the deal for 15.00 for four shirts really is 15 for one wearable shirt. Beware as you will get what you pay for here.

  I like this company. Great price for good quality, relatively thick compared to other brands,100% cotton shirts. These work as undershirts or for going out. Recently I've gained weight because I been stuck inside and had to go up a size so I bought all new undergarments like boxer briefs, the white version of this shirt, and this (the black one) and all of them are great I wear them preferentially. SO if you're in between brands, or these are sitting in your cart, look no further. Especially if you hate shopping for clothes and your a simple man looking for value

  I went to buy some more T shirts and was shocked at the prices! My wife had always resupplied me at Christmas so I had no concept of price. Searched and these popped up as Amazon's choice. They're great, just the right weight, they fit well, and the neck is tough enough not to stretch out. I paid good money for some Hanes that never recovered after the first wash; these are holding up great.Edit after 6 washings: The sleeves are a little short, which I like but others may prefer sleeves a little longer. They shrink slightly when machine dried so if you're between a large and x-large go with the XL unless you like them snug. Still very happy with them.

  The initial fit of these shirts was as expected. Tag free neck is great. The packaging states that the shirts are made from ""premium soft cotton for all day comfort,"" but these are some of the roughest feeling T-shirts I have ever worn. They are not ""moisture-wicking"" (or maybe I don't know what this means) because after a light workout, the shirt looks like I've run a marathon, which never happens with my other T-shirts. After the first wash (machine-wash cold and tumble dry medium as stated by the instructions), the shirts all shrunk by 1-1.5 inches, but only lengthwise. I am worried to wash them again, otherwise I may end up with a midriff-baring crop top (Note: I am a male, and this look would not suit me very well). I can try and update this post if possible after my next wash, for those that are interested. Overall, I would recommend a different purchase if you are in the market to replace your current comfortable T-shirts

When we receive the T-shirts my husband was happy with the quality and the fit. They hold up well when you wash and dry them. They don’t discolor quickly at all. This item here is great when you need some new undershirts, right before the summer, etc. good for men and women.

  All shows in comparison. When I bought Banana Republic soft tee (yes, it is $20), I realized that I was wasting money on Guildan t-shirts. Day and night!  Now I cannot even put on Guildan t-shirts and will be disposing of them, since I see no use for the product. After using Banana Republic for few days, Guildan t-shirts seem harsh and deformed, not soft on skin, heavy, and very uncomfortable comparable to Banana Republic soft tees. The difference is obviously in much much quality of fabric and I guess we need to pay more for higher quality. The feel is more like Underarmour, another good option, but also more expensive. I wish Amazon focused more on quality vendors, reviews often don't tell much since they are often produced by people who did not have a chance to try high good quality products. It's all about price.

",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was looking for a t-shirt to replace the brand I have used for years that seems to have slipped in quality over time. I wear these shirts as an outer covering not an undershirt and I prefer them to be somewhat baggy and not clingy. I have worked out for years and even at 64 have some muscle still and prefer not to have shirts clinging to my arms and chest, but not be overly bagging so my neck is floating in a huge neck hole. These shirts appear to be my new go to and I have already ordered more.I purchased XXL even though I am more just XL to allow for some shrinking to get the fit I want. I washed them in warm water with other whites and dried them under high heat to shrink them up just a bit and now they are about perfect. The neck does feel a little backward when I first put one on, but I just stretch is slightly and all is well.They are the perfect weight fabric for my liking. Not see through by any means but not heavy so they feel comfy on those hot muggy days in Michigan. They might be just a tad long when worn outside, but I am a tucker for the most part anyway so not a big deal to me. They are not wrinkle free so I normally get them right out of the dryer, give them a shake and fold them for storage. So there are a few wrinkles when I first put one on, but after a bit they smooth out to a decent level - again for my tastes.It kind of depends on what you are looking for when it comes to t-shirts, so hopefully my review will allow others, who are looking for a similar fit, to make a purchasing decision.

  I have had these shirts for 3 months, and I primarily wear them under my police uniform. I have the black, crew neck, size large. They are perfect. The neck line is snug without being too tight, and it doesn't stretch out throughout my shift like other brands have (Hanes and FOTL). The shirt has a soft feel and is very comfortable, to the point that I often times wear it when I'm not in uniform. The sleeve length is proportionate to the size of the shirt and I have no issues with the t-shirts sleeves being too long to wear under a short sleeve uniform shirt. They have stood up to frequent trips through the laundry without losing their quality. As someone who is particular with t-shirt style and fit, I can say I highly recommend these, and the price can't be beat.

I'm 6' 230lbs and after washing and drying these shirts I can say that you should buy one size bigger. I see a lot of people bought these as undershirts. For me, I use these as everyday shirts.

    Standard undershirt, not nearly as fitted as product image
  
",3.0,Michael,"Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is a good multipack of standard undershorts. As far as size goes, it’s a standard medium you’d expect. The product images clearly show a much more tapered fit that some brands would call “slightly fitted” or “tapered”. These are NOT. They are standard straight-sided tees. Which is fine, these don’t claim to be, but the image used is plainly inaccurate.

The material feels good for the warm weather. Im currently wearing a fruit of the loom t and the material does feel slightly thicker. However again for the heat i wanted something less thick feeling but it doesn’t feel cheap either. The colors I received are the exact one’s from the picture. I checked every shirt for holes because i did see in some reviews people said they were messed up however none of the shirts were messed up. As far as them shrinking i am not sure i have not washed them yet.

  I normally wear size large t-shirts (5'9""/190lbs), but after reading the reviews I decided to buy XL and wash them in hot water. Pre-wash, they were just a tad long at the waist. Post-wash, just about perfect. Very comfortable, not too thin so that you can see thru the material, not to thick as to feel heavy.  Quality, no loose threads. Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is the company said ""pre-shrunk"" but they did shrink more after washing (with hot water).

",5.0,SLT,"Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2021","









  
  
    
  I got a good batch of 12 t shirts. Few strings hanging, but no holes/nothing major. The shirts aren't super soft nor too scratchy (which is good, for ironing out wrinkles). I think theyll shrink on high heat. But if your know how to wash clothes, u shouldnt have too many issues.These shirts aren't too thick nor too thin. So u can wear them like a normal top shirt. You won't be able to see much through the shirts (e.g., your orangutan nipples etc) UNLESS the shirt becomes wet, or u have some other color, besides white, underneath. I have a fat waist and gut- the XL size fits me perfectly. Shirts aren't super wide, but roomy enough whereas they wouldn't be tight around my fatty parts.My shirts were 29 inches long. So u can tuck in or not. If u want less length, just dry for a few mins on high heat to shrink. Only flaw might be the sleeve length. Only around 5 or so inches long under the arm. So if u raise your arms too high, your t shirt temporarily turns into a sleeveless shirt 😂 overall, it's a good year round t shirt.

  I don’t typically write reviews.But feel compelled as this is a horrible quality product.I don’t know where they sourced the cotton on this. But it gets worse wash after wash.The Denier, or density of thread  - a unit of measure for the linear mass density of fibers.In simple terms level of quality.  Think 400 thread count sheets vs. 1500.I wouldn’t use these T-Shirts even as rags in my garage as they will scratch what ever I wipe with it.The collar materials is even worse.  They actually created rub/skin tags on my neck.  And yes. I use Name brand Laundry Detergent (Persil) and Fabric Softener (Downy) on a Front load washing machine.I decided to try these instead of my go to “Kirkland Signature” brand. What an unfortunate experiment.The Kirkland held together for longer than expected, didn’t pit, and didn’t get holes.  The more I washed, the softer they became.If you have skin of steel and $10 bucks to waste.  Go for it.

  There are tons of tees out there that are softer ... but not lets be honest do you want to pay the 100+% increase for something like that.  These are not the softest but they are soft.

  For some reason, I can only wear and wash white t-shirts a small number of times or so before they are noticeably yellowed.  It's probably a combo of my sweat and the very hard water here.

I ordered like 10 of them and they all shrunk horizontally so bad (probably 4-5 inches) that they would not stay tucked and I was uncomfortable in them. I had to return them. Weird thing was they didn't shrink vertically. They just lost too much heighth so it's not like buying two sizes too big and letting them shrink would even be feasible.

  I bought these because they looked like a good deal. I usually buy a different brand, but they increase in price and added their name on the front of the shirts, so I bought these. While the fit was OK, they don't have a good feel on the skin and I probably won't wear them much. If Amazon keeps pushing such lousy products, I'm going to have to go back to shopping at department stores for everything.

  Just like the title says, for the money, these are a great bang for your buck. I’m sure amazon wasn’t happy with me buying and returning a bunch of shirts but after 3 or so returns I’ve concluded these aren’t just perfect, these are probably some of the best undershirts I’ve purchased in my lifetime.They’re not too thin/see-through, especially compared to similar shirts on the market (eg: Hanes/Fruit of the loom), the neck opening is just right, not wide and droopy, and the overall look and feel is very quality for the price. They’re obviously not good standalone TShirts but I’d say they’re very good undershirts. Especially for $2.50 a piece.

  Walmart quit carrying the Gildan crew neck shirts so I had to resort to buying them on-line. Gildan as ALWAYS been my favorite as the sleeves are a perfect fit (not too long or short) and they aren't overly thin/see through like other brands. . Gildan has been perfect. Although the one's I ordered online were longer (body of the shirt) than typical. More like the length of an actual t-shirt (if not longer) rather than an undershirt. But I can't complain. They are great to wear around the house, doing yard work, painting, work out in, etc and priced to where you can just throw them away when they get stained.

  These t-shirts are longer than any I've worn from other manufacturers.  They are at the least 6"" longer and remain long after washing.  My only suggestion is that they produce their boxer-briefs using the same colors.  Greys don't match, reds don't either.  The only ones that match are in black.  I also would like additional colors, Blue, Green.  If you are purchasing their boxer-briefs, as well, note that they are just the opposite.

I work in a factory so walking around and moving is constant and these absorb sweat well. Perfect for the price in my opinion. They are also not too loose to the point where they look very baggy, at least for someone with my body type.

One of the pictures led me to believe that these had a little extra length than normal t-shirts... it's my fault for not checking the size chart.I can't stick these in the dryer if I want them to suit my length. Hang out in the sun to dry only. They're borderline long enough when I got them. One machine dry and that's over with.The shoulder/sleeve/chest area is actually very flattering to my physique. If you have even just normal active guy muscle, these will make you ""pop"". The sleeves come down to a little less than half bicep coverage.The shirts are well worth the money, and they're true to size. I could have sized up when ordering just to get my length, but the shirt would have been baggy! I hate being tall and skinny sometimes.Order your normal size! You won't be disappointed.

  I apologize for my previous recommendation. This was made without consideration for use of the product over time. As soft as the shirts are, many developed large holes inside of 2-months of use. They are now used for polishing clothes for my cars. By contrast my much more expensive Jockeys have lasts for years. My take is the cotton is not wound nearly as tight as the Jockeys.Used Jockey all my life, but they are expensive. This pack was a bargain for sure, but  they run a little small (mainly because of my excessive paunch) . Will stick with the product but will order XXL instead of XL next time.

  I usually purchase Hanes for my husband, but he goes through white shirts like water since  he manages to get stains everywhere (I believe he thinks they 2nd as a napkin & im the miracle stain remover). So using bleach & soaking in stain removers all white tee’s start to wear down, get tiny holes, and the collar starts fraying. Figured I’d give these a shot for the price and we both love them! I’ve washed many many times and so far so good. Yes, they do shrink a little after the first wash but I expected that. Much better quality than I was expecting & a great value. . Remember this is an undershirt. They’re supposed to be a bit thinner. If you’re looking for a thicker & longer white shirt Kirkland’s pack of white t’s are super thick, durable & longer in length which is great for wearing alone but my husband found them to be too thick for himself in the summer or underneath his work shirts. If you’re looking for an undershirt this pack of Gildan’s are PERFECT! I’ve purchased these a few times now and prefer them over Hanes for the price. They’ve held up much better after being washed with bleach many many times compared to others I’ve washed the same. I don’t mind throwing a few out that I can’t remove the stains from. You can’t expect a luxurious cotton shirt at this price but you can buy 1 Higher end white t for a little more than the entire pack of 6 here, if you have higher expections for white undershirts at this price! Highly recommend for undershirts or those who go through white shirts like we do. Size up if you’re tall or need extra room, they shrink a little after the first wash/dry but so did the Hanes I always used to buy!

The fabric is comfortably woven and properly soft.I used to be a big fan of Stafford brand heavy weight t's for their fabric quality and fit.  I am just shy of 6' even and wear a 40 long or 42 regular jacket depending on actual cut. (Seriously, though? How can there be so much variation when the size is literally in measured lengths rather than S, M, L, etc.?). But lately, with J.C.Penney declines, I've been trying other brands. Hanes & Fruit of the Loom are readily available, but the shirts are shorter and much thinner/lighter weight fabric.These shirts are long - well below my belt, not too long, matching the length of most of my oxford/button down shirts and better quality polos.  I don't feel like they'll come out of my waistband and bunch in an unsightly lump under my tucked in shirt.  The sleeves are a good length - long enough they don't wad up in my armpits by midday and short enough to not stick out when worn under another short-sleeved shirt.I was a little skeptical about these because of the excellent price point.  I have had graphic t's (from local shops) that were on Gildan product, and been pleased with the quality.  But I thought these might be something different.  My doubts have been assuaged.  The neck and hem are holding up well after a couple of wearings.  The neck holds up remarkably well at the end of the day, especially when compared to other brands I have been wearing recently.Finally, overall I think the fit is excellent, probably what an ""L"" should have been all along.  I'm right on the line between M & L sizing and so getting a good fit is sometimes tricky.  Almost always the M is too small, short, & tight in chest and often an L in the same brand/style just feels too big.  Over the past few years, L's have been getting smaller (no, not because I'm getting bigger) especially in body length.  But these shirts are just right. for me.  (If I lose 15 lbs, they might be a little loose in the waist, so if you're the athletic type keep that in mind.)One thought on price - do the math, and I don't think you'll find many offers to compete. I get these for like two-sixty each and that wasn't even a ""deal"" price.  That makes these not only a good shirt, but a good value.

    Nice T Shirts

  I have 5 different type of t shirts now, the Hanes are like belly shirts on my average height frame and are the thinest and worst of the bunch.  I have three different type of Gildan, one long but thin material, one thick but mid length and this one which has the same product number and thickness as the mid length Gildans, but is long and stays tucked in.  These are my new favorites of all of them.  When I first got them I could not believe how big they were, but they shrunk considerably in the wash.  I am glad because they would be too big if they didn't.

  My husband goes through shirts left and right. Mainly because he works in every shirt I buy him regardless of how many times I tell him that are not for work. He's a mechanic and the uniforms they wear are scratchy so he always wears undershirts. These are great especially in summer since they aren't as thick as some t shirts. He likes to wear them as every day t shirts to and not just layered. He is typically a large but we always order a size up because after a few washes and dries they shrink a little and he likes to keep the legnth on them. As reference he likes his clothes loose but not baggy. Larges fit but he prefers Xl and they fit as expected either way. I will be buying these again.

  I was excited about the seemingly good quality of these for the price. But upon reciept, after I had already used 2 of them, found that the third one had a hole in the front. There was no piercing through the package, so it must have been a manufacturing defect. I was a bit disappointed because it was one of the black ones which I already had a plan for using.

  5'11"" ; 155lbs ; size: mediumI don't think I've ever hated a shirt more in my life. I don't think I've ever hated any shirt before, actually.. But these shirt are exceptionally garbage. I put one on right out of the package; it was too big. 100% cotton, it'll shrink. Lit.Washed and dried them all, and I'm writing this after wearing each of them once. Overall, I am like.. angry at these shirts. I mean it. These shirts suck so bad that I just want to kick something small and defenseless to let off some steam. Every single collar shrunk and is too tight, but the back still manages to hang down uncomfortably far. And I have a decently thin neck. I think it's like 15 inches, iirc. I've never worn a medium and thought the collar was too tight. Every medium I've ever bought has fit me; some better than others, sure, but this is my first time ever writing a passionate review ABOUT SHIRTS. Anyway, the sleeves poke straight out—like little goblin ears, right at the bottom of your shoulder muscle. And speaking of shoulders, the top of the sleeve, where the seams meet up.. that's like 0.75"" away from where it should be. AND LASTLY (I hate Gildan so much for forcing me to write such a long review; I'm busy, I don't wanna be doing this, but you forced my hand Gildan, you son of a bitch. You made such a terrible shirt that I felt FORCED to make time to let you know that I hate you and everyone else who was involved in the process of making these shirts), the bottom seam flips up. 6 our of 6 shirts, I could not make that bottom seam lay flat for more than 30 seconds.Love,JonP.S. Gildan, the fact that you thought I might enjoy any aspect of any of these shirts is offensive to me, and I consider it SIGNIFICANTLY disrespectful that you thought my standards were so low. I will fight you in a parking lot just to preserve my honor. Also, I'm not even going to donate these to Goodwill; poor people are honestly just better off naked.

  So first, these are not hanes or fruit of the loom.  These are quality shirts that I've been very surprised by over the past few months.  They are my best white tees, and I have a whole lot, with different brands.  I'd definitely buy them again.  They're the perfect length for under my button downs at work or atop blue jeans on the weekend.  They're nice n' thick and stay that way after repeated washings - and perhaps best of all, I've never had one of the collars roll on me like I've had Hanes or Fruit of the Loom do.  Good, quality merch!  Buy with confidence :)

",5.0,Roy Bradrick,"Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  We print up quite a few white T shirts each year for family events using Joleen iron-on transfers.  We have tried using other brands of white T shirts but have found that the Gilden shirts take the transfers better and tend to retain the transfer for  longer time.  We have Gilden shirts still in good shape after 3 years and normal washings.  Same can't be said of other major brands sourced at Big Box stores.  We had a disaster with some no-name bulk shirts sold from some on-line outlet for less.  Don't go that route.Unprinted leftovers have also served well as a normal undershirt.  I don't know the exact fabric composition but whatever it is, it takes iron-ons well and wears pretty good too.

  Undershirts are undershirts.  They're not made to look cool, but to prevent your good shirts from getting dirty.  As such they're okay.One thing I wish was different about these shirts, was that the neck on them was wider than a normal shirt, and the sleves slightly shorter than a normal shirt, so that you wouldn't be able to see a bit of the white undershirt when I wear other shirts.  Aside from that, these are okay.

  This is my second set of these.  Great product.  Great price.  Wash well, do not over shrink, and have worn very well, even when wearing as just a tee-shirt rather than an undershirt.As with all white shirts around your collor, they are subjuct to staining, depending on your skin type. (Oilly Italian here, so i just use a mixture of Dawn, hydrogen peroxide and backing powder (found on Pintrest) ... put on any yellowed areas with an old toothbrush...scrub it in some... try to let sit for at least an hour, or preferably over night, and then just wash as normal with other whites (HOT water)... PS: have a high efficency front-loading washer, where you can not use liquid bleach, or the rubber seals will begin to prematurely fail.  I find “Borax” or “Arm&Hammer Baking Powder Laundry Booster” works great as a substitute.  To like to use the extra rinse cycle when using these harsher chemicals.

  4-Star only because they are not made of Egyptian cotton, or the closest in quality, Pema cotton. Of course, Egyptian cotton would have quadruple the price. But would have also given them 5-Star rating.The feel is definitely smooth first time use, but once washed, that will change. That is the difference between Egyptian cotton and the rest of the world's cotton. I have purchased T-shirts while on a trip to Egypt. I have had them for 6 years now, and they are still as soft as the day I bought them from STIA in a Cairo suburban mall. They were ridiculously cheap, and will probably last another ten years. Had I known, I would have purchased the entire stock at the time.These shirts are perfect fit. Made in Honduras, one will not expect them to last more than a year, but they are inexpensive and replacing them should not bankrupt me.

  Normally I believe that you get what you paid for, but in this case I got 6 T-shirts for only $10 so I wasn’t expecting much. I wear t-shirts as undershirts and for working in the yard so I am not looking for something pretty. At 6/3” and 185 lbs, I normally wear a large tall, but when no tall option is offered an extra large usually works if it shrinks a little when washed. That is what happened with these and they fit perfectly now. I was afraid these t-shirts would be “seconds” or defective in some way at that price, about $1.70 apiece, but so far have found no flaws and they are not thin or cheap looking as some reviews claimed. I am usually skeptical of great reviews on Amazon and rarely give 5 stars to any product, but for the price, these are great.

  I like the weight of the T-shirt, however I was disappointed with the amount of shrinkage. After wash and dry they are closer to a small size. I find that I have to phuysically stretch the chest and arm holes to get a ""somewhat"" comfortable fit, but still too small. I purchased two of the 6 packs and unfortunately washed them all before drying so no opportunity for return.

    Good shirts, but pay attention to their sizing, especially if using as an undershirt
  
",4.0,Heath H.,"Reviewed in the United States November 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  Their sizing chart is pretty accurate if you pay attention to it.  If you don't want to measure, then I'd say buy one size smaller than you would either of the two major American brands (Hanes/Fruit of the loom) as these seem to be larger by named size.  I usually where a men's medium in those brands but this medium is bigger so I'll order a small when ordering next time.  But I wear them as undershirts so I like them a little snugger.

    Good basic layering t-shirt/undershirt.
  
",4.0,Keith Dunlop,"Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2019","









  
  
    
  These Gildan t-shirts are a good basic layering shirt for under an oxford or a sweater. The fit is spot on and matches my higher priced Calvin Klein undershirts (I'm 6'0"" 185 pounds and large is just right). The quality is not quite as good as my CKs -- the fabric is not quite as soft and construction looks cheaper, but for the price they serve their purpose. Also, after one wash there is a bit of shrinkage in the sleeve length and overall length, and there was a minor amount of pilling to the fabric. The length after wash is about the same as the CK and I think they would stay tucked to a pair of chinos just fine.  Overall, a good undershirt that meets the need for a fraction of higher priced alternatives.

  The price was so cheap, it feels like I robbed the bank and got away with it!  These shirts are quite nice and feel every bit as good as anything you'd buy at the store.  Nice color combo (the charcoal gray color was unexpectedly cool).  I washed them on cool and dried them on low and didn't have any noticeable shrinking compared to a brand new shirt that had not yet been worn - I did this just to ensure an accurate way to measure for shrinkage.  Great shirts.  I'm going to buy at least another round of them.  At this price, you'd be nuts not to stock up.  Going to get some white ones, too.

  I ordered the all black pack of XL shirts. I usually get XL anyway and when sizes run small a 2XL. These fit perfectly. They're not too hot at all and not too thin either. I can tell you, if you work in warehouse or construction and usually get a lot of holes in your clothes, these won't last long but you gotta remember these are cheap shirts and usually meant to be an undershirt!!! Also, I have been working warehouse and roofing and I prefer these so I don't get as hot as I do in more durable clothes. I don't mind spending a few bucks every 4-6 months for new shirts.

  This is not an undershirt as they are WAY too short. I am only 5’8” and these don’t stay tucked at all. The arm holes fit better than Jerzees and Fruit of the Loom. These are nowhere near as soft as the Hanes, but are cheaper and thicker which is good for colder weather. I’m considering cutting one up to sew pieces on the bottoms of others to make them longer and stay tucked.

  If this is heavyweight, then I don't know what that means anymore. Both sleeves and tail are short to begin with, even shorter after first wash. Will probably be okay under a shirt or sweater, unsuitable for wearing alone. Mine were in perfect shape, no loose threads, etc., but I wouldn't buy them again due to the shrinkage and the sleeves were too short before washing. Well, they were inexpensive . . .

Bottom line, I'm pleasantly surprised by the quality of these shirts. They are crazy soft and my new favorite.

The one issue I have with these shirts is the length, they are so long I do not need to wear pants anymore. They fit good around the chest and stomach but the length seems a little bit long to me. I don't think anybody's going to say anything about a guy walking around in this long black T-shirt with no pants wearing tube socks and Tennis Shoes. So that's my style moving forward. It even covers my dangly bits.  I do have to say though because I live in Arizona it's good that this shirt is so long I don't have to wear pants for two reasons, I can save money on pants in the future and it's so hot here in the summertime it's like I'm walking around in a summer dress.

  My husband loves these shirts. He is VERY picky when it comes to comfort especially with undershirts. I have only heard good things come out of his mouth while wearing these. They are soft and true to size. He wears them under his work shirts and none have stretched or gotten that “bacon neck” even though he works in manufacturing. I’m impressed.

  Some people will say and probably leave t-shirts or t-shirts but let me tell you something for the price of these, they are not the cheap shirts that I bought in the past from China in fact which is where these are from but they are much heavier and the price cannot be beat I plan on buying many more I do have one not a gripe just a concerned, I am a great Patriot of this nation and I love the warrior 12 line of patriotic t-shirts however on their own website they offer and not all the time but for a great amount of time they offer 25% off and sometimes you can free shipping and even though I don't mind paying the 25.95 for a shirt just the $6 shipping is an issue however Petty and small you might think I am but I keep an eye on things like that the actual manufacturing website as opposed to Amazon and a lot of the times Amazon when but this time you don't but that won't dissuade me from buying shirts in the future by any stretch of the imagination so keep up the good work fellows!

  These are ok. So far so good. . They are long and I would say  shirts to wear under shirts. I’ll wear them around the house but wouldn’t wear them to go out to a bar etc. because they are too long for that. black shirts have more polyester than the other shirts.

  I liked these shirts quite a bit out of the package. They aren't especially soft but not that cardboard feel of some cotton shirts either. I'm 5'10"" ~165 lbs., and usually I'm somewhere between a medium (tall) or a large (slim) in a lot of brands. Especially with cotton, I err on the side of large, so that's what I ordered with these. The fit was fine until I washed them. I dried on low heat and pulled them out before they were completely dry. Unfortunately, they shrank enough that I can still wear them, but it's borderline - the exact type of shirts I was hoping to replace. The hem at the bottom now folds up like many cheap shirts, and I can't go up to an XL or it will be too boxy. The main thing I look for in Tees is fit, and these just don't fit well now. I had a package of black ones in my cart ready to buy but that's off the table now. Buy at your own risk.

    Better as an Undershirt Only. Beware of Shrinkage!
  
",5.0,Rico Suave,"Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  So I began working full time in sales and I was constantly needing to wash my undershirts. I started looking for the least expensive shirts I could find since they were only going to be worn under my collared shirts. These were a great value as they hit all the marks on wjat I was looking for. These are lightweight, inexpensive and breathable. They are 100% cotton so expect some shrinkage (they fit a bit large initially, but fit me perfectly after they were washed).The material is very thin and there are a few defects so I would avoid wearing these by themselves unless you are doing something where you want to wear a shirt you don't mind ruining.

  I'm used to Hanes shirts, and these are very comparable in quality and fit. The large fits my 6'1"" frame correctly.My minor complaint is that the arm holes and girth around the belly is ever so slightly larger than the Hanes, which are also too large. My arms are not small, and there is so much material in the arms that they flare out and minimize the appearance of my physique. The length could be just a tad longer too (perhaps half an inch). I realize these are undershirts and wear them as such, but I would prefer that they were more form-fitting. I realize they are necessarily made larger to accommodate heavier guys (I'm 190lbs), but they just aren't quite what I was hoping to get.For the price, these are a fantastic buy.

",5.0,Moises,"Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2021","









  
  
    
  Bought these a couple of times now and they're becoming my favorite t-shirts in my wardrobe. I usually buy whatever is cheapest or on sale do I have a mix of Hanes fruit of the loom and other brands. Lately I've noticed that most brands are starting to use less cotton and more polyester. That's great if you want a shirt that washes and wears well but the pure cotton shirts are a lot more comfortable. These are 100% cotton and because of that they do shrink a bit. I buy my size and purposely shrink them in the wash because I like a snug form fitting undershirt. That's the way we wore them when I was in the service and I like a neat tight collar. These are great for that. If you like a looser shirt I recommend buying a size larger and shrink them. They will only shrink once and after that you have a great looking comfortable t-shirt. These look and feel better than the rest of the brands I have and notice when a fresh load of laundry is finished these are the first tshirts I grab out of the closet. I also think the elastic in the collar last longer on these shirts and the collars themselves are better and more comfortable that other shirts.

  I purchased these to replace some now impossible-to-find Fruit of the Loom stay-tucked shirts that I had worn out.  These are decent shirts, but they don't measure up to the ones I replaced.  The shirts are of average length, sitting at about 5"" below the belt.  The shirts stretch horizontally, but not vertically.  While this makes for a comfortable fit, they do not want to stay tucked when you bend over or squat.The material seems slightly thinner than Hanes or FotL, and slightly less soft.  It's still good enough in both regards, just not great.  The sleeves bunch up at the end after being washed and dried.  They stretch back out again just fine, but this will cause some wrinkles around the sleeve when they are folded.  Not a big deal for an undershirt, but still a minor nuisance.  The collar and waist do not bunch up for some reason.Overall, this is a so-so shirt.  Not great, not terrible.  It gets the job done, and if coming untucked is not an issue for you, these are a good and inexpensive option.

  Gildan is my go to brand for shirts now. They are comfortable & affordable & fit me pretty well. Originally I got them in an XL size(which felt more like a 2XL) so I went with the large which fits me much better. I love the black & dark grey shirts but I’m not so crazy about the light grey ones. I would have much rather have traded them for one more dark grey & one more black shirt had they had that option.

  I purchased a 2xl and hooly cow. These actually came a bit bigger than I expected haha. I would say the 2xls look like a 3xl mostly, however, i love my shirts baggy and im considering buying more just to sleep in. I bought these for my hair initially but they are so comfortable to lounge around in

  I used to order promotional T-shirts at work and Gildan was my go-to brand as they held ink well, were comfortable & durable and the fits were consistent. Because I usually worked the events I always got a shirt or two. Over 21 years in that position, my wardrobe mainly consists of these promotional T-shirts. I ordered these plain colored shirts for my personal wear as they are timeless colors and I don't feel like a walking billboard on my personal time. I would highly recommend these T-shirts for general all around wear.
