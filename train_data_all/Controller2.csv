  I bought this to replace the controller that my roommate broke, I was happy with it for all of 30 minutes. I love the texturing  on this controller, it feels great in your hand. I also like the screenshot button.Now for the downside: It constantly disconnects while playing. I know it isn't something weird with my system as my other controller is doing just fine. Also, it runs on batteries. There's no rechargeable pack- it can't even fit the rechargeable packs from my other controller because the shape of the controller is different. I expected more for paying like $16 more than my previous controller.I'll be returning this.

    Good for Windows, Low Quality Construction Warrants Choosing SONY PS5 as Console
  
",3.0,Jay,"Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  I am a PC gamer and purchased this controller to play Genshin Impact. This is primarily due to poor support for the Switch Pro and DualSense 5 controllers. That being said, this controller does what it needs to do without the need for 3rd party mapping software, and the rumble feature works fine.That's basically it for all the positive aspects for this controller.Now for the cons: the buttons on this thing are uncomfortable and feels cheap. Compared to SONY and Nintendo controllers, the travel distance for all the buttons (A,B,X,Y + D-Pad) are too far and feels cheap and plasticky. Each button press generates an annoying and hollow plastic click. My thumb gets tired a lot quicker pressing the aforementioned buttons. If you own a SONY or Nintendo controller, do a side by side comparison and you'll see what I mean.TL;DR - great software support, HORRENDOUS build quality.

  First thing I noticed right when I opened the box for this controller is that it's made in China. Sad to say in the first two weeks of gameplay I've noticed the joysticks already beginning to wobble, I imagine it'll get worse. I'm sad because this controller feels so much better than the previous version. For context, I'm not a pro or regular gamer. Very casual on my part. And yet...

  It's a good controller, but it feels like they took both a step forward and back from the Xbox One controller. Also, controls through Bluetooth are jumbled up in some games.Pros:- The Xbox controller design and layout. It's still as great as ever.- The redesigned D-pad is easier to use.- The controller is a tiny bit smaller and feels much better sized in my hands.- They replaced the shiny black texture on the bumpers and triggers with a better matte texture.- The menu buttons feel more clicky and are more responsive.Cons:- Controls are straight up broken in some games when the controller is connected through Bluetooth. They get all jumbled up, like A becomes X, B becomes A, and RT becomes the start button. It works normally when connected through a cable or the Xbox Wireless Adapter. I don't know what the problem is, but they need to fix this ASAP. It's been a while since release and there still has been no recognition of this problem.- You need to update the firmware to use it on Bluetooth. You need a cable or the Xbox Wireless Adapter to update the firmware. The controller comes with neither.- The grip textures are irritating on my hands. It feels like you're holding a man's bearded face. I don't understand why they had to ruin the controller like this. All they had to do was keep it smooth.- The buttons, including the D-pad, are significantly louder than the Xbox One controller.- The share button does nothing on PC.I recommend holding off on this controller until they fix the Bluetooth issue at least. The grip textures ruin the controller for me personally. The Xbox One controller is still available and a much better option at this point. If you still have an Xbox One controller, there is no reason for you to get this one.

Simply, I can't say enough good about this controller.

  Only had a couple of days, but enjoying it so far. Sold my Xbox One controller with my console, and using it primarily for PC. Like the Xbox One controller it gets detected fine in Windows/Steam (actually AS a Xbox One controller). The USB-C port is a nice new touch instead of micro USB. Textured grips, triggers, and bumpers feel really good.All buttons feel responsive and good. Kind of lackluster share button for PC and I wish there was an easy way to rebind this.D-pad feels really great and tactile and all buttons have a nice click/activation feel. However the big issue with the D-pad is the noise! It's so clicky and loud. Considering it feels good to use and time might wear out the volume a bit it's not a huge deal to me but I do miss the less annoying D-pad of the controller this replaced.Last thing to note is it actually feels a bit better in hand than the Xbox One controller for smaller hands, not sure what they changed but it's more comfortable for me.Time will tell on durability, volume of buttons, and build quality. First impressions are positive though, not much different than the standard Xbox One/S/X controllers. But the small changes to things like D-pad, textured triggers, USB-C, and other minor changes are a positive in my book.

  ¬†Disconnects constantly on PC. I had zero connectivity issues ever with my Xbox One controller, but I got tired of resyncing between Xbox and PC when I wanted to swap platforms, so I bought this to be a dedicated PC controller and I'm very disappointed so far. Internet searches reveal this to be a common issue, and if it doesn't get addressed soon this thing is going back (I've had it for two days and the disconnections started immediately). I will edit this review if a solution is found.Edit: I THINK I found a fix, but time will tell. I updated the controller's firmware (didn't fix it), updated an ""optional"" Bluetooth driver in Windows (didn't fix it), then I got mad and went scorched earth and unpaired the device entirely, went into device manager and deleted the device and drivers for the Windows default Xbox 360 controller, then when I went to repair the controller it popped up a very specific Xbox Wireless Controller with a series of numbers after it and not just Xbox Wireless Controller and it seems to be working now. I just played for like a half an hour with zero disconnections. I will be editing my 1 star review to 3 stars at this time, because the controller feels good (analog sticks and triggers are great), but I can't give it higher because of the inherent connectivity issues.

  I like all the changes they made to the new controller. This review is by a PC gamer, I've never actually had an Xbox.-The triggers are a matte hard rubber black texture with small bumps. They are much easier to press down and the texture feels way better. The One X had weird slippery plastic bumpers and triggers that made games that use the bumpers a lot (for example, Dark Souls) a bit less comfortable than a PS controller. The bumper feedback is much more of a deep bump than the plasticy click of the old controller and I like it.-The grips have a micro-texture as well which makes that controller less slippery in that aspect as well.-The circular directional pad with raised arrows are very clicky, much louder than the One X directional cross. Most games just use the directional buttons for activating items, menus, etc. However I am not much of a fighting game player so I would read other reviews who might have stronger feelings about this change.-Type-C cable instead of micro-USB. That means faster charging if you buy the optional rechargeable battery pack.-The controller is a tiny bit heavier, and feels solid. My old One X controller squeeks and crackles a little bit if I squeeze the controller, the Series X makes no audible noise from strongly squeezing the grips. I would say the build quality got an upgrade, but we will have to see if that lasts with age/use.So yeah, i'd say it's a straight upgrade, but it's not so different that you need to rush out and buy a new one right away.****Weird note! For whatever reason the controller had all kinds of small dust particles on the outside, fresh from the sealed box. I don't know why that was, but it came right off so it might just be a warehouse thing.

  Overall the controller feels a bit more sturdy than previous controllers but time will tell. Every other xbox controller has failed me after a year or so and of course they don't replace them under warranty.My reason for 3/5 stars is because most of the buttons are unnecessarily loud. YXBA buttons and the D-pad are just really annoying. I don't understand why they would do this. The feedback is good but all the clicking is just a huge turnoff. Playing RDR2 for example, when you have to constantly tap A to ride your horse gets old after a while and it's even worse with a loud button.I may end up returning it but it might be fine for driving games where you're using the triggers a lot more than the other buttons. Really disappointing.

  This new design Xbox Core Controller is actually good. This controller is compatible with all consoles in the Xbox One or newer Xbox Series X|S. Essentially, it is the same controller you get along with the new XBOX one X from Microsoft. The feel and button layout is exactly the same as original XBOX one with one major difference being that it uses USB-C port rather than Micro-USB on the older model. The 3.5mm audio jack and the auxiliary port on the bottom edge of the controller are still present to support various older accessories. It also features a ""share button"" which I haven't used it yet.PS: I can state the use and operation with respect to a XBOX console. I have not used this with Windows 10 Laptops or PCs with Bluetooth etc.. Anyways, You need to get yourself a¬†

  
USB-C to USB-A









  
  
    
  ¬†cable and update the controller firmware by connecting this to your XBOX one console first before you can use this controller reliably. Once the firmware gets updated you can configure and use the controller to Automatically log you into XBOX live.Overall this is an essential product to play games on XBOX one S/X and it is always good to have couple of them around and play games in ""Co-pilot"" mode. Good quality controller .. Rating the product with five stars!

  FIRST THING TO DO AS YOU GET THE CONTROLLER:Make sure that you update the controller's firmware through the Xbox Accessories app from the Microsoft Store so you can install the latest firmware update for the controller. Once done, it will work better on your PC especially when using the steam client. When you have the latest update installed, just remove the Xbox wireless controller device from the bluetooth devices menu on your PC and then pair it back to get it up and running.NOW TO THE REVIEW:As I opened the box and held the controller into my hands for the first time I was already hooked. The older xbox controllers were great, but they added a few improvements that makes the series X/S controller better.The controller feels much better in the hands since it's a tiny bit smaller than it's predecessors. There's now a share button that gives you the option to record gameplay and take screenshots with just a single button press. The hybrid directional pad fells so nice when you press on it due to it's louder clicky sounds that it makes while gaming. I just love the strong feedback that it gives which you can hear and feel. The textured grips along the controller's side handles and triggers makes the experience just even better. This is just a fantastic comfortable controller to hold while your playing games on your TV screen, computer monitor, or phone screen with a gaming clip as your playing thru the Xbox Game Pass application.Overall, the new xbox series X/S controller is a nice improvement than it's older counterparts without Microsoft ruining anything from it, but has added some tweaks to the controller that the user would love. üëå

  Maybe my expectations are high because I've been using my Elite 2 controller a lot lately, but even this controller feels cheap and plasticky compared to my two white Xbox one S controllers and my black Xbox one X controller. It feels a lot more like the cheap original Xbox one controller. However, it makes up for this with a slightly better D-pad, share button, textured grip and triggers, and suppposedly lower latency. However, I personally don't think this is worth the extra money unless you absolutely need an extra controller, which I don't. I'm contemplating on returning it.

  The placement of the new share button is incredibly annoying. It will CONSTANTLY try to upload game video clips from accidental button presses. This is on top of the controllers overall smaller size being slightly too small for full grown hands.The new share button being dead center between and slightly below the old start and select buttons means it keeps getting accidentally pressed if you have larger hands. When this happens the controller automatically tries to upload a game clip to Xbox Live. This is INCREDIBLY ANNOYING and there is no way to disable this function to keep the controller from trying to upload video clips when the share button is pressed. You can make the function a short or a long press in the controller app but that does not disable accidental uploads.You can also disable uploads in your Xbox Settings menu, but this does not stop the controller itself from trying to upload video clips. You will simply get a pop up notification in the middle of your game that the video clip upload failed. Over and over and over and over again you will see this message pop up in the middle of your game because of accidental share button presses.This new controller is a step down from the old design.

  I purchased the Xbox One controller because I've recently purchased a new Windows 10 PC and needed a decent controller to game with. The reviews for the Xbox One controller were decent on PC Mag so I decided to purchase it. After reading the description of the product, per my screenshot, you can see it states that this controller is compatible with Windows 10 PCs. Unfortunately, after trying to sync the controller to my PC I realized it won't connect unless you have Xbox Wireless setup on your PC or you own the wireless adapter. Which is ridiculous considering they don't state that in the description. I thought there might be some Bluetooth capabilities with this controller, but still no connection.If you're looking to purchase this controller to hook up with your Windows PC, DON'T DO IT!Another issue, looking at the packaging you can obviously tell someone tried to put a seal where the seal should be. When I opened the package, the controller was moved around and all the pages weren't together. Some were above the controller, others were under. It looks like this was used.Overall, I'm very disappointed. If it wasn't for the fact that the Xbox controllers were so ergonomic, I would have made the product rating one star.

  I bought one of the new generation controllers for my xbox one. It was great at first but I've only had the controller for two months and I'm already experiencing sticky triggers. The right trigger on my controller sticks when pressing on it with force, something you usually see after a year or two of usage. Really annoying and a disadvantage for any competitive player... I've seen numerous complaints about this online with absolutely no response from Microsoft, unacceptable!

  Update 01/05/21:Dropping this review down to one star. Still disconnects even two feet from the USB Bluetooth Device. I've updated the Bluetooth driver, Windows 10, and Controller firmware. None of it appears to work.I bought this Controller to play games on the PC. Connecting the controller initially wirelessly was a breeze but it kept disconnecting. So I disabled my onboard Bluetooth and switched to a Pluggable closer to where I was sitting. That worked better but it still sporadically disconnects.Pros: It works well with the PC. Games picks it up a lot easier than other Controller's. It uses standard AA batteries which I personally really like because it means I don't have to keep it charged at all times. Rechargeable AA batteries are cheap and plentiful plus batteries eventually die so it means longer life.Cons: Compared to the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller the plastic feels cheaper. Both Controller's use hard plastic but the Xbox controller definitely feels cheaper. As I mentioned above, Bluetooth connection seems weak.

    An (almost) perfect reimagining
  
",5.0,Darnell,"Reviewed in the United States December 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  Although there's been a lot of buzz (and rightfully so) around the new Dualsense PS5 controller, Microsoft decided to take a very different approach from Sony; meaningful, iterative improvements to an already solid base. The first version I ever used, model 1697, was the best controller I had ever used up to that point. It was the primary reason I switched from my XB360, as I was unable to pair it with the console, but the controller was too good to go back. Clicky, responsive buttons, lighter weight, easily accessible battery door, good battery life, solid accuracy and excellent haptic feedback in the triggers made me fall in love. Jump to the next model, the 1708, and all those things remained, but there was a different finish and now the awesome addition of Bluetooth. This has been the controller I've used on console and PC for the better part of 5 straight years. I've even tried to pair it with a couple Sony systems to experience some of the better games exclusive to that platform (I was unsuccessful BTW). Now, introduce this model, the 1914, and I feel like it's 2 steps forward and a step backwards. The D-Pad is outrageously good and responsive, the trigger texturing gives a more involved feel, the matte finish makes it less vulnerable to oils or greases making it slippery and the battery door redesign is a very slight but meaningful touch. Even the added feature of showing the battery level on PC is a tiny detail that shows the thoughtfulness that went into crafting this. The only reason this is not a 5 is the connectivity. Full disclosure, this is primarily used with a PC in this use case, and as such, you WILL need the XBox accessories app, as I needed to apply an update fresh out the box. The Bluetooth connection on my 1708 literally never dropped out in my entire memory of use. Extremely strong, very dependable and no lag to speak of. The 1914, not so much. There's been no observable lag, and when it works, it's easily better, but the connection is very spotty. As mentioned, an update was necessary right out of the box, and performance marginally improved, but as it stands, during a 3 hr play session last night it lost connection at least 10 times, with the Xbox light blinking a few times and going solid again roughly every 20 mins or so. I tried multiple games, including very tight shooters and it's the same thing; excellent performance when it's working, a temporary drop for no more than 5 seconds, then back to working as if nothing happened. I've already gone the driver route of making sure everything is updated correctly, but this seems to be more a 1914 problem, as the 1708 has never had this problem with a console or 3 different PCs with 3 different Bluetooth adapters. Funny though, a wireless adapter is available, and is touted as the primary way to connect without a USB cable (the USB cable does work flawlessly BTW). Of course, there is a fee for this adapter, which makes me feel like this is the classic create a problem, sell the solution sort of scenario, which has soured my experience greatly here. This is a relatively new device, having only been on the market for a little over a month at the time of this writing, so it's definitely possible for this issue to be resolved, but there's currently no discount for this unit, so you're being asked the complete price for an incomplete experience for the time being. Once (if) this issue is resolved, I will absolutely change this to a 5, but right now, with the drops, it's a mediocre purchase at best, with the 1708 currently being a better option, and at a lesser price. Best of luck.Edit: In order to have the update applied, you must FIRST connect to the PC with your USB-C and use the Xbox accessories app to update, then, most importantly, you must UNPAIR the controller if it was previously paired. If it's the first time pairing, it won't be an issue, but if you previously were paired before the update, it will not apply. After following these steps, I can confidently report all connection issues have been fixed, and there have been no Bluetooth drops to speak of. This is now a 5 star device.

Everything else feels the same as the previous one. Possibly the perfect controller.The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because the Bluetooth compatibility is still kinda wonky. At the time of writing this review, this controller does not work with the Steam Link device over Bluetooth, only through wired USB connection. It also has some issues when connecting to a Windows PC over Bluetooth. It'll work with some games, and not with others. It works fine with a wired connection though.

  I had this controller delivered in mid-November of 2020. It is now February 2nd of 2021 and BOTH of my control sticks drift upward sharply (non-stop input, and if you play smite, picture your camera panning up to your character's butt facing the sky within 2 seconds of you not actively controlling it, while also struggling to recall because your character keeps moving until you finagle the stick into true neutral.)The cause of this? I dropped the controller one single time. It was about a foot and a half onto carpet, landing on its side. It didn't even land on the face of the controller. That one single miniscule-impact fall now has both of my control sticks permanently out of alignment and a nonstop nuisance.Also, as other reviews have stated, bluetooth on these controllers is complete junk. It's annoying to set up (including needing to be wired in the first place to do that, so good luck if your controller didn't come with an adequate cable) and doesn't work properly. My controller reads every main face button (A,B,X,Y) as an input of two different buttons and no amount of configuration in the accessories app could fix it, in addition to the control stick reading a constant diagonal movement that leads to my character in smite or fighting games constantly spinning in a circle. I had to use a bluetooth adapter dongle my brother gave me to make the controller behave, and then the small drop happened and it's now useless for fighting games and a nuisance on smite anyway.This controller lasted me less than 3 months and required a purchase of additional hardware to use. DO NOT BUY IT if you're not specifically in need of one for use with the Series X. The only reason I'm not giving it a 1-star is because the controller itself feels like an improvement over the previous xbox controller due to increased weight, a better gripped back surface, and a significant improvement on the directional pad.

  I love this controller.Grip feels better, feels slightly more compact and heavier than the last controller. Buttons are slightly clicky, but less so than say, a Nintendo Joycon.I ran into one issue initially, when connecting via Bluetooth, Windows only recognized it as a ""D-Input"" controller, and the triggers didn't respond. I applied the firmware update, still nothing.I saw it was recommended to update to the newest version of Windows 10, the 20H2 update. Once I did, the controller shows as an X-Input controller.Not sure if it is just my imagination, but this thing is fast. I could usually perceive the slightest input lag with bluetooth controllers, now it also feels like it's responding a millisecond before I even complete the button press.

  The controller works great with PC. However, out of the box the Bluetooth feature does not play well with Steam. In order to get it to work, there are a few steps you‚Äôll have to do.1. Download the Xbox Accessory App on the Microsoft store.2. Connect the controller with a USB-C cable3. Update the controller4. Pair with windows Bluetooth devices5. Start steam and it should recognize it as Xbox Series X/One controller.5(a). If you paired it before doing these steps (like me). Follow steps 1-3, then go to ‚ÄúBluetooth devices‚Äù remove the device and repair it. Then it should work with no issue.Build: The controller itself is very sturdy and has nice textured grips on the back as well as the triggers. Size is pretty similar to previous Xbox controllers.Battery: I can‚Äôt really comment on battery life since I just got it but I would imagine many of you will have some form of rechargeable battery.Wireless: I haven‚Äôt had any issues since pairing it nor experience any types of interference with my other wireless peripherals. The range seems good, I‚Äôm roughly 15ft away from my TV/desktop.Overall, it‚Äôs a much better controller then my ps4 controller. It plays well with Windows 10 as one would hope and once setup with Steam the buttons are automatically mapped.

  I purchased this controller because I bought a gaming Laptop but wanted to be able to use a controller when i was traveling to make things a bit easier. I bought this controller for that purpose and was excited that it could be used via Bluetooth on PC. I was able to get the controller connected to my PC via bluetooth but proceeded to have issues with games recognizing it as a controller (the main one being Warzone).I have given this product 4 stars because while it does connect to PC it's use is limited without the Xbox One Wireless Adapter for PC which is another $30. Once I received the adapter and paired them together the games I was having issues with will now recognize the controller.If you intent to use this on PC i would highly suggest that you get the adapter regardless in order to prevent the same frustration as well as have improved reaction time the wireless adapter has over bluetooth.

  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.










  
  
    
  ¬†I'll start this off with what I don't like. It's design does not support Rechargeable Extended Battery Packs. Why? Because there are two holes at top of controller where the Battery packs have tabs that help it click in that do not line up correctly. Rechargeable battery packs are useless on this  controller. Even if you are able to click the battery pack in place, as I tweaked mine to do, the controller won't even turn on. The terminals do not connect. I've tried 4 different Rechargeable Battery Packs and same issue with all of them. The battery packs work great on standard Xbox controllers, such as the ones from Microsoft or the ones that came with the Xbox, but do not work on this controller which is incredibly annoying. I don't like using batteries. I have Rechargeable Battery Packs for a reason as so many others do as well who will also find this controller useless. So, unless you don't care to use the Rechargeable Battery packs you'll be good with standard batteries, but if your like me, you'll be left frustrated & highly disappointed because other than that the controller seems to be made well & feels great in the hand. 2 stars... That's what this controller gets... Almost a 1 star... Very disappointed.

  Bought this controller on launch day.  At first, was only able to get the controller to work in Windows 10 with Steam using a USB-C cable.  I downloaded the Xbox Accessories App from the Windows store and updated the controller firmware.  Then, I fully updated Windows 10, rebooted my laptop, and removed and re-added the controller via Bluetooth.  Bluetooth works fine now in Windows 10 and Steam.  I like the matte finish of the controller.  Also, I like the textured triggers.  Button clicks are a little loud.  Would have been nice to have a USB-C cable included but I have a few cables laying around.  After a little struggle with the setup, I like the feel of this controller.

    The best pc controller
  
",5.0,Snakker,"Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2021","









  
  
    
  As a picky pc gamer I absolutely recommend this controller for anyone considering getting one for general gaming, first person shooters (yes, I know theres a keyboard and mouse) and 2d platforming. I'm no pro fighting game guy so can't say if i'd recommend for that but I don't see why it wouldn't be a good optionI see the battery compartment as a big plus as this prevents long term head aches changing a li ion battery, if you are into recharging that way you can get the replaceable li ion battery plus 9 foot cable and you are set.Bluetooth connectivity and wired are super easy to set up and have great latency either way. The only downside is if you want to use wired headphones through your controller you have to use the windows wireless adapterThe texturized grip feels great and really does help with sweaty hands for example in intense multiplayer action or when trying to beat a particullarly tough foe in sekiro for example.Feel in hand is premium, there is no plastic play and squeaky sounds if you grip it hard like in previous models, it feels solid.The dpad, front facing buttons and shoulder buttons are very tactile and give an audible feedback, wether or not you are into that is personal prefierence, for me its quite satisfying. I've heard of cases where the Y button is not very responsive but so far I have no such issues and thoroughly tested itOverall an excellent, stylish, comfortable, versatile controller. Very easy to set up and with great compatibility around the board. That's why I give it a 5 out of 5

  I paid for an official Microsoft device because I thought it would avoid flakiness.Unfortunately, this has not turned out to be true. I've tried the controller on Bluetooth, on multiple computers. I've tried it with a new Microsoft XBox wireless dongle, again on multiple computers. In all cases I've been sitting within a few feet of the computer, so distance should not be a problem.But, on bluetooth or Xbox dongle, I've found the same thing. The controller connection has drop-outs - as evidenced by the controller indicator going into ""flashing"" mode for 20 seconds or so. This consistently happens every few minutes, which makes it painful to keep playing with it.There seems to be no reasonable cause for  this. I use other bluetooth devices (e.g.: headsets) on the same computers at the same time, and do not experience drop-outs with them.

  The battery compartment is shaped differently than previous versions so you won't be able to use the same rechargeable packs you will have to order a different set for the newer model.  All in all its a good controller.  It is sensitive to some cell phone signals and they can cause disruption and make your controller glitch. If you want better control I suggest a pro controller.

  The texture is great; I have always used a skin or grips (and until recently, those were all garbage, IMO, except for Dragon Skinz IINM). I like that the charging port is now USB C, as I can now toss that basket full of micro USB cables. I don't care about the share button, but someone probably loves that. Dpad definitely feels better, but I don't use it much in gameplay.Mainly, I'm happy to have a working controller, and I'm content with this one because of the preorder pricing, quick delivery, and I was able to get a refund for the defective controller I bought a few weeks back. Take one of those factors out of the equation, and it's a lot less attractive purchase.

The only problem I have is that I also bought rechargeable battery packs and I found out the hard way that,  for whatever reason, the slots that the battery cover slide into are lined up differently from standard controllers to this one.
