    This stuff is amazing
  
",5.0 ,Coffee lover,"Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2021","









  
  
    
  The smell and the bubbles that you get out of this product are just great. I found that using this creates a better and stronger smell than using lavender bath bombs and you get the fun bubbles on top. Also the bottle is huge I have used it 4 times now and I still got so much left in the bottle it really is a steal for the price.

  The scent is great but when buying a bubble bath, I look for one that can yield a great amount of suds.  This one didn't do that.  I had to use a lot to get an OKAY amount of bubbles.  For Pain Relief, you may want to go with Epsom Salt for that.  This one was more for relaxation.  This was okay.  I don't think I would buy again.

  I honestly wanted to love this, but I found myself using soo much to get a good amount of bubbles. And I have a standard tub. So although the price is great you are using an insane amount, to get the result you want. But I guess the result is achievable so that's a plus.

  If you pour the product beneath the spout right as the water is filling your tub you will get the most bubbles. The ingredients seem fine to me. Although the lavender smell is not strong and isn’t the best smelling. However, it does have the Epsom salt and it makes a great combo. The price is amazing to! I give 3 stars! Not the best but really not bad either! I have sensitive skin and I seemed to be okay so far and I’ve used this twice now. The major thing I did not like was it was not sealed. I ordered twice because the first one came with stuff all over the bottle. Neither one was sealed. Can’t say my pain level is different but my skin feels amazing! Soft.

  The bottle leaked a little bit in transit, but because of the way it was wrapped & sealed, no harm done to the other items in my box, which I appreciated. It has a lovely lavender scent. I only wish the cap had a lever for easy pouring, instead of having to pour from the full bottle, which tends to drip down the side.

  Purchased 2 at that great price.  Both arrived with no seal, tops weren’t screwed tightly (luckily no spills) and the bottle necks were smushed.  Then read all the negative reviews. Sent online msg on Dr Teals website asking about why their products wouldn’t have seals and sent them the link to this product so they can be aware.  No reply of course.  Took two baths but will be throwing the remaining away since I did feel a skin burn and didn’t have a relaxing experience.  The smell is ok - but feel it’s possible product may not be true blue.

  I bought this because I couldn't get my Avon bubble bath, and the reviews said this was great stuff..lots and lots of bubbles. I liked the price point, so ordered 2 bottles. What a huge letdown!  I'm not sure what people are comparing the bubbles from this product to, but for me..a total fail!!!!  I had to use a third of the bottle to even get close to the amount of Avon bubbles from a capful.  On the upside, the smell is nice--but if I'm in the tub I want lots of bubbles, without using a ridiculous amount of product. I wont buy again.

I don’t have sensitive skin, so don’t know will this work on sensitive skin, always try with your hand or feet before put your whole body in it.

  Notice how the bottle is called FOAMING bath and not bubble bath, i bought this after seeing a photo of a woman as a glorious bubble monster, and was disappointed, after i used the entireeee 32 oz bottle and all we got was a mild foam, id would go to walmart and check out what they have there, i cant remember the name, but i bought this sleek white bubble bottle w green letters, it was branded for adults, and i poured like a 1/6th of it and there were soooooo many bubbles

  I haven’t noticed any pain relief. The smell is a little perfume-y. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft, so the oils do their job. The label says to be cautious of UTIs, which is kinda sketchy, especially since we bought it for our daughter who is in diapers. We don’t let her use it for that reason, and I’m slightly paranoid each time I use it

  I'm a big self care person. I was in need of a reasonably priced bubble bath product, and this definitely fits the bill. I bought both the lavender and eucalyptus scents. The lavender one is so nice and the scent is strong, but not overpowering. My only con about the product is that for the amount of liquid I pour into each bath, I would hope for more bubbles. I've taken about 5 baths and still have a quarter bottle left, so I am still very happy with this! I also use it after workouts to ease sore muscles.

  Unless you use almost the entire bottle you don’t get many bubbles out of it. I had to use about half the bottle to get even a couple inches of bubbles. It’s cheap but at that rate with my kids it only lasts a week. Alaffia cost a tiny bit more but lasts much longer, it’s fare trade, does great charity work, and is 100% biodegradable.

  Overall, it's a good product except for the amount required to generate bubbles. When the instructions say ""pour in a generous amount"", they aren't kidding. You may be wondering if the fact I needed to read ""bubble bath instructions"" undermines my credibility as a critic and that's fair, I guess.One bottle is good for about 10 bubbly baths. Compared with the inefficiency of bath bombs (a first world problem if ever there was...), this is the more frugal indulgence. But for the price, it remains underwhelming.I found the character of its lavender musk a bit cloying but maybe the clamminess of the bathroom and its squalid bare cfl bulb undermine its true allure.

  As good as any bubble bath and less expensive.  But why a 4?I remember bubble bath producing more bubbles, but that could be nostalgia.  Perhaps they removed a chemical that caused us to grow a third arm.But we know that to reduce crushing, tomatoes now have thicker skins and less flavor. (Tasteless I know..)And roses resist diseases better but don't smell the way they used to. ( A scentsless choice.)

  The product has arrived on time but the quality is very poor. It doesn't smell like lavender and you need to use a lot of it to make it foam. It also gave me an allergic reaction. My whole body was itchy after using it. I have never had this type of reaction to any other product. It must be something in the ingredients of this product.

  I was expecting this product to be better. The liquid is thick which made me hopeful that it would create a lot of bubbles and they would last, but it does not. I’ve used it a handful of times now and it has been the same each time - the bubbles are completely gone within 20 minutes. Each time I put a decent amount t in the tub (maybe 4 or 5 tablespoons?) and it has a lavender scent that isn’t too overpowering, however, I feel that if I put more in the scent will be too strong and cause a headache. The Epsom salts do help with pain relief, but I’ve found that regular Epsom salts on their own work better. Overall, not super impressed.

  I don’t even buy any other kind of bubble bath any more. These foam baths all smell wonderful, not like perfumes or chemicals, just lovely light scents. They make a great bubbly foamy bath, the bubbles last a long time, and they leave no yucky residue in the tub. The price is great too, usually around $5 for a 32 ounce bottle.

  While there are better and more expensive brands out there, I really find Dr. Teal's gives you the most bang for the buck.  I have used numerous scents from Dr. Teal's and found each to be enjoyable.  Dr. Teal's will not fill your bathtub with bubbles, but you will have plenty of suds.  I actually prefer the lower level of bubbles in this bath.  Furthermore, the fragrance is pleasant but not overpowering at all.  As the title suggests, Dr. Teal's is also a great value and is very long lasting with the 34oz size.

  The scent is nice and not overwhelming. I bought the bubble bath based on the reviews of lots of suds and bubbles. I don't know if I needed to pour a lot more out, but I used two caps fulls into the tub (half filled) and within ten mins the bubbles all disappeared. A little disappointed. I don't know if it is for sensitive skin but I wasn't irritated by the product. And it doesn't do anything for pain relief. I don't know why that was part of the review input. Maybe next time I'll try adding more bubble bath solution, but I feel like it would take like a quarter of the bottle.

  I bought this foaming bath product to use as shower gel.  I do like the scent - a soft lavender with a hint of vanilla - it's not as medicinal or herbal like some lavender products out there.  It cleans well, but doesn't leave much scent behind on the skin.  While I usually use shower gel or bar soap to shave my legs, I found this product to not work as well when shaving - I cut my legs a couple times, which is unusual for me - the product just doesn't have enough ""slip"".  Also, like others, I found it difficult to use this massive bottle in the shower, but I shouldn't be surprised, since this product is not an actual shower gel in a regular sized container; I've just decanted a smaller amount into another clean bottle, to make it easier to disperse in my hand in the shower.  Overall, the scent is good, it cleans well, and the price is very attractive - I'd purchase it again.

  I don’t know about pain relief because I’m honestly not sure if Epsom salt does anything for me, or if it’s just the soaking in hot water that helps, but this stuff is definitely a keeper regardless!It foams beautifully, smells lovely, and really does make for a relaxing bath!!! Perfect for unwinding at the end of the day and getting ready for bed.Since I have eczema and psoriasis, I didn’t use as much to create heavy bubbles like some have in the review pictures, but I still got a nice amount of bubbles without any irritation. This means that I can hopefully treat myself more than just a couple of times a year without “paying a price” to my skin. Hello stress relief!!!Also, my children used this stuff as well! The difference it made in their bedtime routine was jaw dropping!!! They fell asleep so much faster and actually seemed eggar to settle down for the night, as apposed to being  determined to stay up and play....All in all, we got about 14 baths out of one bottle, stress relief, the feeling of being pampered and getting a treat, and happy skin. Worth every penny! (Just keep in mind that I only half fill the tub for my kids because of splashing...)

  This is a very pleasant lavender aroma.  It's just the right potency so as not to be overwhelming as you're soaking.  The epsom salts are just what I need after a long day.  It really helps my low back pain and is very soothing for tired legs as well.  This creates lots of wonderful suds and makes quite the luxurious bath.  Even my husband uses it - it's not to 'girly' for him.  We've been using Dr. Teals for many years - this is one of our favorites.  We find that we both get a better night's rest as it helps us to relax and unwind from the hectic day.  Absolutely recommend!

  I used to spend a lot of money on bath bombs but always thought that was cost inefficient. Then, I saw this in my friend's bathroom and asked about it. She said she liked it so gave it a try since this was like $5 for a big bottle. When I first tried it, there was no bubbles and I kept on putting more and more... THEN, I read the instruction and it said put in while the water tab is running. I started seeing so much bubbles it was unbelievable. The second time, I used a good amount and it was amazing. This smells nice and it was very relaxing. Just remember, if you don't want to overuse this, make sure you have your water tab running when you put it in - it will create bubbles on its own. :)

  Some bubble baths don't foam up much, you have to put a lot in.  This one, you just drizzle it in under the running water and it foams up quite a bit.  Some bubble bath liquids have the consistency of water, which I personally find disturbing when I pour them into the tub.  Consistency of this product is pleasant, thicker like shampoo, etc.

  I like being able to relax with the lavender and epsom salt Foaming Bath liquid.

You don't have to use much to get the benefits.

  Alright, so I'm giving this five stars BUT only because this product met my expectations in a way I didn't intend. I was really hoping that even 1/4 of this product would create lots and lots of bubbles - I'm talking like the kind you see in the movies when the woman is drinking wine and settles back into a bath filled with bubbles that act to cover her up in the scene. Unfortunately, this product doesn't do that. I think I used 1/3 of the bottle and while I definitely had bubbles, it wasn't anything like the massive amount I was hoping for.That being said, the bubbles it did make (more like a thin layer), remained in the tub for the full 45 minutes I was in there. I'm pretty sure they would have stayed longer, too, but the water was cold so I wanted to get out. And the smell was REALLY nice.  My skin felt really soft, too.Did I get my Disney Princess/Lifetime movie bubbles? No. But honestly, it wasn't bad - I may just have to accept that I'll never get all my bubbles, which is more of a me-problem and not a product-problem.

  I dance and do lyra (aerial hoop) and aerial silks/hammock so I often end up with a lot of achiness and bruising around my legs/knee pits. This + reg ol' epsom salts in a hot bath, followed by a smothering of arnicare cream after I get out of the bath are a life-saver. I notice a visible difference before/after my baths - very red/sore before and less visible bruising/pain after. No pain the next day, too. Def recommend said routine for aerialists/dancers.

  This “foaming” bath with “long lasting bubbles” smells wonderful and the scents are soothing... But it barely foams let alone “bubbles” and neither scent nor the “foam” lasts very long at all.To be fair, the directions do say “pour a generous amount” under running water....But I had to dump about 1/5th of the 34oz bottle (so at least 6oz?) in to get even a small amount of bubbles.

  This product has worked wonders in my life. I have bad skin allergies. Anything from the wrong fabric against my skin to eating the wrong food. I get a full body rash pretty often. Bathing in this really helps soothe my skin during a flare up. I also tend to be an insomniac. This product helps get me to sleep and de-stress anytime I use it.

  Got these to replace my preschooler’s “Mr. Bubble” as he uses his nightly baths to wind down before bed. He has sensitive skin and I’ve noticed he is scratching less since switching.They put out enough bubbles to keep him from noticing a difference. I wish the scent were stronger, I was expecting the smell of lavender Epsom salts.All in all this is a great deal for a huge bottle. The packaging was very good- the bottle had leaked a tiny bit during shipping, but it was all contained in the plastic wrap covering the entire bottle. Had to use scissors to get it open!

  I got this for my teen son but it caused extreme itchiness all over. Both times, he drained the bath and refilled it with plain water to stop the itching. This happened twice, so we threw it out. He has no allergies or any previous sensitivity to anything. He has previously used other bubble baths and also plain epsom salts in the bath, without any problems. So I don't know what caused this itchy reaction, but I can't give it a good review, since it seems to have something in there which is an irritant.

  Beware! I don’t know If what I received is even the real legitimate Dr. Teal’s product or not, but it gave my 5 year old son a terrible, almost chemical burn-like reaction on his skin. I was really surprised given all the positive reviews on here, and given the fact that he does not have particularly sensitive skin - he’s never really broken out with a rash or anything like that before. I purchased it thinking the lavender would be a good relaxation aid for him before bed time. But after only a few minutes in his bath, he started screaming for me and saying his back was burning. I drained the bath and immediately washed him thoroughly with Dawn dish soap, but it still gave him that awful rash/burn you see in the picture. Thankfully, he did not seem to get any sort of burn/rash anywhere else. Be careful, especially with your little ones!

  I needed something to help me relax that was not a nap and this did it for me! I used the Foaming Bath with Epson Salt, Soothe & Sleep with Lavender, 34 oz bottle in an evening bath. Not only did it help me relax, it also helped me fall asleep so good that night. I tend to stay awake in bed (usually on my phone) most nights, but after this bath I fell asleep right away. It didn't bubble a whole lot for me, but it smelled amazing and made my skin the softest it's been in a long time! It's a good sized bottle (34oz) with a sufficient amount of baths per bottle.Overall, I loved it.  I don't take baths too often, but this has inspired me to do this more! 10/10 would buy again. Maybe even in the different scents to mix up my baths a little bit.

  I would like to start with what I liked about this product, it smells great! It doesn’t make my skin feel dry, and it’s kiddo approved.What I didn’t like... When I first received the product the bottle was all beat up in the box, but I thought whatever the reviews are good. However the bubbles are extremely underwhelming.I started with a capful after a time but once I was at 1/2c or so of soap I figured there was no use adding more since the bubbles weren’t multiplying.I’m still in the market for a new bubble soap..

    Ignore the directions - will not bubble well on its own under a faucet
  
",3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,anonymouse,2020年9月18日 在美国审核,"









  
  
    
  When i first tried it out (it was also my first time using bubble bath foam), I was severely disappointed because there were almost no bubbles and I had followed the directions exactly, which was simply to run a cap or two directly under a warm/hot water stream. The lavender smell was fine and not too overwhelming to me, but I was still grumbling about the lack of bubbles and almost threw the bottle away. Weeks later, I stumbled across a ytube video of a person using a handheld electric mixer whisk into a bubble bath, and POOF, bubbles spouted instantly. Since there are obvious dangers to using electronics near water, I got the idea to just use my hands to flap and stir rapidly like in a whisking motion near the running water. As stupid and silly as this seems, IT WORKS to create REAL bubbles to fill the bath. About 5-7 minutes of on-and-off hand whisking (using about 1-2 cap fulls per minute) is enough to get a good inch layer of bubbles to cover a normal economy-sized tub. After 2-3 baths using this method, I still have about 60% of the bottle left. Can't say how much this bottle would last if you're trying to fill a giant fancy jacuzzi or hot tub.Overall, despite having to exercise my wrists and arms a bit, I feel much happier that at least I found a simple way to get real bubbles without any fancy tools and that this bottle won't have to go to waste after all!

  Smell is okay. Subtle. But this stuff burns my skin. After maybe 5 minutes in the water I'm stinging all over. I don't have this issue with their regular epsom salts or essential oil espom salts, just this bubble bath. Which, by the way, isn't a great bubble bath. There aren't many bubbles from the start and they fade away after a few minutes.

  I can’t thank you enough for the lavender bubble bath! My 2 youngest daughters are 3 and 4. And when I tell you they fight their sleep baddd, I mean they have laid awake until almost morning until they finally crashed. They are extremely active little girls with ants in their pants. They are constantly on the move. Which is expected with kids. But I’m sure we can all agree, can drive us crazy sometimes lol. Sometimes, us moms -dad’s too!- just need an early night so we can have some quiet!I bought this originally because I had a coupon code and the deal was too good to pass up. Besides, what’s a bath to little girls with no bubbles!? It just isn’t fun. So, after our first use, they got out the tubby and into their jammies. Within 20 minutes they were both knocked out completely! I was even able to carry them into bed without waking up.At first I wasn’t sure if was from the bubbles. We used the last bit of our old ones in the next bath and they were jumping off the walls all night again. Well, next tubby we used the dr teals and the moment their little heads laid on the pillows they were sleeping!I will never not use this again! I’d also like to point out that my kids are allergic to almost everything you can imagine with the most sensitive skin I’ve ever seen. And they have zero issues with this.I without a doubt wish I could rate this over 100 stars. This has become my saving Grace. I’d also pay quadruple the price for how amazing this is! Who would’ve ever thought a bubble bath would save my sanity and put my kids right to sleep! Not I!!Dr Teals has out done themselves with this! If there is one thing you need in your house with young children, it’s Dr Teals lavender bubble bath!!!

  It is quite unfortunate that Dr. Teal soothe and sleep with lavender forming bath with epsom salt 1). Does not soothe your body to promote better sleep, 2.) nourishes your skin, 3.) and does not have long lasting bubbles gently cleanse. I gave it a second change and the same results. You have to pour in half the bottle to get a decent bubble bath. I had to add my own essentials oils. Steer clear! Stick with the kids bubble bath or the Calgon Bubble Bath. This product is not worth the money and it is a shame because it is affordable but cheap is just what you get if the product doesn’t hold up to standard.
